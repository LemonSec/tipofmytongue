1
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:36,050
getting up so early

2
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,850
notes 9 a.m. on a Sunday and it was a
really nice party last night that I

3
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,930
didn't get so much up so my name is
Michael view on this lovely gentleman is

4
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:53,930
Kevin bond so we're gonna talk about
writers today

5
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,540
dropbox is particularly a little bit
about ourselves real quick

6
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,870
penetration tester have been for a
couple years now always work on hardware

7
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:12,470
stuff kind of various projects and
things the current maintainer think I

8
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:19,820
scare me never said I was looking at the
current maintainer of the million dollar

9
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:30,130
project I do the same thing and I
started to be project two years ago I'm

10
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:35,920
Kevin I do the same thing michael does
and I started the project few years ago

11
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,350
and a lot of talk about today is this
kind of based on some of that diverted

12
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:47,610
from some of that as well so the
shameless company plug that they make us

13
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,580
put on oliver slide decks the members of

14
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:58,330
LLP 43 laps as a subdivision of that so
basically what we do is to USA and PCI

15
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:05,220
assessments lot of p2p things like that
and a pen tester their team so I do a

16
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,080
lot of penetration tests for PCI
compliance in ninety-eight compliance

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,480
Kevin obviously does similar things as
us while we do all kinds of stuff around

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,320
scanner and PCI forensics investigating
team as well so if you are in need of

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,819
any of those services

20
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:30,439
shameless plug over so what this artist
really gonna be about is you know you go

21
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,629
into the field on a penetration test and
you don't have a drop box with you

22
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:39,329
either you forgot to pack 1 or you're
traveling long distances and you can't

23
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:43,019
pack everything right now like to try
but can't bring everything so what do

24
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,019
you do you go into you doing recon late
at night you figure out boy Dropbox be

25
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,010
great right so how do you build one on
the fly

26
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,189
what is a Dropbox for those of us that
don't know getting there talking about

27
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:06,480
it I mister Chris Jones and it showed up
today to talk about what we need to do

28
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,669
and where you can find some things so
yes we're talking about Dropbox hardware

29
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:22,439
and other good stuff so I Dropbox I
guess I need to find a drop box but a

30
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,239
drop box basically is a small portable
router such as these little wonderful

31
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,000
little choice we have up here they come
in all different shapes and sizes

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,870
primarily they're going to run some kind
of Linux distribution we focus mostly

33
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,949
open work lots of great tools out there
i think probably linked tp-link is

34
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:45,299
probably the biggest brands they support
but there's lots of different ones

35
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,569
de-link Linksys all kinds of roads out
there but they're great little boxes

36
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:57,120
normally they'll have a wireless adapter
and one ethernet adapter so they're good

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,310
to stick under chairs put in lobbies

38
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,739
put behind things in getting dragged
into the network and give yourself a

39
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,959
remote access point into that network
which won't talk about it later as well

40
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,530
so we like to use them mostly on covert
like black box social engineering

41
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:21,880
engagements will drop them off and just
random networks if you look at what's on

42
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,900
the network see if we can maybe do some
protections if we could find any cash

43
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,160
flowed around anything like that and
most importantly I think they should be

44
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,139
cheap because if you're on a black box
engagement engagement there's there's a

45
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,870
possibility of someone's gonna find it
and throw it away right or keep it for

46
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,970
themselves so we don't want them to be a
$100 because that would make me cry a

47
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:53,820
little bit of a lost one so the final
hardware like to say yes to think

48
00:04:53,820 --> 00:05:05,789
outside the box to find your box so we
found jobs is as good as it gets so

49
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:10,789
local stores obviously Walmart Target
fun a lot of Fry's Electronics actually

50
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:14,770
we also found one off craigslist which
was great

51
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:20,330
was able to get there in about an hour
with the guy came upon some good well

52
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,780
then have a chance to hit up any good
rummage sales in my area from Wisconsin

53
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,460
so wasn't much else but flea markets as
well so depending on where you're at

54
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,860
think about secondhand routers that's
all you really need great get one for 25

55
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,600
bucks 30 bux index of the second and
routers lot of times are working out

56
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,830
better because the newest riders often
don't have a firm where new firmware

57
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,180
upgrade firmware for them yet whereas
the ones you find a Roman sales if they

58
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,780
supported they probably already that's
good point

59
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,460
so this was this was probably the
hardest part because we're men and we

60
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:03,010
had to go shopping so we we did a little
exploration and found at several

61
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,380
different writers a letter from places
like I said we've got some all over the

62
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,380
place so one of the biggest problems
will find that are not all runners run

63
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,250
on battery power but so we did some
experiments with that and found that

64
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,320
actually 29 votes or 49 goals however
many you got

65
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,990
works extremely well so we did it as you
can see in the picture on the right hand

66
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,830
side we took some the cable that
actually the power cable that came with

67
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,760
the router and cut it up we could just
change a couple of naval together and

68
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,220
actually make a really good power supply
four double A's work for Kevin don't

69
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,760
really work well for me because they're
around in the kept falling off the

70
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,090
router and try to tape around things to
service is not easy

71
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,700
the Big Six boatman back worked
extremely well but that's for one of

72
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,979
those camping lights

73
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:59,650
you know it's like this big so it's not
exactly inconspicuous but it worked

74
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,570
worked for a very long time actually yes
the key thing I hear the routers all say

75
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,490
like in football votes but actually
crack it open and look at the chip

76
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,919
that's the power converter you can
figure out that will that chip actually

77
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,300
works anywhere from 7 votes to 20 votes
or something like that you just need

78
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,530
some voltage in that range and Michael
said almost every I think every robbery

79
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,320
had accepted the 50 ones were fine at
nine goals so the name of matters work

80
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,030
well yeah I think one of the problems
was the six volt input from the four

81
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,530
double A's I was having issues with that
but it works really well with election

82
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,020
better and it was kind of cool because
one of her big goals was can I get like

83
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,919
one trip to Walmart and walk out with
everything and Dropbox or maybe a couple

84
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,580
of trips and and saying I could get you
know electrical tape skipping ahead here

85
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,590
ok

86
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,770
its cool so we did some power testing on
those these are all running out of

87
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,000
battery on notice next to the router we
have the type of voltage used so some of

88
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,980
these internal batteries so we can't
really tell us very well be able to buy

89
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:10,060
votes so you got running load peak and
whites as far as some power output for

90
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,120
you to look at which again is really
cool the role of the routers you know

91
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,410
they come with a 10 amp power adapter
you like I can't run like something out

92
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,350
of battery that but if you actually look
only drawing hundred-million one-tenth

93
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:42,630
of that little matter how much power as
a nine volt battery so we experimented

94
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,240
picked one cuz batteries are not exactly
cheap especially not philosophy about

95
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,800
that kind of crazy expensive so I just
picked up one router this guy actually

96
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:03,020
the WRA 42 and you can see here the cost
and in the runtime better shut up so and

97
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:09,430
I think here so this writer had like a
$200 a poll so if you travel writers you

98
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,370
probably get almost twice as much time
off the same battery is travel router

99
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,750
with the battery built-in that we didn't
we couldn't you know I think the thirty

100
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,250
forty that I don't usually see what
we've got here that when I run like 10

101
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,730
12 hours I think battery this one when
we started driving down on Thursday I

102
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,680
turned it on and started where she is
Matt sniffing and just left it on the

103
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,880
whole weekend it died sometime yesterday
evening so internal battery ran for

104
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,649
Thursday morning till last night you can
find one of those obviously that's

105
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,160
that's the goal that's the mother ship
you got the better to do anything else

106
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,829
nice so this isn't really too big of a
surprise and I'm not gonna read it all

107
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:59,220
to you but the different routers that we
tested essentially are extremely

108
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,410
comparables for CPU RAM I think the
biggest thing you're gonna world

109
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,999
explorers if it has a battery or if it
supports USB Drive one of things we can

110
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,170
do obviously with the USB Drive is
expand the internal memory capabilities

111
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:19,769
of it right because normally these have
48 megs of memory and if we can put a 16

112
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:24,040
gig card in it better there there's a
tear on the slide

113
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:34,149
price for whoever anybody that Ram
College / that we're moving fast

114
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:45,800
everyday everyday work with this every
day so signal strength we did some

115
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,399
signal strength measurements that are
locally building their tickets that's

116
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,970
picture was taken back from where I was
standing with an elephant if I BB

117
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,309
antenna is kind of hard to see but
essentially the third we're on the third

118
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:03,610
floor about this window issue in and
back here supreme much in the center of

119
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,059
the building we put these routers these
roads right here in one of the cubicles

120
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:16,980
and we went outside our alpha and was
able to get access to all the ones that

121
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:26,829
we tested so pretty good range even for
something with a built-in on 1000 3042

122
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:42,369
3043 13 you that's the 31 was pretty
good as it has michaels in love with

123
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,810
this router

124
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:53,810
so I am so we did some tests

125
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,620
there's a practicality tests and try to
figure out where can we actually had

126
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,060
these things right because that's part
of being a Dropbox as we have to put

127
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,779
them in a covert location so I'm sure
you've all seen these little things

128
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:11,460
before on top of copper cables right no
pope plugin stuff well he's actually

129
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,700
work really well but this little guy the
Nexus fits in there almost perfectly and

130
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,240
it's got USB and Ethernet everything or
power and Ethernet everything right in

131
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,000
the little slut so just to get in there
with the cords and injured gold not many

132
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,630
people use them in our office or
probably sit there for quite some time

133
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:35,540
we also found a person behind their
cutting machine is great and we've we've

134
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,930
expanded our colleague of mine called
the Internet of Things and we plugged

135
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:48,120
into a plant so I don't think that would
be suspicious at all in this day and age

136
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,290
surprisingly easy to hide these big
rummage sale routers in the office in

137
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:06,790
completely in conspicuous places will
process the build process what you're

138
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,060
gonna need obviously the rotors and
batteries black tape is the most

139
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,360
user-friendly and of course if you don't
have a wire cutters at Walmart phone

140
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,880
utility network said there's

141
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,160
but as far as most of these riders go to
fall under this category you can install

142
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,270
open work from the web interface so you
just open up the web interface the

143
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:37,360
router and you go in and reflects the
firmware download the correct image

144
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,840
problem or its website and you get a
flash and install the packages you want

145
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,170
your done it's very straightforward some
of the writers were a little bit more

146
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,160
difficult again like the 842

147
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,970
with this one I found that it does have
a five port switch on the back so if you

148
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:05,310
wanna take advantage of that but i dun
is washed out openwork download the

149
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:11,080
correct package flashed it I was able to
back up to the config files the network

150
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:18,160
in the wireless configs I was able to
get a USB port on it so I put a eight

151
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,920
gig USB stick it could put the money
power overlay package on it that is on

152
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,340
the site and expand the memory so now
it's got eight megs internal storage and

153
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,960
I can just replace these two networking
wireless files and I have access back to

154
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:42,730
the five port switch which is really the
Linksys we bought didn't make it today

155
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:49,990
crisis for 30 bucks which wasn't bad got
him down to 25 in a couple of emails

156
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,240
picked it up and was able to flash it
that afternoon so it was very convenient

157
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,710
I was really close to our office so that
the only problem with such an old router

158
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,110
is it have to go back to backfire

159
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:11,570
that's a pretty bold package so then
have a lot of capability but it would

160
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,860
you know would let me on the network it
was an access point I can get in maybe

161
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:21,209
use it as a bit something like that so
it worked but fortunately not everything

162
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:29,899
does work this was an exterior 300 that
I got didn't check out of anyone's ever

163
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:35,339
try to flash a netgear router before the
instructions are fairly convoluted on

164
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,329
the site and get to go through a lot of
different steps and it did not make it

165
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:50,860
so it's memorial service so and and
ideally if you're out doing this and you

166
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,890
find it a thirty forty or something like
this from tp-link it's awesome got a USB

167
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,459
ports got the battery in and you just
put the firmware are you ready to go but

168
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,430
if you're in a pinch like we're seeing
in this talk that's maybe not likely the

169
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:08,339
case you know the couple that I found
where I found the WRT 160 and its kinda

170
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,649
like a 54 G found that goodwill other
networks one at Microcenter on clearance

171
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:22,550
but the thing about both of these is I'm
both of those when I tried to flash of

172
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,649
the flashing failed and both of them
have a battery both of them they don't

173
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:26,870
have a USB port

174
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:32,160
pinch if the flashing fails through the
web interface it's not the end of the

175
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,420
world most of these devices have an
internal Serial Port and I gotta go

176
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,060
through the steps for serial crack
flashing but just to not be afraid of it

177
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,449
what you do need though is a TTL serial
adapter I got a picture of one there you

178
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,820
know you want to get into hardware
hacking go buy one of these now the only

179
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,209
two bucks but it lets you talk between a
computer and

180
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:58,019
computer ice rider Cyril device using
serial protocols if you don't have one

181
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,819
of those in need want to pinch you like
I'm never gonna find that at Radio Shack

182
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:06,360
or something there there is a hack in
the heck is an Arduino can be used as a

183
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,939
TTL serial adapter certain Arduino is
mostly Arduino and those that have that

184
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,390
same FDIC ruled after trip on them
things like the Nano things like the

185
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:24,010
standard Arduino Uno all you need to do
is short the ground or short the reset

186
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,789
pin to ground and that puts the CPU the
Arduino and kind of a completely turned

187
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:32,830
off state more or less and you just use
the serial adapter on it then to connect

188
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,690
through and got a picture that before I
can do that I need to find this year

189
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,020
ports on the router

190
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,909
most of these routers I'm finding that
do have see reports on the inside

191
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,299
they're not too hard to find you

192
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,880
Google on the internet and somebody else
re taking a picture so on the left hand

193
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,940
side there is the end 152 actually had a
row of pins with already in place to

194
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,789
find on the internet which was ground
which was txin are X 160 and this black

195
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:04,440
one here did not have pins but it had
little pads and the Internet knew what

196
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,380
those pads were those pads work satiric
so I just had to sit on my phone wires

197
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,470
again hard to do if you're like trying
to do it at night it from Walmart or

198
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:15,429
something but it's got a little more
time I got a soldering iron you can do

199
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,250
that

200
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,140
things like that right so you can do it
you can find that stuff that usually

201
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,049
harder or easier to somewhere but it's
going to cost a little bit more than 40

202
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:32,870
bucks here's a real quick picture of you
know doing a serial flash using an

203
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,520
Arduino psychotic pewter connected the
Arduino the green cable there is

204
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,919
connecting the ground to the reset pin
which tells the Arduino CPU to turn off

205
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,640
but now my my Arduino is acting like a
USB to serial adapter and I've got the

206
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:52,059
street i wires for ground and then I'm
not gonna go through the destructions to

207
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:55,250
flash their different from most every
different router but most of the riders

208
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,320
you have not there

209
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,230
it's not that scary don't be afraid to
do it so to actually build the thing

210
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,190
will need a laptop with an Ethernet port
on there because the new ultrabooks oh

211
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:15,070
come on the internet as I've discovered
in a recent issue never cable obviously

212
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,570
the image and then we're going to talk
about you is the image generator how to

213
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,399
get some of these tools are here at such
a small footprint is where the problem

214
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:28,899
that we have is obviously not a lot of
room so you've got you know when you

215
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:35,389
load the operating system this is calmer
and you don't have a whole lot of room

216
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:39,169
left for any kind of tools after you get
the operating system lay down here so

217
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:45,139
what can we do about that the one thing
that we like to do about that is build

218
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:48,789
our own image which actually is a lot
easier than it sounds

219
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:56,429
there's a great Wiki article out there
on their work how to build it so follow

220
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,549
those steps a couple of the the short
ones that have for that you're going to

221
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:07,039
watch out for is check out the
repositories file to talk about the

222
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,730
second you want to modify this is
specific to the tp-link 3040 obviously

223
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:18,649
you gonna want to modify the profile
that's applicable to your router and

224
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:25,320
then we actually just used to make
managed to build it so I know this is

225
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,960
extremely small and hard to read

226
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:37,299
yes we are so we had to be on the
website so if you wanna go afterward you

227
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:39,970
have to remember the demo stuff we're
going to get through some things double

228
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,159
slides hopefully keep time are actually
doing this

229
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,029
afterwards right yet the big thing is
obviously make sure we're doing is

230
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:51,629
putting the packages in here in this
demonstration were using barrier breaker

231
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:55,860
but if you want to use any of the other
ones just make sure that the correct

232
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,760
files this is the modification of the
tp-link

233
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,090
the important thing to take away here
under the packages section this is the

234
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:10,970
default comes on it but again and it's
really hard to see you'll notice at the

235
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,610
at the end where my nasty things over to
take off

236
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:21,590
iptables DPP IV table 6 DCP six things
like that

237
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,500
doing a 96 assessment we don't need
these tools we just really want a pivot

238
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,030
point into the environment so what we're
gonna do is sacrifice some of these

239
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:37,660
items save us some space and put other
tools in their place real quick example

240
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,320
of a make working and family as well
looks like when I succeeds on the top

241
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,420
also completed the file and then you'll
see something if you try to put too many

242
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:54,740
tools on there like one of the bigger
tools it'll say image to enlarge image

243
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:02,410
too big so it's pretty obvious I think
it fit so yeah and why do you want to do

244
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,190
this is really actually pretty cool you
know so like this router here has four

245
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,200
megabytes of internal flash if i
download the stock openwork image for it

246
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,930
it's under four megabytes but it's got
it doesn't have any tools out of the ITC

247
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,510
puppy dog or cat on it and it doesn't
have a USB port so i cant add those

248
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,950
things like using outside storage so
this image builder lets me take that

249
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:30,480
stock image make it smaller and then add
the tools I want back to that image and

250
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,370
it actually you want to add the tools
you want to the image you could install

251
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,590
them later but you probably run out of
space and that's because there's really

252
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,630
cool thing on that it uses called squash
a fast does some of the standard

253
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,490
compression of the file system but it
does some other cool stuff too like if

254
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,930
there's a file fragment that small that
whole block size it actually put more

255
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,440
file fragments in that same block so
it's really really efficient using size

256
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,710
of the router and if there's a tool that
you can't install afterwards after the

257
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,450
images built you might be able to sit on
the image beforehand because of the way

258
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:11,230
squash effect works for school and don't
be afraid of building your own image I'm

259
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:18,810
a lonely man I'm in love with the router
say as we said obviously you've got

260
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:25,830
limited space so they're ready we can
use I mean other packages inside the

261
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,780
opening were operating system that we
can utilize an work with and if not try

262
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,780
to find tools with multiple purposes
like will see that cats one of our

263
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,950
favorite ones right can use that for all
kinds of different things so speaking of

264
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,760
neck at these are some of my choices
definitely want to get open SSH on their

265
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,990
do a lot of reverse tunnels things like
that

266
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:55,220
control cells back out yourself neck had
again very useful can use it as a port

267
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,700
scanner and use it as a reverse
connection into the environment if you

268
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,760
have the room if you got outside storage
obvious the best I can be a problem

269
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,620
control kinds of things on there but
mostly I like to use and mapping and TCP

270
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,070
DUP so what else for tools are pretty
much can do a lot of things in the

271
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,910
environment and I was given again the
router that didn't have any space left

272
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,640
and it's all the tools I I would choose
they're actually shows their feet up and

273
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,900
that can just I really love doing this
because you're getting kinda back to the

274
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,710
roots of you know I don't have all these
fully featured tools I have to learn to

275
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,660
be creative with these kind of tools and
will show some ways you can be created

276
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,260
with just these two tools and some
upcoming sites here

277
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,990
so with netcat I'm sure you guys already
know all this for you can you can google

278
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,350
it up yourselves cheat sheets out there
but it's just some of the favorite

279
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,910
senator up give yourself a quick port
scanner obviously reverse shells a

280
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,120
favorite for netcat but then also I
thought was interesting is a better

281
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,370
driver for IP addresses in environments
that can cause he was running on these

282
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:04,860
things before you start to attack a
handy here's a really cool thing so what

283
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,880
are the biggest challenges I came to we
started using the event as drop boxes

284
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,210
was ok the drop boxes on the target
network I'm out the parking lot on a

285
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,090
different network range and I find a
sequel server I find some server on

286
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,560
attack I don't have a tool on the router
to attack that I've made a splash on the

287
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,420
router something all I need on that
router to be able to tack that database

288
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,540
on the inside from my laptop is netcat
if you've been through like the sands at

289
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,840
school buses hacker techniques course we
spent like three hours on that cat

290
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,180
wizardry this is just one of those where
you're using netcat to open up to

291
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,340
connections going both directions and
just using that can't afford for traffic

292
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,630
from the laptop through the router to
the example single database on the

293
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,040
internet work in this case it was a
website on the internet work is my home

294
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,440
router or whatever but that device on
the internal network to it looks like

295
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,470
traffic coming from the local network
it's coming from the router even those

296
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:07,910
originating from my box it's really
pretty slick so again tcpdump couple

297
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,430
quick commands when we can double D's
actually this should work on the

298
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:19,240
internal network tested these yesterday
but so what we're doing here is a simple

299
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,340
catching broadcast multicast addresses
so we can kind of see what's out there

300
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,660
so we're just listening on the network

301
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,850
second one really setting this up to be
a rudimentary port scanner so we're

302
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,900
gonna do is we're gonna catch any I seem
ICMP packets I come back to my IP

303
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,820
address are destined for my IP address
from something the internal network and

304
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,390
then I'm going to set up a simple fast
forward to enumerate all the different

305
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,330
hosts on that network and then I'm going
to be able to see my other window and to

306
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:57,940
speed up what's responded very quickly
here is just if if you're a good way to

307
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:04,160
do with his feet up meetings for SEO
means capital packed packet test W means

308
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,560
right to file I'll put up the cap was
interesting to if you've got a USB Drive

309
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,400
you can I'll put that local USB Drive
another one of the tricks I think it

310
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,970
shows in the afternoon talk that will be
giving you can actually type that out

311
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,300
through nightcap to your laptop and so
you don't need memory on the router to

312
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,210
write that output file to you cannot put
it live to a remote system with TCP up

313
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:37,370
and then kept under so organization may
have some kind of guessing you guys are

314
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:47,270
familiar with this but set up a reverse
SSH connection from a drop box too and

315
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:52,440
then from localhost as I'm just some
basic commands it would like to use if

316
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,290
you have those available and this is
called highlighted we didn't think we

317
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,480
did bring up where you dropped as
backdrops got two ways to connect back

318
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,680
it's gotten even a party workers got the
wireless router you can go in the

319
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,420
parking lot but you could also add that
Ethernet port gives you access to the

320
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,150
internet through the targets network
that's where especially the so called us

321
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,140
a call back can be pretty cool it can
call back

322
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,510
establish connection back to your home
network but you never be doing this from

323
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:31,500
home from a legitimate authorised work
environment but watch so and map we've

324
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:40,520
got some basic scans on there like the
big takeaway of these is due the out

325
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,720
there or a for cuts all output so that's
gives you the global standard and map

326
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,380
and XML files can be imported into
different tools it's really handy

327
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:57,350
sleeper scanning so this is just gonna
be a ping sweep basically no DNS

328
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:05,940
resolution for the dash and more verbose
SIV obviously gives you service version

329
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,610
information and tells you what
information its findings from from

330
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,820
different services so that's also handy
cuz port 80 doesn't necessarily always

331
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:25,140
been a web interface right so good stuff
you know and I want to the devils and

332
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,750
hopefully my official sacrifice the
other day

333
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:38,990
demagogues actually left my router that
I was going to reflash at home they

334
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,480
realized it like two days ago and I'm
sitting and talking somebody had failed

335
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,970
on that man I hope mine doesn't now and
then it dawned on me that my router

336
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:53,760
Wisconsin and as evidence we could not
find anywhere in Louisville to buy a

337
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,850
nice travel router so this doesn't work
in all places

338
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:06,270
check Craigslist that anyway so we got a
thirty forty be flashed it back to its

339
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,340
original state this was a minibar like
two days ago

340
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:19,240
box yeah so we just login to the web
interface rate that one system tools

341
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:31,390
very easy to do it has never been easier
to be a hardware happier right until you

342
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:43,810
lose the image of course for sure when a
parade we have read all instructions

343
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:50,220
says only takes a couple of minutes to
upgrade its gonna be booed biggest

344
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,810
problem with it rebooting is it will
move away from the zeroed out 10 2012 at

345
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:01,570
one address so something to remember I
think all openwork defaults to 192 168 1

346
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:08,380
2011 that's taken yet we feel like
you're like the whole life they're all

347
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,750
open we're compatible they're all really
easy to flash her live from that point I

348
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:21,300
think they all have to think of other
brands that worked well for us you know

349
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,640
certainly the it's actually hard to find
some of the other more you know the

350
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:32,750
Walmart resurrection cut off to find
ones that work well for open work I

351
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:43,080
don't be to set it so when you're in the
store with your Walmart your router and

352
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,310
then you put your website of the tables
where you can like look through yet

353
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,030
together

354
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,680
that's kinda how you pick out when
you're in the store is this gonna work

355
00:31:52,680 --> 00:32:03,310
is kinda phone on the openwork website
questions will be taking use the demo

356
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:20,800
this is the 13 you I don't see the FCC
label on it so just FYI you get it from

357
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:26,340
China and its not FCC approved the
thirty forty that he's working on now is

358
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:44,670
aren't this thirty twenty years now we
can think so yet as the way that kind of

359
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:49,490
work you you can you ping when it did
not want that one that the fault of any

360
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:55,710
kind of open or rather a few flashes
obviously the the tp-link interface with

361
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:30,830
a way to get the the new password said I
will see that a lot of space on here to

362
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:37,050
look at that cat this is a busy backs
version of netcat there is no TCB dumped

363
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:46,210
on this particular box right now for the
fun demo so normally now at that point

364
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,980
you would do so

365
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:53,190
normally if you got space now you would
do if you want to solve those tools you

366
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,549
would connect the router the internet
there's how to do that to figure why

367
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:03,000
fire ever get any wifi then you do with
the total package or pkg dunno package

368
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,750
update which pulls all the packages
installed our annual package installer

369
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:16,210
package salty sea dog it's all those
things right to the last remaining so

370
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:23,460
this is the repository file a little bit
like the show now is building that

371
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,169
custom firmware where we said ok we need
to remove some of these we have more

372
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:33,109
space in my dad's until the firmware
this is step-by-step to do that right

373
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:40,440
giving your talk this afternoon but
alright so yes this is the generator

374
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,200
tool so what we've done is we've gone
ahead and downloaded it is about 80 mag

375
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,419
so you probably want a decent internet
connection when you do this did it

376
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:52,139
yesterday here actually at the
conference of politic about 10 minutes

377
00:34:52,139 --> 00:35:02,270
not too bad but it comes on the scene
and extract that you get all the the

378
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,619
files that you need if you take a look
at the repository file all these files

379
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,550
were not all this information right here
was identified yesterday Addison

380
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:17,300
manually and you can actually find us on
the 22 on the open door tutorial wiki

381
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,210
page and how to do this

382
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:24,720
basically it's just all the source
barrier breaker whatever the sub package

383
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,940
name as and then obviously the URL to
where it actually is these obviously

384
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,550
will change if you're using chaos kamar
aur

385
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,840
attitude adjustment or anything like
that but I used the chaos kamar package

386
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,910
builder is it was already in there
correctly so I think barrier breaker was

387
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,680
the weird one

388
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:52,760
yeah so very done that the other file
that you want to read it as the where is

389
00:35:52,760 --> 00:36:12,890
it targets links and in here so these
are all the different profiles that

390
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:20,930
comes with the box to take a look at the
backup file if you search through here

391
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:27,090
for thirty forty you'll notice under the
pact section and only comes really with

392
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:34,770
bare minimum USB stuff built-in there's
another generic template file elsewhere

393
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,940
that has all the other packages that all
the all the images would have but this

394
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,000
one because not everybody has to be the
only at the USB stuff throughout the WSB

395
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:57,160
stuff like that so far the edited
version left all the USB stuff in there

396
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,720
was maybe I'll get lucky and got on with
USB support USB chip in it but I've

397
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,330
added tcpdump well but we'll see that's
going to fail

398
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:12,070
cat and subtracting packages it's just
as easy as putting a dash in front of

399
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:17,630
its actually just want to track that
package can subtract any packages that

400
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:25,270
are in the the base image for over 24
hours

401
00:37:25,270 --> 00:38:02,870
can I thank you let me all right so this
is gonna fail because added in and map

402
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,050
in there we know that's going to be too
big of a package but when go ahead and

403
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:28,990
oblique profile I really do this for a
living which is scary and we really want

404
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:34,070
to I i started building open where
others like this

405
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:40,530
like many pointer project back into 2012
and I don't actually use the image

406
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,390
builder until like two months ago we're
prepping for the stock has a building

407
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,210
that looks complicated do and it's like
this is crazy I wasn't doing this years

408
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,790
ago so simple

409
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,830
should be able to add packages you can
add or remove or change filename well

410
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:58,030
through just say I don't want this file
that's on there I want my own

411
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:02,360
here's the contents of it it's just
almost trivial to tell the image builder

412
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:08,000
to use your file instead of the one
thousand so see obviously their image to

413
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,270
enlarge

414
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:38,310
so go back in and we'll get rid of the
package

415
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:47,850
3040 the maximum image sizes and
actually out of the maximum image size

416
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:51,850
it knows the image size what a great
image needs to be exactly this so if it

417
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,580
ends up smaller little pat it so one of
the things we'll see as we may see it

418
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,690
when it creates the image files gonna be
the same size even it's got different

419
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:07,860
packages in it so go ahead and make that
again this time hopefully it will

420
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:12,430
succeed have no Demel fail one thing
that I never figured out when I was

421
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:18,230
doing this is i would run the make and
it would fail I forgive the error was I

422
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,170
just read it again immediately and it
would work and I think there's maybe

423
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,200
something out of order where it was
trying to download packages after was

424
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,300
trying to include him or something so if
things are weird right at a few times

425
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,750
over just to make sure thats not the
problem you're having so it's actually

426
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:45,100
completed this time the binaries for us
so that's good they are in here one

427
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:52,610
thing you'll notice it creates them all
so kind of overkill but it is doing it

428
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:56,810
in under an hour so we don't really take
the time to strip all that away and we

429
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,130
figure you're buying a router you're
downloading

430
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,530
all these image builders you're
stripping out image packages pretty more

431
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,710
packages in and getting it in there were
trying to do it as quickly as possible

432
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:24,770
but if we take a look here are images
you'll notice that the standard factory

433
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,980
squash images 3.8 mags which is what it
always should be

434
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,390
you look at it from a bite standpoint
it's always exactly the same as well so

435
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:48,290
what I can do is copy this

436
00:41:48,290 --> 00:42:02,800
yes so sorry show you know how it moves
over to the last ones who got this new

437
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:11,720
firmware on it is back at one place to
another

438
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:27,220
no no it's fine I'm even done it this
far so the sooner so it's and see that

439
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,799
shelf space desk people or

440
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:47,450
report

441
00:42:47,450 --> 00:43:11,880
right now we're in it so you don't want
to go into temper at least redirected to

442
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,390
temp because that's where are your
spaces right now got these little

443
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:25,180
buggers 3040 has got 16 mags / just so
you can store is big enough to store

444
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,680
stuff on there and temporary standpoint
as long as you don't reboot it powered

445
00:43:28,680 --> 00:44:12,040
off your gonna be fine because the file
in the same yeah you're known as like

446
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,720
having just said obviously it exited out
that cat scan on both sides so we'll

447
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,290
tell you that it's finished and then
this is probably the biggest part that

448
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:30,309
people get confused on or scared about
but it's just empty d

449
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:35,359
is based whatever image that you want to
put on there and then we're going to

450
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,189
take that image violin right at the
firmware so reflashing 126 it's never

451
00:44:39,189 --> 00:44:46,829
difficult and if you were to break this
and it didn't work very well liked some

452
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:49,910
of the ones I've done in the past with
the serial interface is really good for

453
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,859
so you get to a from a social
perspective and then get that new image

454
00:44:53,859 --> 00:45:42,759
uploaded onto the router and do this did
the same thing comes up to me and I'm

455
00:45:42,759 --> 00:45:50,429
hoping the democrats are so so since we
just flashed it we do have to turn their

456
00:45:50,429 --> 00:46:03,359
back into it so it's not the busybox
version it's a full version of Mecca and

457
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:10,640
we also have to say

458
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:22,890
yeah you know that the path to the way
for the rest of the day but do not be

459
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:26,640
afraid very afraid

460
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:35,589
rape and so do not be afraid you're not
a saudi riyal are not be there to be

461
00:46:35,589 --> 00:47:02,010
afraid I don't be afraid we are just
took questions we got a question but yes

462
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:23,500
you can hear it

463
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:29,670
iptables masquerade as helpful so we
took it off just save space but you can

464
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:33,690
use that to put your network instead of
the neck at and the VPN using a VPN

465
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:38,220
tools that can be helpful as well
actually have some new software coming

466
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,240
out only get ahead of myself but for
this afternoon stock will be talking

467
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,509
about them anymore project and we do
have some new models coming out which

468
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:53,380
will have built in so be a lot easier to
do that exactly there's a question yes

469
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,150
sir

470
00:47:54,150 --> 00:48:09,049
so I haven't hear they're cool I just
always start with openwork I think

471
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:12,579
there's that the tool set unopened word
is pretty good out how light is on the

472
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:16,380
tools that does bring up another comment
if you guys don't know where the FCC has

473
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:20,700
a bulletin or comment at this point
where they're going to be requiring

474
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:25,250
manufacturers to prevent us from being
able to flash your router's so if you

475
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:31,930
google for save wifi you can get
involved to send a letter to the FCC to

476
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:36,430
see that's really stupid idea we want to
be able to flash the equipment we buy so

477
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,609
beware of that as well make sure you
that's a very good point please make

478
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:56,420
sure you do that

479
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:07,550
so the question was twice what why did
we miss our house why do we selected

480
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:15,890
twice so we have to we could have done
it once yes we wanted to demonstrate how

481
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:21,080
easy it is to reflash device so we could
have built the packaged correctly the

482
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,080
first time and uploaded it via the web
interface and flashed it just once

483
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:30,270
yes I would have certainly been about
option but you have to kind of know how

484
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:33,400
to do both the first time at the rodeo
have to do the web interface that's the

485
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,600
only choice after you've done it once
you have to do it to the command line

486
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:54,880
necessarily choice yes we just like know
exactly so I really enjoy the thirty

487
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,020
forty small compact got the battery
built in the only limitation I really

488
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:04,790
find is about one USB port so if you
expand the memory through a USB Drive on

489
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:10,780
it obviously then you can't put like a
49 on it or something like that so and

490
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,480
also obviously one ethernet port but
that's never really been a problem for

491
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,230
me this guy is really nice it's actually
looks bad but it's very thin so actually

492
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:24,800
really good success to get behind things
are underneath that gap between your

493
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,600
desktop and your drawer filing cabinet
it's almost perfectly at least in our

494
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,730
office and then you can do like mental
stuff so you only have one network port

495
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:37,990
me before an IP phone or or another
machine there you can plug into here and

496
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:42,530
plug this into the wall and then
hopefully there none the wiser right so

497
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:49,830
I would highlight this little next 30
2008 got to Ethernet ports that sweet

498
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:54,620
you can like run track this if traffic
through it it's actually got eight mega

499
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,750
flashed you got twice as much less basic
actually put a few more packages on a

500
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:02,850
flash has two USB ports you can add
something

501
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:07,640
and they're like I think 19 bucks from
china ship so it's an awesome little

502
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,870
router it is great to have the time no
battery though the time to get one from

503
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:14,770
China absolutely those things are great

504
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:19,720
tp-link both both models Michael showed
you a price I believe at Microcenter

505
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,010
yeah actually think pick this one up

506
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:29,120
fries but it was a comparable model at
Target I think I went to bed in heavy

507
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:38,680
USB so I ended up getting the USB
version from frys instead in our time

508
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,580
you actually think you very much
