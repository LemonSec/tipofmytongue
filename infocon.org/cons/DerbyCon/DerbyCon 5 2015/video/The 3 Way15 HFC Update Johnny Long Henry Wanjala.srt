1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
first of all thanks for coming and
thanks for being here I know it's late

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,649
on Saturday and there's lots to do in
the next few hours so honored that you

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,139
guys are here so thanks for coming for
those of you that don't know about the

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:15,849
story I just want to tell you briefly
sort of how this whole thing started we

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:21,310
we moved to Uganda as a family almost
seven years ago

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,119
little over six years ago so we've been
there for us that was kind of a step of

7
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,250
faith we felt like that was workout was
the last to go and there were some

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,360
really cool stuff there but every time I
tell this story changes a bit because

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,079
the dynamics of working there start to
reveal different things and recently

10
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,559
what's what's been popping up has been
what it was like to work with those kids

11
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,870
that first year I focused on an awful
lot of computer stuff but really it was

12
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:58,320
about the kids and my kids are not gonna
kids but these are the Ugandan kids and

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,500
they made their at their spark plugs
they just like our full of energy you

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,990
come into the classroom you know it's
kind of embarrassing cuz when you walk

15
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,350
into a classroom is as a resume you as a
white person a visitor they stopped

16
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,450
everything and like they have to greet
you and they have to sing you a song and

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,860
it's kinda like sometimes you just gotta
let it slip in the back and like you

18
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,049
know check it out and see what's going
on you can't do that and I i I don't

19
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:27,770
think it's so much a mandate from the
teachers as it's just over time they

20
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:33,150
realize that the kids would turn around
and smile and wave at you and and laugh

21
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,369
no matter what so they're just like ok
we're just gonna go with this year gonna

22
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:41,150
get an official greeting so these kids
were these kids absolutely captured me

23
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:49,240
when I was over there and this statistic
just absolutely floored me you know 57

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,140
million children don't have access to
primary education so it's no wonder that

25
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,399
later in life

26
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,860
they're struggling it's as simple as
that so basically what we did when we

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,469
were going over there is used my you
know my tech skills and donations from

28
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:06,610
the computer

29
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,100
community and we install the computer
lab this is our first computer lab that

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:16,040
we install and you can just see the kids
reaction to this was was awesome I mean

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,590
we we didn't have many computers had
like six little laptops but the kids

32
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,610
would just be stacked trying to look at
these things and there was just real

33
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,980
excitement there and eventually what we
found out was it was kinda hard to do

34
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,700
the classroom to install computers in
classrooms one you have to have somebody

35
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,920
to maintain them which means you have to
train the teachers have to trust that

36
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,630
the stuff you put in there is getting
looked after properly properly there's

37
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,190
always the issue of security people
stealing them it's very hard to keep

38
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,290
them clean because you know they don't
have glass windows

39
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,840
you know most of the places it's very
dusty so the model that we sort of

40
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,580
focused on was the computer training
center where we take the equipment put

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,270
it into one place and then we draw
people into the center to train them and

42
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,930
that worked really well because we could
have our own people they're really

43
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,230
looking after the equipment and lots of
people could go through very few

44
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,720
machines lots of people could benefit
from that so that's the model that we

45
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,480
basically landed on so we we went
through about 3,000 students last year

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,540
and the computer training center and
that's awesome I mean you guys did that

47
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,650
through donations of equipment and and
money and that's that is absolutely huge

48
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:39,239
for us and last year I asked for $13,000
that's what it takes to keep this whole

49
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,840
thing running for a year and Derby Conn
came up with that so Derby Conn made

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,489
this happen last year

51
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:52,200
absolutely staggering also last year in
Derby Conn I introduced you to Henry

52
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,230
Henry here

53
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:05,069
and energies were gonna talk more about
Henry story but this was kind of his his

54
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,720
self-made bio as a result of being in
that training center

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,150
the training center is designed to give
people basic job skills like Word Excel

56
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,769
and stuff like that and you can see it's
there's a lot more than just Word and

57
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,860
Excel me Henry came into this place and
he just wanted to learn absolutely

58
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,630
everything that he could but those who
that's all I talked last year remember

59
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,190
some of these quotes from Henry he loves
working in the computer training center

60
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:38,300
he was working with kids but he talked
about wanting develop apps to change

61
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,560
Africa to really make a difference over
there he talked about he loves working

62
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,860
with kids he wants to teach them coding
what city some programming and he says I

63
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,389
wanted design robots and drones this is
a quote I didn't ask him any questions

64
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,139
about the drone thing that was a touchy
subject I don't want to blow stuff up or

65
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:02,889
not who doesn't right but basically what
this all pointed to this point to

66
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,900
something very different than the
computer training center this pointed to

67
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,090
a hackerspace and Henry wasn't alone as
we started getting students going

68
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,810
through the hackerspace we realize that
there are a lot of people that wanted

69
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,060
more than just a basic job entering data
they really love technology but they

70
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,690
didn't have anywhere to go

71
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,130
the largest university in Kampala
actually in most of east africa is

72
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,210
mccreary University and it is still
possible to go through that you that

73
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,990
University get a high level degree like
a master's in technology and not touch a

74
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,610
computer that is still possible you can
take tracks through that program get

75
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,720
your degree and not touch a computer so
this idea of giving people access to the

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,960
technology you have the interest is very
important so last year I basically said

77
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,740
you know I need $6,000 to rent a place
right next to the training center

78
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:01,620
hire staff Henry and one other guy pay
utilities and all that stuff and last

79
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,750
year we raised that at Derby Conn a
donor specifically came forward and said

80
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,689
you you're asking for this money for
this thing we're gonna pay

81
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:13,479
you can run hackerspace four-year so
what I'm going to talk about this year

82
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:19,459
is almost entirely focused on the
hackerspace its that's not all we do but

83
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:23,949
this year was huge for the hackerspace
and there's there's a lot to show we're

84
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:26,429
gonna get into the other stuff that we
do and I don't want you to think that

85
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:31,089
because I'm spending less time on the
other stuff it's less important but an

86
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:36,779
awful lot really happened in this past
year with the hackerspace you guys is

87
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:44,709
there asked this before do you have
audio audio cable here they're not

88
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:51,050
supply are you we we can go grab a
speaker from our booth is a call ok

89
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:59,189
alright well ok I can do this thing I'll
do this thing for right now I grabbed it

90
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:04,659
and then yeah okay so this is sorry that
I have so many videos and some of you

91
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:08,709
have seen these are really short but
showing you the videos really helps

92
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:12,179
capture the environment of Sirte what
the spaces like I think a lot better

93
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:32,020
than the photos so this first video is
the hackerspace opening

94
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:46,979
dairy so basically what you're looking
at here is this is our security cage we

95
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,639
had to build a cage inside the
hackerspace to keep most of our

96
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,650
sensitive equipment secure so this is a
solid steel cage I got this idea from a

97
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,870
bank in the area we got it locally
crafted the thing weighs about two

98
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,150
hundred and fifty pounds and most of our
gear we lock up inside they're actually

99
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:09,400
covered the whole thing with would this
is the key that opens the hackerspace

100
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,650
I decided I gotta bring some of the
scrap next year I've never seen it like

101
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:19,069
that with all that like four sides and
all that stuff is really crazy so this

102
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,520
is the this is the front door of the
hackerspace you can see there's another

103
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,080
layer of security there the entire
places caged-in that's normal for you

104
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,310
having bars on all the windows having
bars on all the doors we do not this is

105
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:37,300
the street entrance we do not use this
basically we court weaker and off the

106
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,700
whole front wall and students actually
have to get in from the back we don't

107
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,579
want people walking into our hackerspace
off the street and going who what's this

108
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:49,790
look at all the shiny stuff this is
basically for invitation only are for

109
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,610
students that came through the show an
aptitude as you can see it's a it's a

110
00:08:53,610 --> 00:09:00,329
really nice open space this back door on
the other side of this wall is the

111
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:05,770
computer training center the CTC this is
a mirror image of that and in the CDC

112
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,790
that's a bathroom and when I rented the
place I didn't even think about checking

113
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,300
to make sure that the bathroom was in
there I just assumed it was a mirror

114
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,000
image he was a safe is it was a
microfinance company they left their

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,410
safe behind it was kind of funny because
when we got in there and opened it up we

116
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:28,540
found that there was another safe inside
the safe he was there was the most

117
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:35,029
ridiculous thing so I don't i still dont
wanna know what's in that same guy good

118
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:45,100
to go

119
00:09:45,100 --> 00:10:13,240
absolutely loved was to make it really
fun so you know especially for kids that

120
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,190
come in here so course the sliding
chairs were great idea

121
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,430
the bouncy chairs not only keep you
awake can you know help engage your core

122
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,210
which is kinda cool but we found that
they were just really maneuverable we

123
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,120
can move around in these were just made
a truck springs so I saw one in a local

124
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,680
shop and somebody had used an old trucks
bring him in a chair out of it and I was

125
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,730
like ok about Super Kool we we totally
gotta use that so those are some of the

126
00:10:37,730 --> 00:11:12,050
chairs here

127
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:49,930
ok those are my kids by the way one of
the themes that you're gonna see as I go

128
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,649
through here is that my kids and my
family involved a lot in this process

129
00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:00,810
well we're the only ones you know so we
do an awful lot this is my son Declan

130
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:07,610
working on a VESA mount for Raspberry Pi
we've got lots of equipment donated it

131
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:13,760
really didn't fit in the CTC I mean we
had basic programs that we were doing

132
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,600
over there so one of the things that we
had to do is really had to start

133
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,300
cataloging all of this stuff barcode
system and an engraver

134
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,720
put on there because this is just the
deterrent but we found it really works

135
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,860
engraving Electronics is a really big
tits hard to keep people from stealing

136
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,670
they get access to it so basically
everything had to be engraved and we

137
00:12:39,670 --> 00:13:07,730
also got a display case where

138
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:18,420
now once we started getting things and
places are there are starting to come

139
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:23,730
into the security cages there are
starting to get things marks a very slow

140
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,410
process but we're just about to open and
temperatures in Jinja spike it was it

141
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,490
was summer temperatures started getting
above 100 degrees and what things I

142
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,130
wanted to the hackers basis I wanted to
be close and that's primarily because of

143
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:43,839
the DAS if you have windows open to get
across paris' you just get Dawson this

144
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,160
is the inside this picture on the bottom
is inside of one of our servers are guys

145
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,540
do a pretty decent job but stay on top
of it you know so we wanted to

146
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,820
hackerspace to be completely closed up
alone we close the doors in there it was

147
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,490
upwards of a hundred and twenty degrees
put a fan in there and you know it's

148
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,810
just you're blowing so you're in there
for like three minutes and you're like

149
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:15,079
tapping out here so I hadn't planned on
that I hadn't budgeted for it there be

150
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:21,190
so basically when you know I put it to
eat out and I was like we need $2000 for

151
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:27,060
air conditioning is no way around it and
came forward and got us an air

152
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,800
conditioner which was really pretty
amazing that is a theme that just

153
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,940
happening this a lot of stuff that I'm
doing I have no clue what I'm doing I'm

154
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,120
like ok we're gonna do this thing and
then we started using it doesn't work

155
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,130
and need something else and I get a
little bit worried that people are just

156
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,170
like many just keeps asking for stuff

157
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,519
the truth is that the community just
steps up every time and they're like

158
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,430
yeah absolutely we're gonna help you and
that makes me incredibly proud because

159
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:02,060
what's happened now this year's we have
a hackerspace in Uganda it's finally

160
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,160
come full circle and now it's you know
stuff that hackers are excited about

161
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,079
going on in Uganda you guys made that
happen so one of the one of the next

162
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,769
things that we wanted to do on that
first classes that we want to do is

163
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:17,740
starting to teach robotics because there
were no existing robotics program

164
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,390
that all in the entire country and the
robotics system setup started with this

165
00:15:23,390 --> 00:16:00,980
little guy called medicine so we're
really happy with the kids are excited

166
00:16:00,980 --> 00:17:02,740
and so

167
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,890
when you buy more than one of these
things are possible by the stem software

168
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,660
which is licensed from Lego you know
basically just gets expensive really

169
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,589
fast this guy was a Kickstarter from a
guy Australian basically solve that

170
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:33,540
problem and was like not designed by
later compatible its Mindstorms ready to

171
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:45,679
come out so I felt pretty pretty good
that we were able to actually give you

172
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,929
know and we gotta see you basically
start with bar codes and run him over a

173
00:17:50,929 --> 00:18:04,000
bar code so the first day of robotics to
drag and drop interface that lets you

174
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:13,520
know Denison scratch so that was so this
this is what we spent most of our time I

175
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:28,890
last year that hackers based on my
family so that's because it happens when

176
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:39,970
hackers descend on a project one thing
that really happen and the first the

177
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:46,370
first person to shopping so you guys
might know cleo

178
00:18:46,370 --> 00:19:00,630
the audio I Emraan override the speaker
foley ok well that's like a snapshot of

179
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,550
what I'm I'll be up here trying to do
this one thing and it's just the snails

180
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:12,309
try to try to do a little bit of
everything that I have lockers come in

181
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:20,780
and work to make that happen over and
over and over

182
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:35,950
right okay and 0 engine is just like I
did not argue that all we got so many

183
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:40,679
crazy things he came to the key police
at down and he's like why is your

184
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:49,000
internet so discussion about why I could
make the internet faster now it doesn't

185
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,560
work

186
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:07,560
and she came up with this like solution
that like sped up our internet what's

187
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,050
next you know I always sit in the living
room school at the laptop try to upgrade

188
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:31,420
the memory and doing things like that
we're just really got things moving so

189
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:41,590
while he was there in nineteen

190
00:20:41,590 --> 00:21:11,690
beheading one thing that so he's the
nicest places like ok this you do get

191
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:23,799
your drivers like to go on the party
really told you count on that so on

192
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:39,059
safari shows with with the wild animal
spent some time in our leather shop that

193
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:59,470
is a funny face for his journals
realized we spent a lot of time with

194
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:10,899
henry was actually there and Rihanna
officially so work and so basically to

195
00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:17,280
me and I became

196
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:34,460
and it wasn't just me i mean even the
staff and got the ball rolling after

197
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:41,350
Coolio came this guy Greg came and
worked with Sparkfun for many years so

198
00:22:41,350 --> 00:23:00,090
he came over so it's all about scratch
yeah what was it

199
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,670
ok so that was really cool

200
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:08,890
gave us you believe those things and
then Jason can't came over and he

201
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:26,240
basically is also the visa yet this I
brought this out of writers $100 power

202
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,550
you know this was the first thing we
made was a pair of sandals I was like

203
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:39,320
another another story were like dude I
don't know how did you assemble we're

204
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,130
going to figure this out just sat down

205
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:52,990
tracing is we did not you made up so you
really have to solve the letter for him

206
00:23:52,990 --> 00:24:10,760
but he also came over and also hopes up
there and configured it and also so at

207
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,140
this point

208
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:24,170
so that was that was really a friend of
ours has nothing to do with Packers

209
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:40,120
relatively technical person reads like
the Renaissance Festival you know our

210
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,180
restaurant we had a whole party
everybody again no agenda just wanna

211
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:52,410
comment on what you know and it was
awesome he keeps going well came over

212
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:57,910
we're getting fairly recently at this
came over and again another example of

213
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:05,300
how I don't really have an agenda but i
wanna be made him you this once we have

214
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:13,110
the hackers like guys like oh stop the
hacker community donated a 3d printer

215
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:24,540
maker too so you know this was at this
time this was the first any places like

216
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:31,580
we could even see them let alone touch
them

217
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:38,020
Brandon Brandon came over right around
this time also in fact belts and Brandon

218
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:48,710
were both at the same time in a good way
you know it's it's it's cool for me how

219
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:55,810
one hacker they're having to there was a
slight this resident amplification going

220
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:00,250
absolutely crazy and it really change
the environment we got a little bit

221
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,370
nerdy

222
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:10,230
separately they brought a bunch of
raspberry PI's security donated a bunch

223
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:18,590
of other robotics as well and his family
was just absolutely awesome a lot of fun

224
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:23,270
with them and then friends of ours to
him and whiting Joanna came over in

225
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:29,350
January and they wanted to basically
interview are stopped and that was

226
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,490
something that you wanted to do as well
as basically be able to tell what's

227
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:38,550
going on there another so that was
really cool

228
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,380
last but not least last year more people
out these two ladies came over from

229
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:51,980
Canada absolutely no agenda at all in
Uganda just wanted to come over here and

230
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,800
talk a little bit more about that and
then the sponsors of the hackers based

231
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:04,600
the wives of the company decided to call
it a girls trip hackers showed up really

232
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,630
really pretty pretty amazing so because
of all that happening things now started

233
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,179
happening very quickly we start we had
more equipment we started playing around

234
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:20,880
with make it robotics kits and make box
kits we started doing Raspberry Pi

235
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:28,150
screening starts with a close last has
so now we've got Linux robots we've got

236
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:34,650
three greeting I mean really cool stuff
happening at this point this is a little

237
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:39,940
video this is the kind of the unboxing
setup was a lot of fun it was pretty

238
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,510
straightforward instructions that came
with the automaker were super easy to

239
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,740
follow

240
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:52,460
we didn't really have too many problems
as we set things up we took our time are

241
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,570
super careful with everything we did so
obviously it's hard for us to get spare

242
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:03,320
parts and things like that so we we
didn't break anything we spent a lot of

243
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,850
time reading the instructions

244
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,730
and then we get excited about starting

245
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:14,030
shed and and then go back to the
instructions and so we had a lot of

246
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:20,679
heart ailments but man without light
came on and the box just load it was

247
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,830
just the coolest thing you'll see a lot
of these shots are spending an awful lot

248
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:31,640
of time like looking at this thing just
absolute and we got to the point where

249
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,640
one spot in the setup we just kind of
stopped with his glowing box and just

250
00:28:38,640 --> 00:29:45,020
totally down

251
00:29:45,020 --> 00:31:00,690
unboxing video that shows one of the
street so the other thing that we had

252
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,620
was we got little bit brought over and
the little bits we went to a highly

253
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:44,410
scientific testing of these devices

254
00:31:44,410 --> 00:32:00,970
week we spent a solid three hours and
testing that's what we did we did

255
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:10,510
actually your ID actually education of
children with little bit but these are

256
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:45,340
as we start working with our kids of
this point it's the sanctuary ginger

257
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:55,840
collection so we were excited to do our
class for former street kids their

258
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:03,950
response was really really enjoy having
the kids and they really had their faces

259
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:09,110
just lit up when they started playing

260
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:51,260
frederick Motz to a lot of them they
understood what results were you know it

261
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:57,290
was kind of magic this invisible light
and actually see action was really fun

262
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:02,919
for the kids and a lot of the sensor its
which one is the sensor and where's your

263
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:12,179
output that was exciting for me because
they actually understood the Turks and

264
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:24,919
our kids also got a chance of player on
the space kid around excited about this

265
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:29,590
this class it's just jump right in

266
00:34:29,590 --> 00:35:46,589
how kids are so hard

267
00:35:46,589 --> 00:36:53,559
never ever get within three weeks we
have the national robotics different

268
00:36:53,559 --> 00:42:39,390
stations that we set up to really care
about excuse the language

269
00:42:39,390 --> 00:43:26,700
now one thing I want to do is like to
bring up short while

270
00:43:26,700 --> 00:44:05,050
Dave n they are the community for having
me you guys are treated me so everybody

271
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:19,099
that counts to me you know thank you so
much thank you I was interested in light

272
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:29,040
hiking no idea how everything works so I
tried to make this very brief but one

273
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,460
time I was we call it the main street is
like a high winds and ISO journeys and

274
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:44,859
it had had cancer charity so that raised
questions this this is an easy they

275
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:51,560
started doing a stage in my Google
everything about him they read a lot

276
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:56,740
about him and then I tried so magistrate
friend he's drunk again

277
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:04,060
friend that's it how's your charity so
one day more coming out of a restaurant

278
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,809
it's on Main Street

279
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:14,420
and I i saw the car so I waited I stand
along this street waiting until you know

280
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:35,039
the owner know he found out he was
living with his family yet just finished

281
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:42,229
I think and I went to him as he was
during the ezine and I'm like I need to

282
00:45:42,229 --> 00:45:56,890
talk to you how he showed me his face
like surprised by Henry and I read about

283
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:02,910
you and thought about you know I'd like
to how you know how would I Jane hackers

284
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:12,900
richard was really busy right now i cant
talk during now but he gave me his

285
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:20,549
business card here you know keeping
damage as I think send him an email made

286
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:28,219
what can I do how can I hope you you
know charities yes indeed and I read a

287
00:46:28,219 --> 00:47:03,390
lot about you would like to learn a lot
from you and see how I can get involved

288
00:47:03,390 --> 00:48:06,869
and uses the word work but really what r
three budgets being what they are and

289
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:11,130
everything not having a lot of money and
things only starting I spent 34 years of

290
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:34,230
his life and that's part of the reason
they just came to me and you're like so

291
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:39,980
I worked with Canadians

292
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:45,060
I used to volunteer in another
organization called give international

293
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:53,280
so I had made one of them before so they
sort of knew I was into computers but

294
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,890
when they came this time they were doing
something different so they just run it

295
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:03,859
an update on what I was doing and what
was going on so they may come down to

296
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:08,930
someone brought them to the hospice and
when they came they were shocked and

297
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:13,380
surprised about why was in there and
everything going on I give them the full

298
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,810
story of what we're doing and what we
intend on doing and they like and we

299
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:24,340
hope and I what can we do I told them
about everybody that we're doing and

300
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:30,270
training and at that point way we had
not reached that level that you saw but

301
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:36,359
he said ok so one of them is a robotics
teacher is involved in robotics in

302
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:41,760
Canada so she was like ok let's see how
we can link these you know the Ugandan

303
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,400
kids and the Canadian deeds and we get
them to do it challenged sort of show

304
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,780
and line and so we had to prepare every
evening we had to come in and do a lot

305
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:59,190
of work and prepare things and make sure
that everything happened as Jenna showed

306
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:04,510
why they're easy having to do all of
that stuff in one man had to do work

307
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:15,880
like stay up late and make it happen so
that's how to get there

308
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:37,589
talk about other projects that we've
been working on you guys know that we've

309
00:50:37,589 --> 00:51:00,279
been working with raspberry PI's in
there is broken we just can't afford

310
00:51:00,279 --> 00:51:07,089
that and it's it doesn't work he works
with other organizations pockets so what

311
00:51:07,089 --> 00:51:11,529
we needed a compromise how to get more
people change how do we find the kids

312
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:18,220
that are in the school's robotics for
example find them yet

313
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:24,619
Center go through the center and they
going to work and what we do is we

314
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:30,710
basically used the raspberry PI's as a
very small access content in schools

315
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:38,390
library now get box katha me like you
get all the stuff is great for school by

316
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:46,410
also get computer training material
about you know PowerPoint Word and all

317
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:52,059
that stuff always stop basically starts
to bubble up that have an interest in

318
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:57,109
following backtrack that eventually can
make their way into the trains actually

319
00:51:57,109 --> 00:52:11,660
act on that so it's very lightweight way
to help you know this project has been

320
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:16,839
very my heart because it really does
help us expand very quickly and help and

321
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:22,099
awful lot of people so damned if you
wanna come up and talk a little bit

322
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:26,910
about some of the evolution and where we
are in my hands

323
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:38,119
the work we've been doing with the
rugged pyres we called it the education

324
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:41,650
page and agency website talks a lot
about you guys understand that he just

325
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,150
briefly talked about the educational
software that was on it

326
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:50,569
one thing we found now once we start
deploying a dozen around the world is

327
00:52:50,569 --> 00:52:54,809
that they're not really long-term
reliable I guess you could say so

328
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:58,849
they're great maker project but when you
put in the hands of somebody who can't

329
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:03,460
really kicks in when a wire comes loose
and then they have to call Johnny and

330
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,969
johnny has a drive two hours and then he
has to walk for 15 20 30 minutes an hour

331
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:14,160
and then take a bus to just a fix a
loose wire becomes very burned some in

332
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,400
some ways right because he can't just do
this for all the different projects

333
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,479
throughout the world so we tried to in
the last couple years

334
00:53:21,479 --> 00:53:26,599
partnering possible another organization
that was the impetus for the Rachel

335
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:30,839
software that we do that we utilize
heavily now is that we want a project

336
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:34,309
that would be reliable and robust and
something that could be user field

337
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:39,719
serviceable through contact with
intelligent haitian armed we came up

338
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:45,619
with the content access content access
point is the new rugged pie it's not as

339
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:49,369
rugged yet we're still working with the
actual manufacturer to make it more

340
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:55,130
rugged dust and water resistant and
what's nice about it is it's 500 gig

341
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:56,969
hard drive so it

342
00:53:56,969 --> 00:54:02,119
quadruples if not five times the
capacity of our current storage space

343
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:07,269
Gigabit Ethernet USB 3.0 will talk about
his second and it's got a six hour

344
00:54:07,269 --> 00:54:10,469
battery so we lose a little better
battery life original one had about 24

345
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:15,049
but we found was that's plenty of time
for a school in an environment where the

346
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:18,549
student the teacher can actually teach
from it without having any access to

347
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:21,920
power and then you can take it home in
charge tonight where they usually have

348
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,789
reliable power the USB is kind of
interesting because she'll

349
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:29,780
serviceability was one of those issues
so what's nice about it in person

350
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:35,120
is given a USB when they buy account the
USB has on the recovery image not all

351
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,110
the data that's on their educational
data but actually there's software the

352
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:43,570
source OS a plugin the USB they turn it
on it recovers the whole device memory

353
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:47,880
flashing it back to factory defaults so
they screw something up or something

354
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,770
happens the device they can reset back
to factory with no problem all their

355
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:56,970
data still there is back to normal and
that's it that's as easy as it gets its

356
00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:00,620
one piece as well whereas the original
pi had four different circuit boards of

357
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,360
the new ones one right and the new one
also has a two and a half inch drive

358
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,400
which can be easily replaced with solid
state or something more

359
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:14,470
it's easy to see from deployment
deployments perspective that it's this

360
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:18,640
type of thing makes sense overseas but
we never found a good way to handle in

361
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,310
the states on top of that we had an
issue with large donors or even small

362
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:29,830
donors he said had 10 laptops 500
laptops I'd like to donate to you and

363
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:34,780
for us it made sense originally because
we like how you receive and then the

364
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:39,520
first time we did that customs and
duties behind her bank account down and

365
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,160
we almost aside least up there because
it didn't make sense it was so expensive

366
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:49,110
to push it over there and she took a lot
of manpower so what we did in his girl I

367
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:53,730
guess the last three years I said no and
we we we struggle with that we want to

368
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,440
find a solution that made sense

369
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:01,900
states with organizations that can
really could use it but we didn't know

370
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,430
how bad it and that was another issue
the volunteer network with our attempt

371
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,560
to try to do that a couple years ago

372
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:15,950
last year we had an opportunity to work
with a shelter the

373
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:24,450
shelter is downtown Louisville it
focuses on abusive situations so it it

374
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:29,280
takes in folks who are in abusive
situations and tries to help them

375
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,900
protect them provide them service and
support either treated as clients and

376
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:39,650
it's a really great program what we did
for them was we did train the trainer we

377
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:45,050
tried to we didn't want to talk to the
client so much because we didn't feel

378
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:48,589
like we're experienced and ready to do
that we don't have training in that

379
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:52,770
field that made sense to us though as we
can teach cybersecurity we can teach

380
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:57,170
cyber safety we can talk to the actual
trainers and the call center folks our

381
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:00,900
staff and help them understand
techniques that they can pass on to the

382
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,520
clients and then the clients can
actually use to help themselves protect

383
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,540
themselves from that abusive person and
that worked really well as a great

384
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,680
course we had a lot of volunteers from
HSC and from you guys that came over

385
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,940
whether they're with us and then there's
play to 10 folks this year we tried

386
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:25,300
something different we wanted to capture
the moment of how do we incorporate

387
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,980
hardware and what you see here at the
hotel Louisville sounds benign but it's

388
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:34,930
amazing project this hotel is fully
staffed by a homeless or previously

389
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:39,579
homeless folks multiple floors you can
go and actually stayed there for

390
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:43,220
relatively cheap as well if you want to
stay there floors designated for regular

391
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:47,060
folks to come and stay and their floors
designated for folks are going through

392
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:51,930
drug and alcohol rehab family homeless
folks family whether it's homeless

393
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:56,900
person or their families can come stay
there you can get real education as long

394
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:01,040
as you're fully the work with you to
call grants for free you can stay in

395
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,990
hotel for free you can eat there for
free you volunteer 16 hours a week we

396
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:09,990
felt it was a great project very
inspiring project but how can we benefit

397
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:13,490
them they are to have relationships with
University of Louisville as well as

398
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,900
other 13 colleges in Louisville area
like okay so what else do you have we

399
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,180
have internet cafe and a castes handle
by University of Louisville

400
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,470
ok well that's cool

401
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:30,010
guess we can help their so what can we
do next and they said well a big part of

402
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,500
the problem after we talked about their
needs were i don't i don't have a

403
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:40,340
solution for education I don't have a
way to help these folks get a job except

404
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,820
for talking to them and helping them
right to resume

405
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:48,609
well we have resume software we have
software on the actual computer the

406
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:52,570
goodwill foundation so that I talked
about that shows you how to take in how

407
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:59,020
to sit in an interview how to write the
the actual resume that makes sense for

408
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:03,770
folks that are looking to hire you how
did you do the basic job skills like how

409
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:06,510
to use Microsoft Word how to use a
computer

410
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:10,190
one guy we talked to two days ago

411
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:15,099
name is Rob he said that he almost
committed suicide because he couldn't

412
00:59:15,099 --> 00:59:19,349
even apply for a job at Walmart because
he had no idea what a computer worked

413
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:23,190
and walmart has online applications now
you have to sit in front of computer

414
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:27,490
news of Jesus I don't know how to use it
I don't know what I'm doing and he's

415
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:32,040
working there now going through programs
that try to help him with that with his

416
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:37,040
other issues but he wants to get a job
he wants to work how do you do that and

417
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:43,160
so what we're doing now is we gave them
yesterday content access point a fully

418
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,990
loaded this one actually broadcasting
right now if you want to check out the

419
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:51,589
software that's on it each of SeaTac
Rachel it is two hundred and twenty gigs

420
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:56,910
worth of content all of Khan Academy all
of Wikipedia as of July of this year

421
00:59:56,910 --> 01:00:01,820
goodwill foundation content basic job
skills CK 12 Foundation which is K

422
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:06,339
through twelve great text books with
manuals the Edison content that we teach

423
01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:09,750
from the robotics stuff is all the all
the lesson plans all the worksheets are

424
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:14,040
on there it goes on and on and on and
this is where we're going with it so we

425
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:18,099
said ok that's awesome now we can
provide them with this and laptops which

426
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:23,849
provides a way forward for these type of
organizations well how do you further we

427
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:28,430
talked about his laptop donations that
people want to give us what we do

428
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:33,030
the next step was well let's try because
we know we're not really keen on how to

429
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:37,540
weave let's give the actual organization
the mission the laptops

430
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:41,430
let them given to these folks when they
start the job skills training program

431
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:44,850
which is a six-month long program they
get to use the laptop while they're

432
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:49,730
there and then if they graduate which
the mission decides how they graduate

433
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:53,780
they get to keep the laptop they gain
benefit they gain usefulness they

434
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:57,770
probably won't comment at this time
because it shows itself to be something

435
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:03,030
they can use and that's where out that's
where we want to go did you want to talk

436
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:10,090
about the direction following all this
so basically what we're looking to do is

437
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:15,870
start up regional groups within the USSR
all over the world where we can finally

438
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:21,970
use volunteers to do hoc projects nice
hoc projects because we want to use the

439
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,750
resources that we have as a community
just help you do what you're gonna do

440
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:29,450
but the ideas if there's something in
your area and you see a place that's

441
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:33,570
doing good work they need some help you
basically can just send an email and say

442
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:36,830
well I'd like the thing I like to help
this group of what we want to do is we

443
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:40,600
just try to get equipment to you just
put it it's going to be very simple in

444
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,810
the beginning we're just going to tweet

445
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:47,540
hey anybody can get laptops to this area
and we're gonna try to find some

446
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:51,200
regional coordinators eventually that
can say hey I'll stand up and I'll be

447
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,110
the person in Louisville that can you
know be a central point to do these

448
01:01:55,110 --> 01:02:00,170
types of projects so basically gives us
a way to use laptops and hardware like

449
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:05,020
that maybe networking stuff eventually
it gives us a way to let volunteers get

450
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:10,000
involved to do work and also to use our
experience and job skills training and

451
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,770
you know helping schools and all of that
and bring it all together so that people

452
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:18,070
can get involved directly where they are
we try to do it hot and heavy with the

453
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:22,000
volunteer network before and the
software was too complex

454
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,250
this is a lot simpler we don't need a
regional coordinator in a way about you

455
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,100
know that'll help eventually so if
you're interested in that that's the

456
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:33,860
direction that we're going so we have a
way to use equipment we have

457
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,650
opportunities for volunteers especially
in the USA and basically a chance to

458
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:41,000
help local charities in need very simply
especially with all this old gear that

459
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:48,600
you guys how now enclosing were we we
have to reboot again

460
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,290
because last year we got the training
center funded and we got the hackerspace

461
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:56,500
funded and it was funded for a year so
we're still we're still very much

462
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,490
looking for corporate donors to help us
pay for those

463
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:04,160
the paper goes to great places and this
is basically the price tag this this is

464
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:10,190
everything so $13,000 for the operation
CTC remember going around 3,000 students

465
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:15,880
a year we can probably do more than that
and $6,000 to run the hackerspace

466
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:21,200
four-year that's basically what we need
I'm actually over time

467
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:27,070
here's the here's the links that we have
we're we're absolutely thrilled with

468
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:30,450
what's happened it there because it's
been absolutely magic you guys have made

469
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:33,520
some amazing things all this stuff
that's happening is because the year

470
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:38,500
when you buy a t-shirt or donated
equipment are actually came over you

471
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:43,360
know all of that is is because of what
you guys have done so I'm incredibly

472
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:48,760
thankful and blessed you guys and last
but not least Khalil Khalil had been

473
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:54,610
talking about his trip an awful lot and
some of you read his blog this this

474
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:58,260
quote really hit me about coming to
Uganda if you're thinking about it he

475
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,620
says if at this point you're thinking
what can I do let me tell you come to

476
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:05,660
Uganda why because johnnie said in his
latest blog post just being around

477
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:08,550
hackers help them stay in touch with the
hacker point of view

478
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:12,310
just discussing problems with other
hackers becomes part of the solution you

479
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:16,870
will love it here then finally it can be
a family vacation a soul rejuvenating

480
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:21,360
trip a life-changing experience for all
of it once we still have a need for

481
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:26,400
folks in Uganda where we live in a great
vacation destination and it amplifies

482
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,150
all the work that we do so if you're
thinking about it obviously please just

483
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:34,600
let us now but again thank you guys so
much about over hearts we have the

484

485
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:41,860

486
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:45,110

487
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:48,450
