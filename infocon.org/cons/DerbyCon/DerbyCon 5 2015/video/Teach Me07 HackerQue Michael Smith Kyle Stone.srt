20
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:40,950
re-try credit card selfies on Twitter
that's kind of what I'm known for people

21
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,980

22
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:55,250
red team go right you can find me on
Twitter at sign as AV so what's the

23
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:04,359
smoke some meat by the likes to eat
barbecue in general it's good to hear so

24
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:08,540
everybody loves so there's a very
unscientific poll that says everyone

25
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:15,079
loves smoked meat and arrester
vegetarians don't hear very unscientific

26
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,220
history of blood starts out with chewing
food which the preservation of food

27
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,940
flavoring that reduces moisture content
this be going back to caveman

28
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,470
ages so people in there you know came in
their caves or wherever stereotype

29
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,530
drawings that they would have cooked
meat over an open fire were able to

30
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:41,910
preserve it and be able to enjoy smoking
of meat cooks so smoking as a couple of

31
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,570
different characteristics we have slow
very slow cooking on the grill the steak

32
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:53,050
it's called fast very fast very quickly
and solely on the cleans usually for

33
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,470
around 15 minutes maybe 20 minutes it
slow cooking with local designers you

34
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,120
it's designed to tenderize the meat BBQ
usually takes a lot of very tough cuts

35
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,680
things like brisket ribs and by west by
a slow cooking them making them more

36
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,710
tender for example the fibers that are
inside help destroy bacteria in to help

37
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,160
seal the other skin those who have seen
that makes crusty stuff on top of BBQ

38
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:28,300
tasty as we all of its called park today
we're going to talk about what's called

39
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,960
southern BBQ this is what most you're
familiar with me here the terms barbecue

40
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:39,390
BBQ can predates the colonial period
pre-civil so in the colonial period

41
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,900
basically had similar 10 pics I came
over with the Spanish explorers what

42
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:51,910
they would do down the south east those
pigs and then got hungry hunter pigs and

43
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,740
do a big one cook be used to be a
neighborhood park see it wasn't just you

44
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,470
could be in your backyard you get
everyone around you and your neighbors

45
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:07,580
and friends during the Civil War it
involved with you end up getting welfare

46
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,590
Hawks so we're having these seem like
feral pigs to now having kept on the

47
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,690
farms they were well fed the end up on
grain and you know what that tastes good

48
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,169
neighborhood parks now it was
interesting this time period is that the

49
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:25,129
rich people

50
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:29,239
basically live what was called high on
those who heard the term this work comes

51
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:36,149
from the hardcover higher-up tender ones
in the hips on the inside the poor folk

52
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:41,189
enslaved well they were given to talk
cuts they were given things like the way

53
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:47,610
they were giving things like jails are
things like the test is cracked and so

54
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,689
they had developed systems are ways in
order to cook those to actually make the

55
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:57,559
method and that's where smoking eating
BBQ originally from So post-civil war

56
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:01,899
when slaves later been cooking this way
purple sharecroppers and cooking this

57
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:07,029
way sorry migrating out of the south and
the insured opening BBQ stands it would

58
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:12,800
sell barbecue on the weekends and
farmworker other things to the forensic

59
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,439
center as time went by the screech
slaves and sharecropper start heading

60
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,329
north and west so that's why we go from
South we're pushing Memphis Marc

61
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:25,889
airliner known for their BBQ other
places like Kansas City where we had a

62
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,909
much more with parole at the time which
would roll point of view when it came to

63
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:39,139
slaves are slaves to a BBQ restaurant
story to open up the late 1800's and

64
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,969
early nineteen hundreds and nowadays we
did you enjoy all those tasty barbecue

65
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:50,679
restaurants so this appears about a list
of about thirteen states some loss

66
00:07:50,679 --> 00:08:01,209
include arkansas you know I'm considered
the BBQ belts so easy to stage will miss

67
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:06,389
most influence BBQ barbecue restaurants
regardless of what the are have some

68
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,919
kind of influence from here it's not
only the main regions but it's also

69
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,449
highly regional but also a little minor
meetings as well

70
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:17,059
places like Kentucky in places like
Alabama

71
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:18,169
my new environment

72
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:30,129
state ever so we talk about southern BBQ
we have four real main styles hairstyles

73
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:34,849
Carolina stocks whose from the carolinas
when you're busy BBQ and Caroline's

74
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,269
alright so once characterized you make
no Carolina's most part you can get

75
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:45,540
there is generally pulled pork sliced
pork sandwiches biggest the sausage

76
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,750
you'll have a generally a vinegar based
sauce Western North Carolina you tend to

77
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,430
go with the pork shoulder and he's a
good actor Sasa has some to meet with

78
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,630
Saudi very very very very very thin but
a bunch made a sauce usually they're

79
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,199
usually catch up and some pepper Eastern
Carolina eastern North Carolina however

80
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:04,699
does the whole

81
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:09,639
take the entire pig they all slices
chopped it all together and ensure that

82
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:13,000
everything takes to get most people
think that they could use more sweeter

83
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,250
flavor mixing in the tender what's in
the hands along with Shane Schoeller

84
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,570
success

85
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,730
Eastern Carolina also uses it in vinegar
cells so it's it's clear it's crystal

86
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,810
clear talk a little bit pepper and there
you can very easily yourself some

87
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,430
vinegar take some pepper red pepper
flakes shake it up there you go again

88
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,019
Carolina and put that on their
sandwiches at my favorite of that area

89
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,420
of central South Carolina and they do
shoulders generally Sunday whole dog

90
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,480
what they're known for that
mustard-based sauce called my favorite

91
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,060
it's actually my favorite sauces period
out there I tend to prefer that gives

92
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,040
the two me to muster support and they
say to it very tasty if you haven't

93
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:05,350
tried to I would highly suggest it's
also better for people with

94
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,130
sugar problems going paleo that steel
actually your Carolina sauces are the

95
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:18,820
ones to go with you going very well
sugar in them or Kido so let me go two

96
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,820
men who said ribs in Memphis and one
good stuff going to Memphis where my

97
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,060
favorite cities for barbecue for members
is known for wet and dry ribs in shock

98
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,540
when lives are serving the sauce on them

99
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,100
been based in most you're probably
familiar with my trips outside a better

100
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,720
you get what you usually get me to go to
trial however traditional are the more

101
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,030
unique finger Memphis so have you tried
rapes is they get the records out a

102
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,130
little bit of vinegar that putting on
there to take the rubber put it on the

103
00:10:53,130 --> 00:11:00,400
web service that you can add to it if
you want to buy usually those Europe

104
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:10,830
into the rendezvous in this that's good
example of drugs and such a report they

105
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,360
basically you sporkin everything in the
US ports stuff like sandwiches but then

106
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,410
some unique things with my favorite is
that picture on the next to the richest

107
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,780
so it's played so used to getting
noodles with pork on top of these

108
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:32,040
barbecue sauce on their interstate BBQ
fantastic Texas Texas is all about the

109
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,680
beach

110
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,740
Texas BBQ Central Texas BBQ most of
Texas the BBQ styles about five

111
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,290
different distinct styles for them are
very similar to the other areas the

112
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,540
unique one of Central Texas Central
Texas is places like Boston Lubbock

113
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,100
Kreutz markets

114
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,950
Franklin barbecue places like that a
certain very meat market stocks

115
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,089
generally what are pushed the service
planners

116
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,140
usually instant respect you come across
as you order by the pound pound pound

117
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:09,810
will take four pounds and you'll enjoy
the officer subsidy risking does seem to

118
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,990
be the main attractions in Texas the
other big thing in Texas they really

119
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,390
abuse it's there you can use in Texas
not known for music sauce is generally

120
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:30,089
used to me again that's the way it
finally Kansas City Kansas City BBQ

121
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,620
thing I can to city we have the sweet
and spicy sauce

122
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,650
most of them they cook Muslim leads in
their reason why is Kansas City was very

123
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,320
popular place for me she had all kinds
of meats going through their Cal pork

124
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,520
chicken etc

125
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,490
went through there and they cooked
everything perchance are one of the big

126
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:54,120
things known for kansas city of those
across the front element of risk it

127
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,140
chop them to use chopped off giving way
to customers and they realized well

128
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,230
these are really good

129
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,950
Selby's and now the self big big bucks
sometimes bigger than some of the other

130
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:12,000
ones and then the regional styles we
have Alabama white sauce album white

131
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,570
sauce ever been to get Bob Gibson's in
Alabama

132
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:23,329
Big Bob Gibson basically created does
pull jacket and with Gibson's what the

133
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:28,160
legend has it is there's a customer came
in didn't like to me so we ask bob with

134
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,899
up the sauce for him to meet us

135
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,610
so Bob took many a BBQ sauce over the
mail and it goes on the chicken and if

136
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:42,019
you're from Alabama Alabama and you just
have some BBQ sauce their eyes light up

137
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,509
your BBQ fan and that's that's what they
did to them is BBQ it's really good if

138
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:53,249
you have a highly recommend a Kentucky
so Kentucky has western and southwestern

139
00:13:53,249 --> 00:14:00,110
Kentucky football black size 11 really
famous for it is doesn't much so that

140
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:06,410
cooking smoke mutton and have special
sauce goes on that and you know no

141
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,470
matter how to make it up there someday
but I heard very good things

142
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:19,779
Southern California so some california
tried to throw in some kind of something

143
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:25,529
so the carolinas usually San Diego area
that's really made a certain what are

144
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:30,209
called seen the movie the scenery grill
is basically it's a live fire that has a

145
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:38,240
great view all the great up-and-down to
see them so they do say could try to be

146
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,449
smoking over there for a few hours
usually about an hour and a half to two

147
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:46,269
hours and then traditionally slices up
in a served on a sandwich or garlic

148
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:48,980
bread but you can do in multiple ways
fantastic

149
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,629
excitation fantastic next day as well
when when the BBQ meats I think taste

150
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:58,420
just as good the next days does fresh so
I highly recommend that those you been

151
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,749
to Hawaii and into a blowout so the
tradition of putting picking the pitch

152
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:08,629
calls in the stomach Stephen cooking the
pic that way that's a former BBQ as well

153
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:13,660
and in st. Louis says known for spirit
so you go to restaurants are probably

154
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:20,079
used to baby back ribs small runs spare
ribs are generally a little but the

155
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,309
oxygen to be bigger and they can have
much more sleep so there's you have

156
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:28,819
signaled his ribs or spare ribs that's
what we're talking about here

157
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:35,579
so when it comes to smoking we talk
about choosing our weapon choose your

158
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,989
weapon is talking about picking our
smoke as you can see there's a lot of

159
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:43,629
smokers out there for me personally when
I like to cook with is that first one on

160
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:49,799
the list of silver box that's true but
you know we call the smoke of burning

161
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,939
smoker we'll get to that we talked about
fuels but that's the way I like to cook

162
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:58,179
at its just a really good job and those
you have the rips last night so that's

163
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:05,179
what I could be next to that is the
orange grill with the eyeball horns

164
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:09,789
that's a pellet smoker so pale smokers
are basically designed to be set it and

165
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:12,859
forget those you just want to get into
smoking just want to cook the meats

166
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:15,720
don't really want to do can set it and
forget it

167
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,769
nothing wrong with that if that's what
you want to do what you want to go with

168
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:25,869
rec text very good companies a lot of
good ones out there and basically uses

169
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:30,399
use a little wooden pallets originally
done for wood burning stoves and pellet

170
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,019
stoves and you are using this money
using in smokers your led controller

171
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,419
which will show you later on and say to
go and you know it ten hours later

172
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:50,159
whenever your thermometer goes off to
use the green he went to the next one is

173
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:57,809
a commodity that's what the Big Green
Acres smokers are influenced very easy

174
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:02,579
to smoke with the use of force they use
what's called direct indirect or direct

175
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:07,009
indirect cooking basically it's still
directly over the flame however it's so

176
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:11,490
far away that smokes it doesn't cook it
it doesn't cook it very quickly the way

177
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,659
that age group

178
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:19,989
smokers can same concept usually Joe
Walker trade in there but I shaped like

179
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:26,409
a bullet whether smoking now we're
talking about and are generally one of

180
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:36,239
the most vulnerable during breakers
other good news to the next one is known

181
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:44,559
as an ugly drum smoker effectively what
happens is rednecks got together and

182
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,570
rather low on funds and several what we
have sitting around we can make a smoker

183
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:59,029
out of and very quickly draw a lot of
enthusiasm on the internet and you can

184
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:06,369
find several several dozens of different
plans to build smokers out drugs

185
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:15,359
the next one in particular is an offset
locks so that's a rather long run into a

186
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,909
pole behind if anyone was up at the
party there was one very similar to that

187
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:30,519
but it had integrated firebox along with
a controller maintaining within it

188
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:35,259
what was very interesting about that one
is multi-stage

189
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:44,080
actually had two planes with independent
333 planes on it with independent levels

190
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:54,900
no controls and thermostat controls it
was not cheap no boss got that one sorry

191
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,740
the next one is a traditional offset
that's the one that I normally cook on

192
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:09,650
so if you've been a part of the parties
at my house previously ok Joe very

193
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,480
similar design and those are you
actually usually nickname traditionally

194
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,710
cheap office and the reason why is it
that when they come to the hardware

195
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,430
store sleep like a hundred and fifty two
hundred bucks to do the job the problem

196
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:26,520
is that they're not they're not sealed
so really make them do you like you

197
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,860
might make some decent BBQ from their
turn in the store but you can actually

198
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,760
go through there and you can check your
BBQ reseal it at some modifications

199
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,880
inventor but still cheapest smoker and
you really really awesome smoker that

200
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:47,590
didn't cost you up at the BOK joke that
I use is about $400 the seals on it are

201
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:54,330
abysmal for about fifteen to twenty
dollars you can buy proper food grade

202
00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:01,070
silicone fiberglass seals and turn it
into a really nice if you follow what we

203
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,240
show you later on the custom PID add
that to the two like something like a

204
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,560
cheap offset smoker and give yourself
further control over it almost seemed

205
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,150
over control the capital's

206
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:19,440
so next most important the next thing
we're smoking meat is the one so many

207
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,130
choices before we get to the window and
talk about so what does not necessarily

208
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:31,590
fuel it is but it isn't it's more about
what is about the most appropriate

209
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,480
electrical familiar with you plug it in

210
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,030
it's basically like an oven that gives
you the ability to smoke chips a propane

211
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,880
somewhere like a propane grill at home
same concept just turn on the propane if

212
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,560
you're very clean burning fuel and then
charcoal

213
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:56,610
now the interesting thing is chuckles
actually it's basically charcoal most of

214
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,930
the irritants are the truck so the
actual Fleer get to meet is when it's

215
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,250
burning release irritants into the air
and those irritants get on the food

216
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,650
Welch our collection is free of 102
should get some flavor but you never

217
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,020
gonna get it seemed that you would with
just burning fresh so that's why we use

218
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,440
those meanies fuel so when you hear all
the debates on one charcoal briquettes

219
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,980
except its products just so if anyone's
unaware charcoal is actually carbonized

220
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,980
would you would you put it out before
it's finished

221
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:37,080
combusting some of the brick catch that
you will get are manufactured largely

222
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:44,790
out of coconut

223
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,730
this competition smokers that
competition so basically go when they're

224
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,180
asked what do they use essentially
whatever was on sale or whatever the

225
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,310
free charcoal that the competition is
they don't care about other things

226
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:04,790
besides the truck so next time we get to
date with you just tell them stuff

227
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:11,390
you're kind of worrying too much over so
many other words that we use for the

228
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,920
primary which people smoke with mesquite
so those are that Derby last night were

229
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:25,660
using mesquite that was a big big part 1
log left outside of Texas and some of

230
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,030
the other places in the south is
mesquite subpoena find up north in

231
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,770
fortunes very expensive one of my
favorite flavors when it comes to beef

232
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,970
up smoking

233
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:45,950
but I do it's delicious on beef its
outstanding views on beef myself because

234
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:52,610
in Chicago it's really easy to find so I
guess that's a good flavor to it a

235
00:22:52,610 --> 00:23:01,020
little better myself but there's people
swear by ok I'll go depends on which one

236
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:10,490
to use I mean wow yeah yeah and smile
more miles so I tried to curry special

237
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:19,650
report in which you have a lot of
restaurants hit very very tasty very

238
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:26,580
good very good tasting would one of my
favorite especially now is generally

239
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:33,720
tend to be mixed with other words given
a journey through forget to the fruit

240
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,490
which no one other than that I
recommended me

241
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:42,270
maple is very much like the same flavors
just not sure what's nice about maple is

242
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:47,900
that we don't get a little bit them
sweet taste to commit to me so that's

243
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,720
another favorite of mine report came
with poultry as well as the use maple

244
00:23:51,720 --> 00:24:04,510
and then do some fruit as a way to show
you can use a speech i guess its hard

245
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,960
here

246
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,350
essentially any with you when do you
wanna make sure it's not green you wanna

247
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:17,330
make sure the driveway so you don't have
to like evergreens and smoke because it

248
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,820
will ruin your or your guests may have
an evergreen lucky you also don't want

249
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,060
to kill that would be bad

250
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:31,000
the two most commonly used in that died
10 years I know kinda uses our Apple

251
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:40,350
ensure so I usually use the Apple Isle
of Palms it is fantastic

252
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:45,050
cheery little better it just gives us a
little bit part to it and to me the

253
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:50,320
flavors just a little bit more than what
Apple does but against all persons you

254
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:59,840
can't go wrong with you I don't like you
like the cherry last night so here's a

255
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,480
list on the slide to some other words
that you utilize what kind of food that

256
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,110
are used to it if you're interested in
this document supply companies charge is

257
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:15,210
published on the internet and they give
the wood types what the rumors are with

258
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,130
the suggested uses are and what to
expect with them all posts aside

259
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:29,860
somewhere see so now we gotta know we
got their meat I'm sorry we got a smoker

260
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,930
now we got her now we need some
accessories to cook you can cook with

261
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,140
some important for instance

262
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:47,290
so we meet this is what we use on a lot
of different ways to do it and we'll

263
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,950
talk about that in just a little bit but
this is causing trouble for those who

264
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:56,230
aren't really I do whatever my means

265
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:02,419
thermometers if I can tell you the most
important thing outside of the word and

266
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:09,910
deed smoker to have to meet obviously a
reason why is he would tell you oh look

267
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:16,190
that brisket or 12 hours it's no your
gonna have usually rock hard brisket

268
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,250
that's every brisket is different every
piece of meat is different it's never

269
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:25,059
gonna take this gonna be the same so
what do you want to measure the

270
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:31,780
temperature at the proper temperature in
some cases you need twelve time for

271
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:37,809
instance country roofs so I'll smoke
those for about three to four hours of

272
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:46,240
pro home Pan Am pan with BBQ sauce peer
eval and then wait till they had around

273
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,179
180 renewal there for about three hours
and by the time they come out and there

274
00:26:51,179 --> 00:27:01,120
and so important this is it instant read
thermometer thermometer when you open it

275
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,970
up stepping to the needs this particular
one is considered the Lamborghini to

276
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:15,679
read the monitors about 80 bucks or not
she thurman by thermal and gets ass gets

277
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,130
a reading about to say absolutely love
it I will never go back to using using

278
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:25,980
one they are very well respected on the
internet look opinion reviews on them

279
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,110
people absolutely looked up and said
you're probably thinking god you're not

280
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:35,450
spending $80 on thermometer and you're
right so they also make one called

281
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,840
thermal thermal pop and thermal pops are
about 20 bucks same great quality to

282
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,340
take a little longer read about five
seconds but

283
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,200
just getting into smoking that's what
they recommend $20 Milan Amazon by me

284
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,640
where same company thermal works the
opposite the individual thermometer

285
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:04,750
fantastic that we have these are easily
go to mom she said probes on what you do

286
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:10,630
with this issue put one of these on
rates when it meets this one takes up to

287
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:17,320
four which is really nice what we were
doing last we're doing yesterday

288
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,870
afternoon was we kept our approach with
this be kept coming off into ones that

289
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,690
are still cooking so they had that way
we hit when Gallup temperature it go in

290
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:36,320
go ahead and rested in Coolidge for the
event and essentially a probe into the

291
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:45,670
next piece of meat industry price on
this season and then $20 comes through

292
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,460
the probes are considered consumable
they will eventually we're generally

293
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,980
it's a good idea to have an extra one on
hand till they get the Amazon drones

294
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:04,430
anyways its am a break so be here uses I
sold my girl yeah I have a micro

295
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:10,450
absolutely love it again that's another
model

296
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:18,420
batteries in those last four ever and
I've literally had over 30 hours of cook

297
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:25,620
time on two double A's 40 hours this is
an infrared gonna love this thing this

298
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,850
is give you surface temperature I
specially like this one on grilling

299
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:35,510
steak because I'm trying to sear the
meat can get high pile beard claims and

300
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:41,540
just Syria get the good temperature and
tell me oh that's 90 degrees cool my

301
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:54,360
steak and you could see on the meat of
importance loves always have clubs those

302
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,290
you well this around on me burn my
fingers multiple times in with the

303
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:02,710
globe's butt plugs goodwin's cos

304
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,230
burned fingers and do other things just
for the record I never burn myself and I

305
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,840
don't look

306
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:19,440
find your question he'll do that make
you blush in your grill grille scrub it

307
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:31,150
it doesn't add flavor to the woodchucks
by what young sandbagged buy whole logs

308
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:36,970
you can buy chips by have laws by Ricks

309
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,049
people forget baby wipes the greatest
things ever

310
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:49,570
not just reading BBQ before cleaning
brushes so you can based based based

311
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:55,730
sauces on based on for things like that

312
00:30:55,730 --> 00:31:06,940
their paws I found it funny to read more
fantastic these things are about 10 to

313
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:14,690
15 bucks on the best in the 50 bucks or
maybe if you've ever tried to shred

314
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,500
eighty-pound support you know what I'm
talking about

315
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,360
thank you for spending all that time
along the other ones that was but thank

316
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,330
you partner for spending all the time
did cutting brisket and pork butcher

317
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,679
paper this is a relatively new I start
to start using based on current

318
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,620
franklin's suggested this way he uses
facts in color is where he uses in his

319
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:45,120
shot and I used to wrestle like Paul
briskets much which dries out very

320
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:52,820
sluggish me when it comes to smoking and
what they saw what you should do is you

321
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,610
cook it to about a hundred and sixty
degrees the brisket often wrap it put it

322
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:04,440
back on finishing that helps keep the
brisket well the problem with doing it

323
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,880
is usually do it in tin foil aluminum
foil it softens the book

324
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,020
so you lose a little bit hard crystal
ball found the answer if you like the

325
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,410
hard crunchy bar please follow his
advice

326
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:26,030
otherwise if you like the salt to latin
dance bars wrap Injen CAI do so at this

327
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:30,790
year's is so what what a couple
pitmasters figured out is that having

328
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:38,570
rapid in your paper for even more and
Mark still stays crunchy as much as

329
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,770
possible can also from what I heard you
can actually still get a little bit

330
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:49,890
smoke smoke permeation into the media
using the but you don't know if it's

331
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,940
true or not but that's just what it also
goes for resting if you're pulling in

332
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:00,250
now to rest and you don't want to the
park to solve hamlets resting use timers

333
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,380
just keep track of how long you cook
something going

334
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,600
important one when you pull your meat so
whenever I probably need a good arrested

335
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:19,960
Western ensure that the stock is very
very full those who knows what the

336
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,910
camera with you can see a MRO its work
in restaurants catering anything like

337
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:30,810
this again insulated box to put food in
to keep warm while there's still a

338
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,630
couple hundred bucks using its an
insulated channels it depends on the

339
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:41,950
size of your going fairly small hold
several steam table pans right very

340
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,780
large ones are industrial sized think of
the size of large refrigerators with the

341
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:56,290
slide the shams and so basically what
you in this is especially important when

342
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,370
you're resting what you rescue me when
you pull it off with that uses get back

343
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,700
in there or what's your cook finishes
early like what happened yesterday where

344
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,100
r

345
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:10,280
army was ready at 6:30 in the morning
and we had pulled off inhabit still warm

346
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,119
for later on what you do is use of
course you can create that you can

347
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,250
create both him and what you do you put
the meat in the core you take down to

348
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,560
put a towel down the court and the new
stuff tells inside the media and you

349
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,570
pull some of the tells out and basically
creating insulate environment so you had

350
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:35,169
that they had the need for that mean it
literally been a smoker for about 12

351
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:41,720
camera still was warm still enjoy it and
that's what's that which fantastic so

352
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,889
round about 2 a.m. he started sliding
everything in the fridge and tearing

353
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:52,159
stuff down there were still coming out
there were other stuff

354
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,020
controllers and show you a little bit
later nice good nice life so much easier

355
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:02,000
good fillet knife slicing knife things
like that and sharpeners

356
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:12,170
tongs and spatula as people get food off
Russia's so meet in my bed different

357
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:21,310
kinds of music we have very favorite
part of mine brisket pulled pork ribs

358
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,740
sausage

359
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:28,010
any kind of me some work better than
others but those are some of the main

360
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:28,680
ones again

361
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:39,440
brisket pork chicken sausage shops like
to say it's an unconventional but it's

362
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,869
rather run short kind they're pretty k
see if your gonna competition the

363
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:44,820
general look around

364
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,500
pulled pork brisket

365
00:35:47,500 --> 00:36:00,520
website sausage KCBS he's so those that
were at the event yesterday preparing to

366
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,180
meet for testing this is kind of what
this is a very high level what they did

367
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:10,510
to us if you like to do is to drive
prime who's who here has thanksgiving

368
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:17,460
has a bucketful salt dip Turkey in there
let sit for four days alright so you're

369
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,620
right now stop that really dangerous and
here's the thing you don't need to do

370
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,290
what you can do something called tried
driving what you do is you take so long

371
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,860
to put it on there and it actually just
as much liquid into the meat as if you

372
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,570
were a great website called them using
wix.com because action and scientific

373
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,540
testing on it with food scientists and
show you exactly how much more should

374
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:45,030
come from each morning kind of proves
that dr Brady is the way to go and why

375
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:55,480
should they not doing to disease and
actually increases your chances are it's

376
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,380
the perfect environment for Salmonella
various other nasty things you don't

377
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,330
want to be the main problem is that you
never get to watch the frigid big enough

378
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:09,550
to put it in there ok you can do it like
me I never in fridge big enough so we

379
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,060
came down Thanksgiving 30 degrees
outside let's just put the bucket

380
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:20,310
outside in the garage and that's just
the best dual SIM across hope we can go

381
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:26,060
from there and no one dies on
thanksgiving has but trust me the family

382
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,260
members I wish that wasn't true but you
know

383
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,870
so Dr Brian so what we do is we are you
going to do depending on the meats

384
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,780
brisket I'll do about 33

385
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:46,040
regret it if you use tape but about half
on one side happen the other children do

386
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:56,220
two teaspoons one on each side and ribs
argue about half teaspoons total hours

387
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:02,540
you can let it go to Canada go overnight
stay true to some steaks to cook your

388
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,780
steak salad on how I hope time dry up
trying to put it back in the fridge when

389
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,660
you come back to states like to see
little moisture on the surface that's

390
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:15,120
how you know that's what you're so what
I actually start doing now is these are

391
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,410
commercial trucks have salt you have to
watch out when you're doing this if

392
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:27,380
you're using commercial rub your through
when I trimming down I usually go to bed

393
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:35,990
sorry we keep on the meat so when you
get stuff like pork shoulder risk it has

394
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:40,810
a large or something to keep it all on
the trip not have two words to me that's

395
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,920
don't do that one because it doesn't

396
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,410
permeate into the meat more importantly
a good part of you trust in some of the

397
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:55,760
best parts so I usually do about a
quarter of an inch or more

398
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,830
gives just enough protection to me what
some render outs and join but it doesn't

399
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:07,910
leave too much on there for the same
with pulled pork on the same thing about

400
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:15,610
a quarter of an inch away a quarter to
date someone do more but that's me

401
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:24,520
identical I'm I'm currently doing if you
don't and I can eat pretty much all the

402
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,680
means that I want so why do I think of
the other members in the house that's

403
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:39,960
where they wanted different they can go
to argue that one so since since we Dr

404
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,850
Brian now we're actually doing it now so
people tell you just put rubber from the

405
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:50,040
stock here's the sorbents for me that's
not true the only thing that hurt him

406
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,100
because the salt so I put this copy web
on here gathered flavors are not getting

407
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,990
into the meat you're staying on the
surface that's why we saw the first you

408
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:05,850
with all my drugs I usually make my own
website home I will consult my rugs and

409
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:11,310
after reporting on the grill I'll put
the rub on without the salt way I

410
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:19,290
usually don't do as I will meet with
olive oil and mix it up a bit better you

411
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:28,110
can also use fat notably that works
fantastic to labor for the rock this is

412
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:33,320
after the salt so I will take it out of
the fridge at least sitting in front of

413
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,730
me I will take olive oil-based the
entire thing a while and then I will put

414
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,670
my rub on top of it

415
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,610
you want to cover it if you want you
will for sure your food and it's

416
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:50,860
specially has salt in it just because
you want to get your life you've been

417
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:59,250
run over by myself it's very easy to do
more space you're sweet rub on there so

418
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:04,770
I went to get a little sweet in there
and use some will be brown sugar I don't

419
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:12,060
want too sweet but I want the pepper in
the brown sugar that's my personal now

420
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,430
be fighting like more people I love so I
guess last night brisket for those who

421
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,220
had it

422
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,170
simply black pepper it was about
three-quarters black pepper to about one

423
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:27,520
quarter past week I that's what I like
to call it with someone actually

424
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:36,130
recently suggested to me I am very
curious to see how it ends up working

425
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:43,670
out and I generally go with garlic
recommended cutting cutting holes and

426
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,609
stuffing a clove of garlic and
throughout the brisket sounds fantastic

427
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:51,210
as well to new tricks for me try going
forward

428
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:55,849
don't worry about room temperature
you'll hear the thing about him to be

429
00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:13,880
sure you never let us know when you pull
out the fridge so the legal in your room

430
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:21,390
temperature it's okay and then when she
already prepped smoker let it cook

431
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:29,349
measure temperatures so now you have
money to buy a smoker let's build our

432
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:35,640
own small so onerous we're looking at
the ugly drum smoker we've got a URL

433
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,210
provided here

434
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:45,580
parts list and walks you through our
smoker's we modify some light a little

435
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,420
bit

436
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:51,740
we tried to go cheaper on that and so
that we can spend more money on and does

437
00:42:51,740 --> 00:43:00,150
control automation effectively the goals
was to make a cheap and easy smoker

438
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:06,170
minimize the amount of calls that are
required and sustain even cooking

439
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,960
temperatures automation

440
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:17,660
well yeah and I liked all souls like a
settling tortures you know you want to

441
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,450
get out and make welder so so building
your own smoking see the parts list here

442
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:29,190
this is basic smoker so we spent about
$15 on a clean drum check Craigslist

443
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:36,640
you'll find there is a plethora of drunk
so what you have to be careful for

444
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,230
though is what is inside them and what
has been inside them ideally you don't

445
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:48,190
want to buy one that has been used for
oils fuel that will be a bad idea

446
00:43:48,190 --> 00:44:02,460
yes more radioactive contaminants you
don't want those either yeah food grade

447
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:08,240
oils are ok and does drew a bad you
still have to burn off great oil so that

448
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,460
you can paint them otherwise you're
gonna have a hard problem getting the

449
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:23,770
pictures if you do that yes so charcoal
great we are smoker we selected two

450
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:30,420
grades 1 approximately the size of the
inner diameter and one slightly smaller

451
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:36,299
she later why that it is a hardware
store even get a Weber 22.5 inch grill

452
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:46,319
sexy yep the wellbore expanded steel why
in particular you want the weldable is

453
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,200
because you don't want to cope with
anything nasty you're going to be

454
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,559
burning this and then eating the food
that is rendered in the smoke

455
00:44:53,559 --> 00:45:01,140
miscellaneous bolts not handles washers
so far through the project was roughly

456
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,859
$10 so just for the Bears smoker

457
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:13,549
around seventy-five eighty dollars and
pretty ugly drum smoker and it's exactly

458
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:22,160
what it is ya cheaper than yessir yeah I
was going to point that out earlier when

459
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,020
he was going through the various smokers
is that quite a few of those are

460
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:34,829
thousands of dollars quite a few right
around $1000 very few of them were some

461
00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:42,890
500 my mind that I use the 50 most
$1,500 emotional overspent on the grow

462
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:53,099
so tools what tools do you need to
collect drills you'll need a metal

463
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:58,240
holesaw you'll need drill bits that are
capable of drilling through the barrel

464
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:08,630
the propane torch which is optional but
fun and yes yes he did and any other

465
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:13,680
miscellaneous stuff you might need so
sharpy's for marking tape measures and

466
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,540
so on

467
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:19,910
most people have all of them

468
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:25,829
so adding PID controller lives so when
we expect this again we were trying to

469
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:32,809
make this easy and affordable and
hopefully no one injured while building

470
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:39,010
this so in particular what we selected
was a PID controller that dealt with 12

471
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:48,250
hole to hole out there so is low enough
on the D seaside that if you should

472
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:55,349
accidentally touched something you're
not gonna die in addition I 812 old PC

473
00:46:55,349 --> 00:47:00,940
brushless blower so basically the little
blowers are you put in your PC that's

474
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:08,599
literally what a plus and a stainless
steel pipi 103 problem for mister those

475
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:16,940
all wired directly to the PC controller
so Amazon prices right now floating

476
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:22,349
right around $61 for that price that's
the bare minimal that you need to

477
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:31,099
retrofit an existing smoker or take a
UDS and attach PID controller

478
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:38,529
here you can see a diagram of a simple
lovely drum smoker at the bottom of the

479
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:42,359
drum you have the area on the outside

480
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:48,289
that's where we would attach the blower
to the PID control you have a fire grate

481
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:54,200
which you'll see later on how he built
and again that's also on the dot com

482
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:00,660
building instructions this design in
particular had a fire and heat diffuser

483
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,329
it's not really necessary

484
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:07,559
it does help to even out the
temperatures there are multiple designs

485
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:12,140
for this as well there are some people
who put an additional rate their stack

486
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:17,599
it with fire bricks are some people who
used the steel is a deflector and then

487
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,849
drove in holes in the next layer up you
can see already removal cooking grates

488
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:28,359
those are the great he was speaking of
that are available at most hardware

489
00:48:28,359 --> 00:48:34,920
stores most of the big boxes carriers
and then the top obviously is the lid

490
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,069
errol so you want to look at that also
when you're buying the barrel so make

491
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:48,450
sure it's got like a staggering list you
will have to peel off the seal that goes

492
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:53,849
on lid that its heels with and you won't
need any more we didn't do it for this

493
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:56,890
but you can also if you have an
all-weather grow twenty two and a half

494
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,920
inches again same exact size

495
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:05,309
pro-parliament on literally fits right
on top of it and and it's got the air

496
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:12,380
flow adjustment so you don't have to get
out the drill to drill those so

497
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:19,749
proceeding into the bill to the smoker
first you need to burn the propane

498
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:25,640
torches are extremely fun please use
caution with them it takes a really long

499
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,930
time for the barrel to cool off as
mister bear will tell you

500
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:38,040
again the gloves so after you're done
burning it you need to wipe it down

501
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:44,630
scrub you can use cleaner wire brush wet
dry sandpaper whatever you need to do to

502
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:49,540
remove that last bit of cash now this is
where I was saying that getting a clean

503
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,059
barrels important so depending on what
is inside of you when I have a hell of a

504
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:58,230
time getting this cleaned off if there
is rust inhibitor inside of the barrel

505
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:04,210
you are going to be sending it is going
to take you along time ago we found

506
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:09,309
barrels that didn't have anything and so
yes we found barrels who had food

507
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:14,510
service stuff and were stored in plastic
liners so you go find the ones that

508
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:19,650
didn't have a leaky liner and their
pristine clean on the inside charging

509
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:28,059
extra $5 so building your basket here
you can see the smaller great with the

510
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:34,280
expanded steel wrapped around him to
form the chimney so using the great gets

511
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:40,349
to cheer me up off the bottom of the
smoker and allows the PR de VC brushless

512
00:50:40,349 --> 00:50:45,510
fan driven by the PID to control the
amount of airflow that is being tried to

513
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:50,250
the chimney so that the chimney burns
appropriately and you can easily adjust

514
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,470
he dependent on the air

515
00:50:54,470 --> 00:51:00,430
some next you need to drill holes you
need

516
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:05,670
russell's at the top of the smoke to
vacate the barrel you need holes around

517
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:10,960
the barrel appropriately so that you can
get the inserts in and have something

518
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:19,640
for the group to rest on at the smoking
rubble next you need to paint your

519
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:26,319
barrel let that dry and then add your
PID controller to the bottom of the

520
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,910
barrel again at the bottom there

521
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:35,349
after everything is dried all your
silicon is cure to everything is

522
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:41,099
finished you entered the basket at the
bottom of the barrel as seen in the

523
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:50,260
diagram earlier you like the charcoal
ensure you were proper ills turn the PID

524
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:56,200
controller on and you need to set the
autotune any control over that you get

525
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:01,380
nowadays has an attitude autotune mode
so that you don't have to sit down with

526
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:07,720
a slide roll into advanced calculus to
figure it out what the author does is it

527
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:16,760
allows the variable output from the
controller to hone in on the temperature

528
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,660
that you're aiming it also will
continuously reach so its environmental

529
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:29,839
conditions change it will then adapt to
those so Sun comes out gets cloudy

530
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:35,760
someone opens the door for instance on
internal control systems they built that

531
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,150
in so that you have a way to just
typically some of them will overshoot

532
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:46,450
somewhat but once a overshoot they
really just a reminder of themselves

533
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:50,369
frame realize up and then you're good to
go again and one thing when you let your

534
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:54,730
drill please be careful and a neighbor
that almost his house down because he

535
00:52:54,730 --> 00:53:00,119
tried to use a leaf blower to get the
flames going very fast very hot and

536
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:06,880
works with flying everywhere and get
some stuff about his wife I don't think

537
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:13,140
it's still talking to him so be very
careful use a light in like using what's

538
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:20,099
called chimney starter to get some goals
in their newspaper using a wax human

539
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:24,240
light it gets in their report charcoal
is good to go

540
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,950
how she uses propane flame thrower which
yes I do actually a lot more fun

541
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:34,270
just be careful and at the same time
that thing sounds like a jet turban and

542
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:40,480
it will work just as well as well so be
very careful with those some charcoal

543
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:47,170
when you hit them with a propane torch
will top and crack like popcorn what

544
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:56,359
yourself just don't do it inside the
house I hope your this stupid but make

545
00:53:56,359 --> 00:54:01,630
sure carbon carbon monoxide will kill
you make sure you dragged away from the

546
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:07,310
house not too closely you'll be careful
where you put it where it could be

547
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:17,740
careful when you use it and also to
point out as you said to life with a

548
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:22,250
charcoal chimney that's effectively what
you built in the bottom is some

549
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:26,839
additional you Diaz modification plans
that i've seen

550
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:31,550
include handles onto the great so that
you light it outside and then you pick

551
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:41,010
it up and set it down one of the ones I
had actually does that so there you're

552
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:50,520
done so the basket is big enough on a
UDS that it will run for 10 hours

553
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:57,369
untouched ideally the PID controller is
your temperatures are are heading and

554
00:54:57,369 --> 00:55:02,240
you don't have a lot outside variables
you'll get about a 10 hour burn

555
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:09,460
the plans that we show when they sing
about the smokers to PC so they are all

556
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,650
very well he still really well really
well that's why the chief upsets me

557
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:19,840
because of the fact they are they don't
feel very well better sealed better off

558
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:27,610
the more feeling my particular when I
usually just yeah he's got a long

559
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:33,320
learner so if anyone's never solves look
one up there really interesting the box

560
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,369
actually sets external on top of the
smoking chamber and then it's got in

561
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:42,930
that role as the smoke down and threw it

562
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:47,390
same as a PID you set the temperature
and it tries to maintain the temperature

563
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:52,030
but drawing it through where is the
union's PID controller designed pushes

564
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:56,619
the area were quick to say some thank
yous and then I'll take some questions

565
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:02,140
so robert thank you

566
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:10,540
is Austin Arbour my wife and my kids
thank you thank you for not killing me

567
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:17,850
making ribs dot com again when I go to
sites absolutely love it was great about

568
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:23,540
that site is the actually take a look at
your BBQ pits the mall action using real

569
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:29,930
science so this crowd it's actually
really interesting there's a lot of food

570
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:34,910
science behind one of the articles that
he goes then thanks to regulate the bus

571
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:39,170
floor

572
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:52,170
thank you very much any questions

573
00:56:52,170 --> 00:57:06,809
generally I'm actually looking at
expanding the next iteration I'm looking

574
00:57:06,809 --> 00:57:12,790
at is hooking the apt 102 directly to a
Raspberry Pi and then using the

575
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:18,619
Raspberry Pi to various plans but in
that fashion then we can cheaply easily

576
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:20,859
and affordably ideally

577
00:57:20,859 --> 00:57:26,880
Bluetooth le food probes as well hold
the food pros and then be able to

578
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:33,680
integrate goes into the calculations as
well they do sell commercial controllers

579
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:40,859
that do that you were talking well in
excess of $100 or like I said they're

580
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:55,150
they're not cheap so

581
00:57:55,150 --> 00:58:00,040
design it was effectively question was
what what is the PID measuring so

582
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,420
effectively on this design

583
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:08,040
wherever you put the probe at its
measuring and the air temperature at

584
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:16,770
that location we headed up a generally
any probes that used to measure

585
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:21,339
temperature you want to get as close to
the greatest possible you don't want to

586
00:58:21,339 --> 00:58:26,790
measure office you don't want to measure
top barrel obviously bottom we're also

587
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:32,520
going to do anything as you have grills
a little thermometers crap they're

588
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,089
terrible sorry 50 to 75 degrees yeah
they're measuring at the top of the

589
00:58:37,089 --> 00:58:58,839
fence and specifically to the smoking
industries so you'll find that those are

590
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:07,480
far more expensive than those standards
that they used for heating units trade

591
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:13,650
on the ease of use treats off or more
expenses generally if your gonna record

592
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:18,230
would and you're you're actually running
logs you'll find that the markup between

593
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:23,599
smoking woods and burning looks are not
a lot of you call around specially

594
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,099
offseason and you find someone who has
would that they're trying to get rid of

595
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:32,670
and it has been stored properly you can
usually get those for a pretty good

596
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:45,240
price cuz they're not so you see salt

597
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:51,900
I like course lakes not the chunks you
usually find so some sea salt and I

598
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:56,230
bought course lakes that's really more
chunky so what you find a brand you like

599
00:59:56,230 --> 01:00:03,460
stick with your brand because a lot of
people really like dry ingredients and

600
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,640
the barbecue competitions as well

601
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,050
simply because you get more consistent
results out of it it's hard to repeat

602
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:15,790
ERISA be ten times if you're using fresh
ingredients every time which kind of

603
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:19,990
really sounds counterintuitive but if
you're going at the competition level

604
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:24,830
you need repeatability and really the
only way to get that is with preserved

605
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:47,510
angry and so most people will do it
another way of doing you any sacrifice

606
01:00:47,510 --> 01:01:02,320
your boxes is you can do it started out
you have a drip cap foot soaks up in the

607
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:06,369
air

608
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:11,790
additionally I've heard of people
pulling that off letting it cool some

609
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:18,609
like putting it back into injectors and
then re-injected get back into the I'm

610
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:25,000
not done that it's honestly to me it's
done the couple times the second we are

611
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,690
told you don't to me it makes a small
difference but not enough that I'd

612
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:33,369
rather have the question mark on there
so I usually do affect kept up with a

613
01:01:33,369 --> 01:01:36,130
girl I don't usually cover my pork butts

614
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:55,500
anybody who's been to any of my previous
parties you always have ever do i do so

615
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:07,070
that particular design their heads or
with layers of wood chunks and lighting

616
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:08,660
it from one side to the other

617
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:14,750
closest to the end so that it burns
across some people swear that burning

618
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,530
bottom-up works better

619
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:20,420
some people swear burning bone down
works better I have not really seen any

620
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:24,750
difference in them unless you have an
extremely leaky smoker that you were

621
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:29,800
trying to conserve fuel ideally you do
all of your adjustment for temperature

622
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:35,060
at the bottom great in this particular
design that we were showing that's all

623
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:43,890
controlled by the PID so if if nobody
picked that up so the output of the PID

624
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:49,580
controller is variable it's not a static
on and off like a real a little send

625
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:55,310
pulses and then speed the process up and
then slow them down based on the temper

626
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:59,440
temperature difference that is trying to
achieve so that is less likely to

627
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:05,910
overshoot and so I'm in question because
I think people want to get dinner and

628
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:12,180
working hard all day do you want to get
out of here so if you have any questions

629
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:18,080
please feel free to hit us up on Twitter

630
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:24,610
thank you

631
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:38,910
a couple cum all those are actually
really really
