1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,630
great gateways can you guys hear me back
there now i wana I I try to talk a lot

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,440
about that is that better now

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,559
ok we'll go with that

4
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:21,880
alright z-wave is a proprietary protocol
by Sigma Designs is primarily used in

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,619
home automation security solutions in a
smart metering Sigma Designs they've

6
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:31,189
partnered with over 250 companies
including big names like Rand ATT

7
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:39,430
Verizon and LG Electronics you wave is
based on the ice UTG 9959 recommendation

8
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:46,559
it specifies short-range communication
in the subject spectrum depending on the

9
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,489
country that does you a protocol is
being used in the frequencies are very

10
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,440
specifically in the USA is 908 point for
in Europe it's believed 860 I'm so just

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,640
vary depending on region on this is a
snapshot of these you a reference model

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,020
with respect to the tcp/ip reference
model so the vendors differentiate based

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,880
on the application layer in the riding
later but all of them are based on

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:17,009
though the fine Mac i GTG 9959
specification and all the networks there

15
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,860
are two types of nose their control
nodes and their slave nodes there's also

16
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:26,100
a dedicated home ideal for network
overlap with without interference on any

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,950
given you a network you can have up to
two hundred thirty two nodes and Sigma

18
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,140
Designs requires an easy way developer
to sign a non-disclosure agreement and

19
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,790
this prevents open-source research
therefore little is known about the

20
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,680
security implications of its use

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,299
snapshot of the end devices there is a
smart situation let my fuel door lock in

22
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,840
their fortunes water valve

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:58,250
so and z-wave the control nodes are
often referred to as gateway gateway

24
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,740
devices their transit network devices
what this means is it's it's almost like

25
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,950
a miniature router this is in it either
way to distract you but it's a trans

26
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,599
network device so the homeowner or the
user will send a wifi packet or or some

27
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,849
kind of command to the device from the
white wifi WLAN interface the router the

28
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,910
gate we take said and then sends out his
UA of command so fans network device in

29
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,900
NY file Gwave gateways can be used to
access the device is locally or globally

30
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,760
so you could come home you know that
scenes actively lights and switches but

31
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,030
you can also access your home or
security solution from anywhere

32
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,470
geographically with a cell phone app or
any internet-connected computer and

33
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,790
that's that's how the gateways are
primarily used this obviously introduces

34
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,920
an avenue of approaching a network the
internet so primary uses global

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:04,590
accessibility but now you can kinda
invite the world in your home gateway

36
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,459
devices the 1 I'm going going to attempt
in my demo is using the Raspberry Pi

37
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:14,750
with a raspberry GPIO general-purpose
input-output daughter card and some

38
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,930
other ones that work to it but there are
many many gateways out there all of them

39
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:27,049
provide global accessibility so gateway
access has garnered through the wireless

40
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:31,980
local area network backbone and because
of the chain of trust you can save

41
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,349
between the router and the Gateway when
you have access to the local area

42
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:41,120
network you have access to the Gateway
also social engineering attacks you know

43
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,060
phishing attacks prompting the target to
install Malarone device so that the

44
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,990
attacker get back and access

45
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:53,680
ways to access gateways an attacker
vulnerabilities are adhering to the

46
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,400
Kiwis because many of them not all but
many of them lack of user validation or

47
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,770
insecure web UI user interface lack of
Gateway encryption in transmission

48
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,630
encryption on the gateway into fault
enable any new services these inherent

49
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:18,150
vulnerabilities can cause EGP capture to
use for replay injection into the

50
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:23,310
network processing request forgery
enabling former modification on code

51
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,480
execution is rude and back in access and
all of these have been demonstrated on

52
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,170
varying degrees previously worked with a
couple of them in a lot of these

53
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:40,460
gateways are vulnerable in the reason
behind that is a lot of vendors just

54
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,770
wanna jump on the bandwagon the next big
thing tree guys have seen some of that

55
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:50,470
developing hardware systems not really
building it with security is it working

56
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,760
the Securities kind of maybe a last ever

57
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,890
45 but it's never read the entire
process so that's not really on the

58
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,360
vendors mind a lot of the times when
when they're developing these hardware

59
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:10,770
devices so 2015 stats 496 million
households just to give you a snapshot

60
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,790
of how many households use wifi wireless
local area networks while 45% are

61
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:26,280
encrypted with a view to 18% with wet in
about seven or eight percent with WPA 11

62
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,290
unencrypted in about 17 percent are
unknown at this is out of January this

63
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,460
year

64
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:38,330
so while the security wi-fi security can
be tracked using open source tools so

65
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:45,449
what I've read so that's a major in web
can be easily cracked in the WPA and

66
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:50,440
wpa2 what I've seen a lot even just
gaining my neighborhood you know the

67
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,330
SSID says this is the type of device and
a lot of homeowners don't change your

68
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,910
default admin password so it's really
easy to get into someone's wifi that way

69
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:06,099
we passed freezes dictionaries can help
greatly reducing password cracking time

70
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:12,060
right so once the targets breach once
you're on the wifi this is the route

71
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,840
we're gonna take really good compromise
insecure WLAN back bone scan for the

72
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,440
target so I guess first step in every
attackers reconnaissance you need to

73
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,960
know what you're looking for

74
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,360
Google all these manuals they have a lot
of identified fingerprints for instance

75
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,199
just by looking at the rasberry website
the Raspberry Pi website for the chip on

76
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,650
you know that the ports are open 43
takes you directly to the server port 80

77
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:47,020
for you to a remote login page so a lot
of these gateways have easily

78
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,139
identifiable fingerprints operating
systems like ours where I know who uses

79
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,580
this operating system do it is that maps
can

80
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:02,159
working you could easily find the IP
address now that you have that we take

81
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:08,180
you could craft a packet descend into
the Gateway so this was something kinda

82
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,370
interesting I did this work a couple
months ago in when I did it with the

83
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,230
Raspberry Pi

84
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,950
they do not use any authentication error
within the last month

85
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:29,120
indication and I was pretty impressive
that's also did that so often packets

86
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,650
ahead of time helps but if there is any
indication or cookie use packets gonna

87
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:42,690
be denied so it's really simple to steal
a cookie so regardless of you are not

88
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:48,750
stealing a cookie and changing the
postwar get requests you can make it

89
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,400
through actually devices on their
networks and manipulate their gateway

90
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,980
device as you please

91
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:59,330
so so now that we're in we figure we can
injector room controller into the

92
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:06,650
network now this is the exploitation of
a feature not I didn't find a loophole

93
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,460
into the device or its just a feature
will feature some of these gateway

94
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,730
devices have I'm so used inclusion and
exclusion is ever easy way to network

95
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:22,550
you include and exclude devices
generally from a portable remote

96
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,700
controller like this you can just put
this into inclusion mode and then

97
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,760
physically tell the device alright I'm
gonna put you into the network and the

98
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,190
controller accepts that device I'm so
that's how it's included similarly to

99
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:41,130
exclude you physically put the portable
controller in exclusion mode and you

100
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,280
physically touch the device and the
exclude the only way the device can be

101
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,710
excluded from the network is if it
matches perfectly with the device the

102
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,030
device goes ok thats device to that
wants to be excluded I'm going to

103
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,720
exclude device to into my stool with
gateway devices like the Raspberry Pi

104
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,830
they allowed you I are they allowed
inclusion and exclusion from the user

105
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,440
interface you don't need physical access
to the controller therefore you can

106
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,340
injector room controller from outside
the home in this was tested up to

107
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,730
21 meters outside a home you get access
to the wireless network it possible to

108
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,300
inject a row controller into the network
mediating access it is you have to Isis

109
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:29,110
so this one feature of you I inclusion
treat serious implications I'm so just a

110
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,370
step through road controller injection
this is actually my home

111
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:42,500
washer and dryer not depicted but that's
where they would be so this is your way

112
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,370
home automation network with a gateway
and six notes on the network so step one

113
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:54,550
wireless local area networks compromise
so think it is ok to crack your wifi

114
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,260
password that's fine but what about a
neighbor later the good stuff I guess so

115
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:07,280
it's just the wireless local area
network security is pretty pretty pretty

116
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,950
serious secondly the hacker attacker
injects HTTP inclusion packet to the

117
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:19,030
Gateway so the gateway is now an
inclusion mode and reviews 2 controllers

118
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,330
for this and I'll be very evident why
but it's it's very much a cover your

119
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,640
tracks so the road controllers are set
to replicate mode so you set the the

120
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,540
Gateway uunet inclusion packet to the
Gateway said both these to replicate

121
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,310
mode controller one connects to the
gateway and begins receiving all network

122
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:43,000
traffic from the Raspberry Pi
simultaneously controller to its not

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,830
connecting to the Raspberry Pi because I
don't put them both in replicate those

124
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,650
simultaneously control everyone goes in
replicate mode connects directly to the

125
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,670
pie there is one channel and when I say
this to replicate noticed miss all the

126
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,680
traffic that's going between these two
devices so this is the only the Vikes

127
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,770
that actually getting added to the
network this crisis picking up all the

128
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,410
same traffic but it's not actually
getting added to the network

129
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:13,000
this debt now both controllers have
access to devices on the network they

130
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,350
have the same home I T and into a
protocol that the device devices sure

131
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,190
the same home I T they're on the same
network its I trust you you trust me

132
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,139
they have the same home I T and so
that's what's important to get the home

133
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:29,720
I T control device on the network now
they're they're fully trusted I told YQ

134
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,129
controllers covering your tracks as I
said

135
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,959
networks when you add a device to a
gateway controller that device is

136
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,889
repaired and multiple devices but in
that one instance those devices are

137
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:47,170
pared their trusted however that device
goes on the device list of the Gateway

138
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,079
you cannot remove it unless you exclude
the device now there's some great ways

139
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,639
that you can just right click and delete
from the you I was really easy to cover

140
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,639
your tracks the Raspberry Pi provided a
little bit more difficulty so I decided

141
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,800
to do that with two controllers but once
in the UI a homeowner would say hey

142
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,990
there two devices on my network there's
only supposed to be one obviously that's

143
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,380
fishy reset my network delete everything
freaked out called the cops probably not

144
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,540
but that's what they would do so adding
turow controllers to the network

145
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:25,009
technically only one cause this is the
traffic I can then exclude this from the

146
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:29,639
network which doesn't affect this so now
the device list goes from two back to

147
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,120
one this is excluded from the network
but this still maintains a home I D and

148
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,970
the device lewis also control the
network from outside the home and a cool

149
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,480
thing about these portable controllers
on the Gateway the homeowner has to have

150
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,920
access to the gateway to actually
devices so life I N Out this just

151
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,269
communicate in the subject spectrum so
if you unplug the Gateway retake the

152
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:56,279
Gateway off the wireless local area
network this is a 90 8.4 doesn't need to

153
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:03,030
keep waiting so you still maintain
persistent access to devices

154
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:10,990
alright so lastly you injected ATP
exclusion packet sent this to exclusion

155
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,790
mode gateway picks it up like this
controller for my network I'm going to

156
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,500
remove it so the first controllers
removed from the network and as I said

157
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,300
secondary controller that was never
actually at each step the traffic 1990

158
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:32,060
and access devices alright so quick demo
here so I came here they told me not to

159
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:39,270
do a demo just videotape in which is
gonna work it was working so I just saw

160
00:13:39,270 --> 00:14:01,860
connecting to wifi but as soon as it
does which it should know this won't so

161
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:10,350
give me a couple minutes ago just
targeting know each other

162
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,140
bathroom break and talk about the UEFA
now all cities how big of a deal that is

163
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:37,160
like I while this is booting up trying
to reset the router actually no one has

164
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:50,010
either Nicky Romero pocket series I
thought you see in 20 bucks to

165
00:14:50,010 --> 00:16:00,160
right look at the shop thanks yeah Thnkx
alright so because when I read repaid in

166
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,740
have any indication now they do and now
you need to steal the cookie now that's

167
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,710
that's fairly simple to steal that could
keep walking you through to steal a

168
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,170
cookie will show you how it put in
including so when he is cool because you

169
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,470
actually have to capture a packet on
that is turning out of ice on her off

170
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,780
and then just put a new command in there
that says add you know to the network

171
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,820
uses the same cookie and it
authenticates so my cookie expired

172
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:31,209
therefore I'm getting a break so I'm
just gonna

173
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:34,720
actually I couldn't I can do it a
different way which would still work

174
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:45,610
alright alright alright so what I'm
going to do is set this to inclusion and

175
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:56,029
then added to the network in this is
gonna snowfall the traffic and by the

176
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:02,550
way this is connected to a switch I just
plugged it in its just a power switch

177
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,409
when this turns on that little turned on
I think you probably won't hear the clip

178
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:31,200
from all the way back there so I read
aloud a hotel so now this is being added

179
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,620
to the network and the replication
started for this one so it's gaining the

180
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:46,899
traffic between both devices one thing I
needed to show you before I forget I

181
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:52,250
want to miss that

182
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:58,640
ok so there are two devices present
before I forgot that originally there

183
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,690
was one there is only the power switch
device now there are two devices on the

184
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,200
network the power switch in this device
the Gateway doesn't recognize this

185
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:26,940
device are going to exclude this device
from the network mode too and this is

186
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,170
another way I just did an alternate way
in case burger wrote for some reason but

187
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:35,030
proxy but if you go to the raspberry
website they give you all the commands

188
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,460
to run like how to turn devices on or
off so these are free on the interwebs

189
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,090
to who will how to turn devices offer on
or include a device via robbery commands

190
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,130
and that's how I got those commands so
this is currently in exclusion mode

191
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:59,090
waiting for the gateway to say hey
exclude me from the network right

192
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:06,850
see that worked alright one device on
the network right so it excluded from

193
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:14,760
the network but we need to confirm that
this this guy works in a dream world

194
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,290
sweet

195
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:28,970
awesome so just just to prove so it's
all added to the Gateway unplug the

196
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,470
Gateway take it off

197
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,420
you'll see that it's going to try to go
back to the apts which is this IP

198
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:44,410
address I'm not trying to access to win
it can cause its so you don't need to

199
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,600
maintain access device spectrum only and
you

200
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,590
house not for anything malicious to sit
outside and turn their lights on and off

201
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,410
to annoy them when they're watching a
movie or something that's that's what I

202
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:05,740
use it for so exactly exactly that
concludes my briefing there any

203
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,430
questions

204
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:14,630
Aspire are you can just google handheld
controllers are multiple ones this is a

205
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,700
little bit more expensive it comes with
a wall mount so you can use both this

206
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,050
ones like 30 bucks so I think anywhere
between twenty and a hundred bucks

207
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,930
depending on the cool thing about these
you could this can be your network so

208
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,700
you can just bring one of these home in
AD at individual devices obviously you

209
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,400
only have a local access to your device
or up to 20 2008 says 200 years but it

210
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,610
doesn't really go that far at least in
my experience it's just a device is your

211
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,900
portable controller and have local
access only
