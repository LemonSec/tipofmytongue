1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,740
imma go ahead and get started so
absolutely kinda in June beyond a major

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,309
put and beyond in there because I
definitely don't want to harbor

3
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:19,840
misconception that you can do everything
Anderson it's not sure 100% silver boy

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,279
it was meant to definitely accelerate
the process and automate a lot of the

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,080
things that you used to have to do
manually but there are some things that

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,189
we do above and beyond recon and g2 to
really build our open source

7
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,840
intelligence products and so that's why
that's why the and beyond is there and

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,450
of course I'm talking about applies to
application security so who am I on the

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,420
Managing Consultant over to visit so I
run all of our commercial services out

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,430
of envision we are software security
company that means mobile applications

11
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,250
web applications declined applications
all I kinda stuff so you're in need of

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,969
that type of service we certainly
appreciate if you would consider us to

13
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:05,640
be our consultants are looking up for
users by train

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,580
sometimes developers sometimes you guys
and then anybody that I listen to me I

15
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,890
love to talk and I like when people as
in other words a compartment near a lot

16
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,680
right tone I love Jesus and as you can
see also love my church shout out to new

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,210
spring in South Carolina pastor P Drive
mass and always recall I can never get

18
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,049
away with I'm that guy that I came off
last military the shares on the back

19
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,549
never get a warning I'm always walking
away with it to get so caught on live

20
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:41,390
demos ahead not as many as I wanted to
do simply because if I did I'd be about

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,759
four hours so as always my do you live
demonstrations with with those an

22
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,720
offensive it's early as possible and
while I don't condone it can prevent it

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,420
if I did I would be doing any demos that
would be fun so talk to know that I

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,460
don't look at recon angie is being a

25
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,950
children by one person managing the
color the framework but there are a lot

26
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,780
of people involved in contributing
modules and code and things of that sort

27
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,180
and this talk as an element of me
talking about these folks were involved

28
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,569
in that Brian fuhrman's actually here
sitting in the back Michael Hoffman's to

29
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,459
be clear I'm not sure he's been at the
Derby Conn this year but all these

30
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,340
gentlemen here including in the whole
offensive security group I'll talk more

31
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,459
about why a little while yet these boats
here in Mahalakshmi shot out because it

32
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:38,180
wasn't for them a lot of material that
would exist there you're talking about

33
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,010
US Attorney John on the last day changed
a lot and I've always talked about how

34
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,440
all these new technologies new resources
become available for us to harvest

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,430
information from and also my kind of
trajectory meant for years changed I

36
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,040
used to do a lot and that's where a lot
of this lawsuit was was geared towards

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,940
have since moved on to envision we're
now into an application security 100%

38
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,560
and so most of what i've talked
previously about a dozen has been kinda

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,260
related to net second I figured you know
I've had to come up with a whole new

40
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,810
methodology about how I approach open
source intelligence gathering now that I

41
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:21,269
am now that I'm not gonna share my
methodology and show people how I do

42
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,790
talk a lot of apps that are like you
know I'm source code or more fun doing

43
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,269
application scared I just don't see the
need for spending much time on a source

44
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,180
intelligence is ever going to answer
that question for you so what good is

45
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,519
the second set of the source code now
that's not always relevant but it is a

46
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,730
division because most of time probably
89 percent of our engagements we have

47
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:48,680
sourced we are a company that's bug
focus not looking for every similar

48
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,190
ability in the application not just the
ones that led us penetrate the

49
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,230
environment or penetrate to a specific
goal has been outlined for us in a

50
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,550
penetration test that's a legitimate
question

51
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,990
and often sent one thing are consumed
one thing right up front and at the

52
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,580
darker the assessment is the drain of
the need for more open source

53
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,680
intelligence know what I mean by dark
black box versus white box testing and

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,860
so the closer you get the black box them
more useful office open source

55
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,739
intelligence is going to be a but it's
not a zero-sum game because even even if

56
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:24,890
you're doing white boxer engine source
code analysis you can still use our

57
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,390
products to help show risk in the bottom
line is whether you doing a penetration

58
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:33,080
tester of our abilities whether you're
doing a dynamic test or source code

59
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,540
analysis the goal is the same ultimately
we want our client to fix problems in

60
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,200
coat but want to fix problems in their
applications so how do we do that when

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,610
we do that by showing risk the risk are
undergoing impact right impact is the

62
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,840
key to making intelligent risk decisions
on static analysis to change how we show

63
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,710
empower I we can still use those same
products along with vulnerabilities that

64
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,390
we find in code to show attack patterns
and say well as doctor can do this with

65
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,710
information they got here this
particular vulnerabilities of doesn't

66
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,980
necessarily show change our show impact
it just gives us more information right

67
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,080
actionable recommendations to now we
have coatings up a pass to fix your

68
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,550
problem with the idea is the same we
want people to fix bad code as a seminar

69
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,050
in the morning

70
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:35,720
somebody I'm super glad I have you seen
my peace talks you know that you know

71
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,690
our quite often approach as soon as part
of a float like I take over one piece of

72
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,540
information first and then moved on to
the next night transformed into

73
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,940
something else goes in a flow thing that
I've seen with when I'm collecting

74
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,760
information perhaps it's not so much a
flow of information

75
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,940
different categories of information that
I after and so there's not a specific

76
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,680
law you have to go in that were chasing
and so I've done here this particular

77
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,020
talk today talk about the different
categories of nation will talk about

78
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,460
what I'm looking for

79
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,510
why i'm looking for that specific
information and then we'll talk a little

80
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,810
bit about how I go get that information
and hopefully get some good image

81
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,840
missions in the first category of
information will talk about her contacts

82
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,360
so what am I looking for when talking
about contacts well usernames and e-mail

83
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,000
joyous and sometimes email addresses are
used and why am I looking at stuff well

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,510
they open up certain attack patterns
with an application security that I see

85
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,180
all the time

86
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,440
coming across in reports done by
Invision and reports done by other

87
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,720
consulting firms and those attack
patterns are as follows a user

88
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,010
flawed I've got college username well in
most cases are seen there's no there's

89
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,650
people do a collimation very very poorly
attitude typical problem solve and

90
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,740
policies we see that rampant everywhere
right and how many people many people

91
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,600
here do consulting engagements regularly
where where they they report we found

92
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,229
her policy every application and almost
need to be a template that started

93
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:15,229
building the report is back on its a
ballot problem or user to user names

94
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:20,640
opens at a top I guess a username and
they're not doing anything automation

95
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,490
properly

96
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,860
well there's a good chance we can guess
their password we do this quite

97
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,360
frequently to gain access authentication
access the application also what about

98
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,340
account lockout this is also another
difficult problem solving its rarely

99
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,510
done right

100
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,090
always it's typically done wrong if it's
not done right

101
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,669
users and you have an account lockouts
poorly

102
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,000
quite often I can result in what we call
a user-level denial of service

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,479
vulnerability righteous systematically
lockout accounts as a penetration always

104
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,940
do that the purpose of this is a way
that we can show your risk to the

105
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,580
organization

106
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:03,220
information well for those of you that
I've gotta some search functionality

107
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:08,400
built in there I'm actually gonna bounce
out we'll show you this walking through

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,590
briefly I just lost my place tonight

109
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:32,440
activist and 2 I'm going to Lotus not
sure data shows you that didn't stop

110
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:39,120
just stop shots your database enabling
time during the process to about 200 you

111
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,550
mess it up on a later when you're
running later module or something like

112
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:48,280
that when any case and you do like a
show modules you'll see that every

113
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,210
module has within its path

114
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,800
something along these lines what that
means is is the data that goes into the

115
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,160
module and the data that we're trying to
get out of the model so say you got a

116
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,010
new project or you're connecting against
a target and all you have is a domain

117
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,560
when you add the domain to the database

118
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,830
do it surged domain stats show you all
the models that take the domain as input

119
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,020
and then you can kind of see what you
gonna get out of it so say I want to do

120
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:24,000
have a domain so I do a search domains
that those are all the Recon modules

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,910
that start with domains a result
something else wellness contact right to

122
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:34,190
search desk contacts in letters dashes
before this time because we're trying to

123
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,860
get contacts and these are all the
models recon injury that results in

124
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,980
contacts so what couple that I'm
particularly interested in right now

125
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:56,490
well first sailed maple so what is sales
mobile homes before my previous talks

126
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,430
one of the original founders of boneless
read less to tell me in the past year

127
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,080
and what he did was he had this goal in
mind that you want to create a new

128
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,620
jigsaw for those you that didn't know it
was it was an online CRM that was

129
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,020
awesome for harvesting contact
information about people they were

130
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,930
converted over today 2.com under think
it was sales floors and then it's been a

131
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,209
game of cat and mouse on the transcript
or data indication wall and

132
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:29,110
just not been very broadly by sharing
data can't necessarily blame but we want

133
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,639
that data right well on this guy was
like that data should be free so he's

134
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,129
made it his goal to create a new jigsaw
for all that information is accessible

135
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:42,509
now including the email address so we no
longer have to try to build email

136
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:47,160
addresses office first names lasting
whatever email addresses are freely

137
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,910
available for sales maple sub let me out
of domain and I'm gonna go ahead and use

138
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:57,509
my church is a good target and they've
done a decent job of things up to know

139
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:07,480
when we embarrassed by me using them so
I can see you got one in their run it

140
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,100
seldom able to lay down you can see I
get first names like that last things

141
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,399
and then I get email addresses rights
not to build gmail.com nice so seldom

142
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,420
able something that I've added recently
it's definitely worth taking a look into

143
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:29,059
these things also like specifically said
I was security use this I'm not going to

144
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:32,899
build it up and it also put up a wall or
something that's going to be accessible

145
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:38,259
to the security community so I feel
pretty freely about about marketing he's

146
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:45,399
tough as nails tester tester is a module
that will call the email addresses for

147
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,139
you now that we have email addresses in
the system load male tester ronit you

148
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,910
actually go out using SMTP protocol and
DNS to make sure there's a mail server

149
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,990
there and talk to the mail server to
validate the email address actually

150
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,319
exist then it'll remove it from the
database if it doesn't so it's not a

151
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:05,809
perfect science did you can lock down
your mail servers to not respond tonight

152
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,259
give that information through SMTP but
in most cases it's been successful use

153
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,069
bring prevents this and so demoing it
will actually do us any good

154
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:18,619
scraping metadata from files in here is
overused is it

155
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:26,540
medical cell bill and a couple bucks you
basically what it does is it was like a

156
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:32,790
Google search and tries to enumerate all
the public-facing XLS xml-based and

157
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,670
totally based documents and PDFs that
are associated with the domain

158
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:41,230
edited out of them well the whole bunch
of dependencies romantic movie if you

159
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,390
are using polly's and it takes to set up
a built-in redundancy so let's load

160
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:52,890
medical aller and i doing them using a
smart alert feature that is awesome

161
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,430
videos lol medical all are in a good
show options here we see the source of

162
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,610
its use the same domain extraction set
to true will be set

163
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:10,000
extract to all and run it and rock
wickets extract a false to come back and

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,970
say these are all the documents found on
websites that are associated with a

165
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,320
particular domain pretty cool
information we can get from that lets

166
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,710
set extract to Drew and now I said
extracted shoreline now bridging the gap

167
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,650
from passive reconnaissance to active so
I wanna make that very clear

168
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,130
going to reach out to those web service
and pull down those files so now we're

169
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,600
actively touching the environment's an
important distinction to make by default

170
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,910
this module set the ball so that you
just see the vials I mean you can make

171
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,840
it to you can go out and grab them
yourself or you can use this model move

172
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,390
forward

173
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:48,100
make sure just remember it's not passive
a longer this point so run down the

174
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,300
files are distracting me to do

175
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,520
information you get from that quite
often user names actually used on the

176
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,660
internal systems quite often you'll just
get the names of the people so they

177
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,510
can't name versus the username you get
to computer name quite often on the

178
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,800
network that made the the software like
creating an idea what software the

179
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,620
running and inside so a lot of need
information that you get anywhere else

180
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,900
you can extract metadata with them files
and so basically yeah this is this is

181
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,110
what medical looks like I don't have it
storing anywhere into the database at

182
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,500
the moment simply because the three
different file types tho lax animal and

183
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,770
PDF file types on parsing they're not
consistent terms of the names of the

184
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,670
data fields and so right now I just
gotta bring out to the screen keyboard I

185
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,819
just put this together yesterday so yeah

186
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:48,899
I'm working out it's a work in progress
I was like you guys were enjoying the

187
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:55,399
party I was up in the room waiting for
the next information profiles and what

188
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,069
am I looking for here will social media
profiles public or private I'm doing

189
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:02,059
everything to social media something
like eBay site where you have a

190
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:07,529
public-facing profile just call it
social media and the public profile and

191
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:13,039
private still relevant because we can't
find them doesn't mean we can't connect

192
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,319
with them and then on privatized at
information access so prob public and

193
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:24,319
private social media profiles why well
some of those it opens up some other

194
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:34,189
time I like our our contacts did you
know a collimation done wrong or white

195
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:43,329
doesn't exist at all any type of reset
system often this type of folks here

196
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:49,759
running to invent a process is fairly
early I do what I mean by that is like

197
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,009
answer these questions and I'll send you
an email as quite often

198
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:01,779
case in point recently I was doing
assessment of a fortune 500 company just

199
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:05,889
operate under the porch of popular right
and they had a single sign-on portal for

200
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:13,639
everything everything they used in band
password security question and they also

201
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,979
had user numeration in the login page so
I was able to users go out on the

202
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:23,220
internet harvest some people just like a
done in previous previous demonstrations

203
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,589
and harvest invalidates users user
enumeration but when you validate user

204
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:33,489
obviously it's going to show you the
security the security questions they're

205
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:37,350
using like five or six random security
questions we found was that if you just

206
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,819
kept on asking for the same person
eventually get all their security

207
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:46,209
questions so I did after five or ten
people look at the security questions

208
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:52,089
that will be pretty easy to get high
school that I go to the name of my dog

209
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:52,930
workable

210
00:16:52,930 --> 00:17:01,850
56 keep requesting Angela asked me just
those two questions so down the basement

211
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,380
profile this person's profile went out
there started doing some harvesting sure

212
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:11,720
enough there is a better this elegant
doll's name what highschool did I go too

213
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,319
well

214
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,600
Facebook tells the mascot right and so I
just look at the high school band at the

215
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,890
mascot went back to the authentication
page a few times varying capitalization

216
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,990
eventually change the password right now
got access to she wasn't an admin to

217
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,860
once I got inside the system they have a
user lookup function we could look up

218
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:39,360
everybody else in the company guess
which was their username so then I can

219
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,500
see you with this guy is its name let's
go back to the password reset system and

220
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:54,030
do the same thing eventually I have you
got stuff happens you know this is Chris

221
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,280
gates or or robbery give talks before
that slowed up on absolute style right

222
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,000
that's what it is is most times you see
the ability to low not high high impact

223
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,710
would guess what theres back to change
together a profile gives us the ability

224
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:16,830
to do that so how we do this well a
couple of ways a LinkedIn com module and

225
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,590
that's all it was

226
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:25,070
I think somebody here mentioned it
earlier today he would use being

227
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:31,020
profiles and it would go to the profile
and it would go to others profiles

228
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,640
LinkedIn on the right hand side

229
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:44,000
others that you would call that we just
heard forty employer personal company

230
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,250
and then once it was done it would add
all those people to the contacts table

231
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:55,230
was like that's the one that wrote this
road original model as a hebron 1232

232
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:00,910
thinks now we can 2222 popular profile
stable let me take the profiles table

233
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,020
you choose crawling can get more
profiles and then just have a separate

234
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,840
models to call these profiles Herman
cossacks he's done all that work and I'm

235
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,030
tell me it is the most effective contact
harvesting method which in reality is

236
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:18,840
amazing views encourage it takes a
little while Tehran

237
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,220
more contacts than any other than any
other module shuttle model and framework

238
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:33,650
profiler named jack which you're like
user name of your handle whatever no

239
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:39,390
good like $136 resources and tell you
whether or not you're there

240
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:44,140
well alright we can go and say hey where
is this I got this particular target

241
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,880
where does this person have a profile on
the Internet

242
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,100
enumerate all the places ever profile go
their harvest information or profiler

243
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:58,059
does that for over 200 different sites
on his expand my web preacher expanded

244
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:04,480
the targets beyond just social media to
things like previously Madison and some

245
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,919
of the more unmentionable places that
are you certainly wouldn't want your

246
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,660
people have accounts at but he did that
because he's a threat intelligence

247
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,550
guides is really good resource to go
find information about where people have

248
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,770
profiles

249
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:35,480
talking about the guy in my class so we
show this to you really what is

250
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:53,010
obviously yeah you just like person's
name and you just drill down until you

251
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:58,300
have a list of everybody with that name
right and then you have a better profile

252
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,550
about this John hole in a guy that works
for me a bit of it is a division was

253
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,210
like

254
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,480
is awesome I start writing module around
this time it's still pretty buggy I

255
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,419
think one reason why the maybe they
haven't publicize it all that much as

256
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:19,480
cuz it's got some bugs in it but I'm in
the process of writing a module horrors

257
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,230
that you can just takes people's names
were whittled down as i hear all the

258
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,140
profiles associated with that name

259
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:35,539
pretty handy stuff ok here we go next

260
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:39,380
talking about look at pornex category
look at boris bridges and what about

261
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,860
china like breached data right but not
what I'm looking forward looking for you

262
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,720
rentals rock we all look for nationals
are using upon less damage it's amazing

263
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,919
the kind of information get out of that
details details important well their

264
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,299
important because we defined areas week
right if we know that a breach of the

265
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:03,770
company occurred because they had ramped
acetyl injection application developers

266
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,049
might have problems understanding the
how to code injection we can definitely

267
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:11,890
hone in on that and other applications
on the same domain or owned by the same

268
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:18,669
company and increases will wear those
important well uses rapid and also

269
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:23,669
pattern analysis of something came
across recently so you know you do

270
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:28,179
publicity see somebody last October
right had a password

271
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:34,789
capital Aug 14 like a month ago in July
what would you have guessed the password

272
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:44,740
anybody capital S U and 15 right and you
would have login as i'm ok so happens

273
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:52,270
all the time so you can use that
information and get in so how do we find

274
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:58,200
well searched all the modules that
assist you in those areas you will find

275
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,130
the full suite of phone the stock which
obviously acosta money will talk more

276
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,980
about that here in a little bit this
module right here is the one that just

277
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,029
kind of the guests know it doesn't cost
anything it's just a yes no it's been

278
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:16,490
it's been breached or has been seen in a
bridge loan stuff and from Troy hot

279
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:22,460
probably exposed this by now you can
search his briefs data and his face so

280
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,910
he's cataloging pay so much to replace
websites and allows you to search for

281
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,690
usernames email addresses in all of
these places well pretty handy tools

282
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,620
once again these things say yes or no
and then the baseball actually give you

283
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,140
a link to the pace another place you go
to see a little bit about breach details

284
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,190
privacy rights dot org

285
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,600
haven't seen as critical resource is
where I go to look at details about

286
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,840
breaches regularly updated on this a
little bit year as you can see the most

287
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,600
recent one that logs September 17 wasn't
all that long ago with the Kardash

288
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,760
website god help us all because look how
many people got hacked 660,000 people

289
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:10,140
have a balance on the Kardashian website
man we are going down the tubes be able

290
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:18,490
to end of humanity is near but charts
which uncle just say and you can get

291
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:23,600
information about that particular thing
about it is they get regular updates and

292
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,429
stuff like that so you can stay on topic
today with it and i also like to the

293
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:33,809
Krypton security are a good place to
harvest information about this and you

294
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,340
can actually go here in to search for
the organization

295
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,080
the company name on it it'll come back
and tell you that companies been seen in

296
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,929
a bridge somewhere so pretty handy
resource there another one is the one

297
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:51,150
company hacks interface that many cells
are built on his website basically just

298
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,620
goes out in such as Twitter or the name
of the company and then reached are

299
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:02,160
happy that is sometimes results are
unpredictable but but it's another

300
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,380
resource and of course are searching out
there using your search engines for

301
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,300
something else i'm looking for
technology I want to know about

302
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:15,830
technologies and why specifically for
specific service I technologies on a

303
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,929
framework for being use wanna know I
wanna know the server architectures

304
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:24,700
anything I can get from a third-party
resource about the underlying technology

305
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,320
is being used

306
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,960
outdated software so while his wife
technologies and port facilities other

307
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,370
doctors know once I have to manage
operations into an injection or once a

308
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:41,100
single injections really nice to know
what system actually inject into a so

309
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,539
that I can just meet with that payload
needs to be some end up with a false

310
00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:51,340
negative situation and talking about
direct quotations if you see what

311
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:56,710
version are using you got to see details
and go to exploit the TV Live exploit

312
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,159
code for it and then you may be able to
get access to that particular machine

313
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,350
without ever seen application without
ever having to go through the

314
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:07,570
application nothing is your server
server and client side trainers have all

315
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:13,169
of their own like vulnerabilities and
associated only the dotnet got a certain

316
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:15,620
set of antibodies that are only
associated with them

317
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,370
angularjs has an ability that are all
associated with angular and so he knew

318
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:25,279
the framework for dealing with you can
go specifically look for the abilities

319
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,950
how do I do this one start with bill
without com dot com the internet

320
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,710
constantly looking at heathers analyzing
survey responses in all kinds of

321
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,379
different stuff fingerprinting
fingerprinting server-side and

322
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:42,059
client-side technologies obviously the
code so it's really easy fingerprint

323
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,330
client-side stuff was being burned all
that stuff you just go there you search

324
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:50,860
for domain or search for specific cosell
tell you the information i've seen about

325
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,950
that particular about that particular
host of the place you look at job of its

326
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:01,299
ok used on the homepage of the website
as you can see here we have job openings

327
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:05,009
and envision so cheap kamagra quick look
for a job application security please

328
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:07,240
send us your resume we will have to talk
to you

329
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,570
party job sites savings I got resume
posting sites up like that obviously it

330
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,600
company access looking for elite PHP
developer well the problem running

331
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:28,159
Israel no least is busy bees like plane
of existence ok so what our bellies next

332
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,289
category information i'm looking for
what exactly am I looking for well live

333
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:36,769
exploitable vulnerabilities would not be
exploitable vulnerabilities without ever

334
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,220
send a package to the environment

335
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,780
source code leagues in things like use
troops in forum stuff like that and then

336
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,380
straight up searchable bugs are talking
expand want searchable bugs in a moment

337
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,960
but why is all this results in really
low or no effort level discovery so we

338
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,049
also don't work for us

339
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:57,500
somebody else's head scan the code
somebody else's and the dynamic public

340
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,980
facing website and maybe they discovered
some vulnerabilities and made them

341
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,750
search will just go out there and spoke
information and then BAM we've got we've

342
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:11,080
got seats available is a really quick
wins how do I go about doing that well

343
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,179
I'm full-body scanners right stuff like
most of you probably heard about this

344
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:20,990
point I'm their scan the internet for
web applications and on that basis for

345
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,720
his think they assert themselves a
certain field he's not doing too much in

346
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,549
terms of terms of DA Govs

347
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:33,220
to have in the past maybe now you can
just go there and i charge my domain

348
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,520
search facebook.com and you'll see our
values its tracking facebook.com last

349
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,909
time it's candid partisan false-positive
sure there's positives there it's an

350
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:44,270
application

351
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:50,270
the riddle positive right but you know
how to do things can somebody else

352
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,510
babysat the scanner somebody else I did
the works after weighted towards finish

353
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,280
durability

354
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,059
another train home project basically
what it does is it looks at dot net apps

355
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:06,750
from a 3rd party perspective just go
look at your sent a series of tests to

356
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,900
determine whether the applications
global to any of those dotnet specific

357
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,510
configuration also really useful tool
their 3rd party perspective of

358
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:21,590
vulnerability disclosure sites XSS was
around for a long time it has been taken

359
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,400
over by excess says those not really
sure why of all the data is also been

360
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,190
migrated over so if you see is access
access poses now the the resource for

361
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:35,039
that show their search for the domain
search for the hosts and see if

362
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,799
anybody's reported across as scripting
vulnerabilities that application domain

363
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,270
and of course there's donate kind of the
the hub for debasement you can always go

364
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,650
there and search as well

365
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,850
to see if anything on with your target
domain has been device

366
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,390
which definitely means whether there's
been some level of exploitation on that

367
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:56,690
particular server and so did you go
hunting or so how do we do this well

368
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:00,340
earthly concerns desperate buildings and
I see all the modules that you this

369
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,510
morning recon engine shutdown modules
will go out to the punch tighter and

370
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,030
extend exercise post searches for you
the other stuff

371
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:13,530
manually gonna be public place right in
its target I got it marked out that's

372
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:19,500
because we're testing testing any Uhde
or staging test environment maybe not

373
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:25,070
publicly but if there is a publicly
accessible version of the application

374
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,180
well then it can be seen by the status
ok that information may still be useful

375
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,530
and it still within scope because you're
not the one that's right the dangerous

376
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,280
out there you're going to get the data
about it so just because you're testing

377
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,850
in a restricted environment doesn't mean
that there's no information out there

378
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:48,090
you can use about the production version
of the applications of you that my so

379
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,320
what about dynamic portability so about
static or abilities goes back to that

380
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,230
searchable boxing out talking about how
much I find steady source code analysis

381
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:02,740
type of our abilities on the internet be
open source intelligence was some of the

382
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,900
papers of yourself up into a result is
really talk later called get Rob to get

383
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:13,120
up and basically what it does is it will
call you an organization's name it will

384
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,010
go to get all the repositories that
bloggers organization and a list of

385
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:24,540
filenames not gonna put out a list of
filenames and then it will look at all

386
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,210
the filename to see if there's any known
vulnerabilities associated files such as

387
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:36,020
underscore token Datar be right so
things like that really really cool idea

388
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:41,800
got me thinking we can take this further
is actually a modular framework only per

389
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,180
module that exists is the one that
analyzes file name but its extensible so

390
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,800
if you want to get involved in a project
something like this is maybe a good

391
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,350
project for you to contribute to another
really good place to look for bugs and

392
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:58,970
codes budged in code is a website called
search code and I've got it all up here

393
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,100
it's a fairly new project think it's
been maybe a little over a year now

394
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:08,250
there's filled with your search go but
you can it's doing is harvesting source

395
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,220
code from a budget of repositories you
see the list their get up big bucket

396
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,330
Google Code complex are supposed to Dora
and you can just go in and searched

397
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,700
right you search strings that are
associated unknown source code abilities

398
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,050
and framework your testing an app that
positive words public-facing well we can

399
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:30,450
begin to do source code analysis ever
having to pull down the codes most

400
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,380
people would say well I just put on the
code and analyser well what if your

401
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:42,910
target organizations got $250 I'd rather
just use a search engine that started on

402
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,330
all the indexing and have a search of
warming up so so these are these are

403
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:51,220
real real real approaches to how we can
do this kind of a funny thing I was

404
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,540
going through the get robbed code as you
can see down there what's he looking for

405
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:01,940
a particular snippet that particular
signature was very kind and she is

406
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,990
looking for a is looking for your API
keys file so that you pushed out like a

407
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:12,410
four of a kind you and your API keys and
find it using around I've done that

408
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,640
before you can go find it bizarre
rebasing higher-paid actually whited out

409
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,790
completely but I've done that before I
made that mistake we are all human we

410
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,890
make mistakes so that's another way to
do this is a man searching using either

411
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,720
give your Google or both

412
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,480
guy so we're talking right now God or
king is Google to working with an

413
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,970
accusing the Advanced search engine and
and so there's two different approaches

414
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:49,770
that we can switch W someone anyone
talking to nightlights so the other

415
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,350
student approaches to Dorking one we can
use advanced search or use Google's

416
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,950
Advanced search which this with the site
colon get hot dot com Advanced search

417
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,360
operator on there some advantages and
disadvantages to both have searched for

418
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,430
work so you can you file name you could
say I want to look for a pass are not

419
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,770
following the path you

420
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:16,290
as a sage / Idrus a which is as you say
public he's right I can search for that

421
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:22,730
if I just put that and hit enter
anything you need to strengthen their so

422
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,570
you have to restrain that will that will
be predictable show up in a particular

423
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,240
file every single time

424
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,429
more searchable abilities as a string
involved right so that's not really that

425
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,080
much of a headache but it is a
restriction

426
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,909
makes it a little bit hard to focus on
our targets were already using in

427
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:45,730
cycling yahoo.com only way to really
focus in on a targeted by knowing the

428
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,810
organization and by knowing the
repository name is in using the Euro

429
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,090
thing you see on the bottom line of the
slide there to focus on his superb

430
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,070
repository makes it a little more
cumbersome to find those vulnerabilities

431
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:03,100
are using Google doors on my call to get
when I get home through Google I just

432
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:09,170
kinda get dorks I'm not trying to
actually create a new word independent

433
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:15,450
dorks out there but they are more than
just right I mean we can do it for sight

434
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,540
but the dot com site source words dog
whatever is now it's been around forever

435
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,650
probably news there's no code blacks
there's a budget of resources there so

436
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:29,620
we're not just restricted to get the
results non-users reliable obviously

437
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,840
Google indexed upright so after changing
fairly regular in fairly quickly perhaps

438
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,920
Google has an index that yet so I have
found that the results of surging code

439
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,720
bar bilities through give up through
Google is less effective than just doing

440
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,300
it straight through the Advanced Search
Engine ok so while we do this well

441
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,920
search within the framework will show
you a couple new models we got minor

442
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,500
repose and again towards modules with
those do is get home I will go out the

443
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,230
organization names within the database
it'll blow down all the repositories and

444
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,320
all the developer profiles for that
organization that's absolutely key

445
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,690
places I start doing reconnaissance for
the sort of information is out wanna

446
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:19,370
know where the developer for files are
as a reminder that information what you

447
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,000
know when you go to say new spring that
Cece even though

448
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,960
they have a private organization
organizational access controls a

449
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,610
privatized lot of the repos you can
still see all the developers at her so

450
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,580
she knew that organization pulled out
all the profile because it will be

451
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:38,820
useful here in a bit then take all of
the profiles of profound the profiles

452
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,930
table and it will go down all the
repositories under this profiles which

453
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,780
includes both the ones associated with
the organization and also the ones not

454
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,150
associate with just the wall the ones I
belong to that particular person once

455
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,900
again we're starting to expand our
footprint here and they get hot dogs

456
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,280
will take all of the repository
harvested and run those search strings

457
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,040
against them

458
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,540
ok right now got a small file and
therefore forgive forget the sky like

459
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,100
six or seven different searches in there
but something that is a community we can

460
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,940
start to build I just I went I just come
through Google on the internet trying to

461
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,130
find all the ones that people have been
tweeting and talking about hunting

462
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,770
articles about over the past few years
just collected those but obviously

463
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:27,820
there's room for expansion there so very
very powerful year the next thing I'm

464
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,660
after is a master sensitive information
we haven't completely left the the gift

465
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,950
of stuff yet after debugging information
any type of device information that

466
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,530
developers left somewhere

467
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:43,450
development notes made it doesn't
development let's note somewhere out

468
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:50,680
there on the internet and configuration
so probably saying internet and well you

469
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,660
explain why you're just a minute but how
here in just a minute because they do it

470
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,850
completely on accident actually pretty
funny I'm so why

471
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,850
well obviously we can learn about the
private repositories information we see

472
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:07,230
in public areas of theirs debugging at
this dividing notes about them debugging

473
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,340
and internal or an application that's
hosted an internal positive or we can

474
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,590
begin to learn about that particular
application and then of course you

475
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,150
configure and the whole reason for doing
out of an configuration storage because

476
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:23,290
they don't want to push her tonsils to
the code repository and so obviously

477
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:28,200
within that we have possibly secret keys
possible API keys of our party API's

478
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,640
things of that sort system pretty darn
sensitive information

479
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,100
how do I look behind in peace and that's
really hard for those of you that dude

480
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,870
that used to try to search space as a
part of your OC methodology you know

481
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,540
that those things are like the actual
search capability built in place

482
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:49,210
websites is like a flicker in time as I
searched the past three hundred and that

483
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:54,800
was about 90 seconds were so hot and
you're continually scraping apologized

484
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,280
catalog all the space darn near
impossible to search Q late that's

485
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,670
really hard to used to search based upon
information but we have just under

486
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:12,710
people here use just one guy she
probably you probably know about what

487
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:17,710
I'm talking about when I get to this
others liked it so let's treat them like

488
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:23,460
paced by developers are operating within
the context of get home and give it has

489
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,910
this really neat feature I can put
debugging information there I can put

490
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,620
configuration information information
there and share with the other

491
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:35,770
developers why would I use that
third-party waste paysite well I don't

492
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:40,420
blame you for using it all but the key
is the gift doesn't allow for

493
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:45,320
organizational just right so your
organizational accounts cannot create

494
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,200
adjusters don't just associated with it
was mean which means all of the athletes

495
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,310
controls that come with having
organizational cow don't protect any

496
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:59,970
just saw the just and injured by the
fall so in that developer dozing creates

497
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,470
Egypt based on sensitive information
about application that just goes there

498
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:12,340
public-facing account and by god I found
so many sensor credentials sensitive

499
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:18,630
information all the stuff debugging API
keys and stuff in June just simply by

500
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:22,300
harvesting all those developer profiles
going to each one of them clicking on

501
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,970
just seeing what's there and developers
don't realize that when they're

502
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:33,000
operating within the private access
control restricted repository say

503
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,210
created just about this just goes to
their public profile

504
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:41,590
by the whole again so that's definitely
something you want to start looking out

505
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,110
and what do we do able to just down
there we just are searching for key

506
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,820
words and words are you want to search
for here our stuff like anything that

507
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,400
you would search for say if you don't
post exploitation on a machine right

508
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,650
we're looking for passwords were looking
for

509
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:00,660
on database connection strange looking
for maybe just demands actual commands

510
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,060
on a fan on things that sort

511
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:07,730
a lot of time you look for you just go
strolling through the look at them but I

512
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:13,490
like when I use with Recology
modularized down in their research that

513
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:18,420
will take all of the just so when you
actually do the repo marginal

514
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:25,480
profiles impulse allergists to this will
go through this module go through in

515
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,900
search of those just a solid keywords
that you give it very very powerful

516
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,060
definitely check it out

517
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,680
ago lacking database we've all heard of
this before right

518
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,380
watching Google Dorking do for us as you
that a mess with this new public had to

519
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:45,310
do it manually because the tools that do
it in a fashion no longer exists a

520
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:49,560
leadoff double stuffing it's really neat
error messages double whole bunch need

521
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,940
information contacts live
vulnerabilities that they're running

522
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,430
something that's that's searchable a
credentials files as we saw in the

523
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:02,060
medical or marginal all kinds of neat
stuff and the whole on sources for dorks

524
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:06,120
right i mean you've got a database which
is hosted by the office of security guys

525
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,730
used to be hosted over John along
website

526
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:15,950
anonymous they published their supply
list a couple years ago trust actually

527
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,280
going on download that thing it's out
there you can grab it that's an

528
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,640
interesting set of dorks to look for
single injection of the Google dorks all

529
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,530
the different doors that are out there
that you get leverage Google and then of

530
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,480
course custom lists right on I've got my
own custom list of application security

531
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,290
focused towards that I use when I go out
I search for them but not limited to

532
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:41,700
just google right we use in being Yahoo
in a lot of different places

533
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,830
ominous also being hacking database
available from the bishop Fox folks that

534
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:48,450
do the research degrees but guess what

535
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:55,130
mastered own Google I got the Google
hacking working within recond something

536
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,030
I've wanted to do since I started
building this out three years ago

537
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:03,760
whatever as anybody's ever tried to
scrape who knows it's hard like they do

538
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,710
a lot to prevent third parties from
scraping their content but I found a way

539
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,609
to do it

540
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:12,599
ok I'm not gonna go in all 12 details
about how I do it because out there who

541
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:18,470
want to take a look when I got drunk and
searched ok gotta do a got a model that

542
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:24,849
at the base model and it will go out and
it will take all these Google dorsal

543
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:28,329
situated with the domain so that you're
targeting you're actually targeting your

544
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:32,730
scope and will respond with all of the
different hit again you probably asking

545
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:41,780
by the box and you get by the caches
well but we demonstrate so going on here

546
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,540
let's load the Google database and right
off the bat is on a good show you the

547
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:53,700
options for the better I mean bumping up
to the top two people back in sea ice on

548
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,550
media Italy you'll see that they got a
whole list a different kind of course

549
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:02,650
here so what it does is an and God bless
the folks they managed to maintain it

550
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:10,859
they put in all the overhead you take
the submissions and they provided to

551
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:15,660
provide access to that to me as an open
source project as some of the other

552
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,390
products that I can build this thing so
deftly huge shout out to the offensive

553
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:25,790
security guys in months and particularly
what I do is I entire database upgrade

554
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,750
all of the different doors into
categories and so on a search for all

555
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:35,339
like $3,700 reach them and take you may
want to focus on one particular area I'm

556
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:42,430
so let's say I want to just search for
error messages so I can see each day

557
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:42,920
today

558
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:50,470
error messages to truces to set up like
an hour surgery just those things up at

559
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:54,190
the top if you want to use your own
custom lest you just set dorks to the

560
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,869
path of the file and you'll ignore all
the Google database stuff and you

561
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:01,890
shirtless guys here

562
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:08,980
her messages and it'll do it for the
demands by go-ahead run longer so

563
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,710
connected to the Internet

564
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:29,900
let it go and google like okay not a
human lie I give them a little while ago

565
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,700
a couple weeks ago and liked it took
like three runs for Google highly say ok

566
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:45,510
you're about so long as I'm basically
what you're going to see eventually

567
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:50,150
you're going to see my just top flip
over an image pop up on the screen and I

568
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:54,530
will be the capture and what recon and
she gives you the ability to do is enter

569
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:58,340
the CAPTCHA within the framework it will
communicate with Google to receive your

570
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:12,310
emeritus so there you see you capture
any takers for this isn't working

571
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,960
probably be completely ruined it by
talking about it but that looks like he

572
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:31,430
s ILS and her actually gets faster so I
get the cookie I guess I am human from

573
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:41,070
Google not pass that could be ok so I go
gangbusters on this a lot faster when

574
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:47,570
you're not over like two bars of
eighties but you can see his right mind

575
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:56,640
cannot modify header information one of
these things we do to the website or

576
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,140
something to possible vulnerabilities so
this stuff works on one thing I notice

577
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:08,400
is to be able to do this forever to come
back and noticed that the more difficult

578
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,299
to capture the longer the Camorra
question again

579
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:27,640
like this one right here on this now
because I think you should see how it

580
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,689
works pretty cool stuff I'm super
excited about this it's been an awesome

581
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:37,619
capabilities trying to build into this
for a long time and finally here so some

582
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:45,369
final thoughts on this long time since I
last talked to all the cool stuff then I

583
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:50,749
guess what is well guess what this is
done today free right in fact the only

584
00:47:50,749 --> 00:47:55,839
thing you need to do is get an API key
produced nothing everything I do it for

585
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:02,099
40 cents application security obviously
pulled down 10 JAL's gonna cost money

586
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:07,079
but everything else done today hun Sen
free doesn't cost you and that's that's

587
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:15,369
really cool internet for these advanced
search that searches and stuff like that

588
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:18,999
you've got stuff that you use on a daily
basis are things you used in the past

589
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:22,549
please tell me expand the list you can
e-mail them to me or you can send them

590
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:26,479
to us pull request out of the framework
either one works however you get it

591
00:48:26,479 --> 00:48:31,819
seems fine air once again ciao ragazze
offensive security for maintaining

592
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:36,910
providing access to the database also
allow me to make a regular request for

593
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,439
to keep it updated so every time you
shop new updates refine gee you're

594
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:44,549
getting updated version of the Google
database and also what I now something

595
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:50,390
new and I just got permission to
announce this of the past 24 hours of

596
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:56,569
service and it said look I can't afford
as a boutique individual that has

597
00:48:56,569 --> 00:49:00,890
clients I can't afford to get all of the
API access required to do a lot of

598
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:05,869
things that you do and so as a private
contractor I'm gonna start providing

599
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:09,769
that as a service to folks so and you
want somebody to do all the Reconquista

600
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:11,650
for you

601
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,640
contract with me and as a consultant
also go through couple hours to all the

602
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:21,479
OC are you filled out the work space
station from their kind of making some

603
00:49:21,479 --> 00:49:25,719
of that more expensive stuff accessible
to everyone doing in a way that I feel

604
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:26,350
is

605
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:33,730
is ethical without without reaching any
other founders so come up to me
