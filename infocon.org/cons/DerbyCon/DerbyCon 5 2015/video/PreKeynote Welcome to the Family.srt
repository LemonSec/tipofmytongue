check your scope

38
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,580
the same time thats yeah but you know we
all became really good friends after

39
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,940
that year and Adrian end up putting on a
display class out here and we decided

40
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,400
hey you know you know let's talk a
little about with class and I think he

41
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,380
wanted original 25 people or something
like that

42
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:03,140
signed up something showed up in
Sohrabuddin this dive pizza place to

43
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,650
place into afterwards like many people
to call the start of conference we all

44
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,940
start talking about it and nobody's
james Murdoch on the way back and

45
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,920
literally or something I'm going to a
conference may do a conference and so

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,010
you know the first thing is yet to break
that news to the person that's basically

47
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,989
running the conference

48
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:23,790
you know and so you know it gets a deal
with the afterwards there like here that

49
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,919
we started congressman newman she's like
let's go let's do it

50
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,860
ok great and so we don't know what that
meant you know the first year we need

51
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,150
four hundred people to balance out to
get over a thousand house when those

52
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,660
things we like it no one shows up we're
totally screwed financially but we gotta

53
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,039
figure it out anyway so working out and
I we really wanted to do was bring a

54
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,229
conference the folks that that has a
good vibe to it so we all kinda come

55
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:48,780
together and learn from each other and
you could see that downstairs yesterday

56
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,120
right i mean everybody was downstairs
there is no groups or clicks or anything

57
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,830
like that we're just hanging out having
a good time drinking beer and then a lot

58
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,470
of us migrated over to third Street dive

59
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,260

else that was going on

60
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,820
videos of that we have videos of naked

61
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,340

88
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,840
big party tomorrow

89
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,319
obviously running a little inebriated
and a little bit probably an

90
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,639
understatement but you know be kind to
one another don't you know people that

91
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,539
don't wanna keep in touch you but i dont
wanna be tied down how people don't you

92
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,440
know be courteous of space and I get
stuff we will enforce that we have to

93
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,430
enforce that just remember here to have
fun with that except getting a hundred

94
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:05,770
horses and ultimately you know learn you
know my goal and I came here is the

95
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,030
twenty people I meet women's when people
try to think that every year at twenty

96
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,250
people needs and that's kind of a goal
that I set to continue to learn not from

97
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,620
folks that come out there

98
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:30,830
chief of staff that's amazing

99
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:40,329
alcoholic beverage the parties and
giving us free drinks already becoming

100
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:46,490
the taunting on Twitter about the wars
you know I know his last year's the

101
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,770
impenetrable you know for sure if you
remember but you know they they're great

102
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,589
staff they treat us well they really try
to accommodate everything we do but

103
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:57,170
they're they're really great I'm just
remember here no clicks no groups can go

104
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,630
to anybody if you want to meet somebody
go talk to them that's what it's all

105
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,570
about here to learn from one another
because we're all the same when it comes

106
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,420
down to interesting enough on Derby Conn
and you know the financially but

107
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,850
literally what we do is we have sponsors
that support you know that the

108
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,339
conference itself we have you know the
ticket as we have each raining pieces

109
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:23,089
and usually we end up around with around
$350,000 off the whole company seem like

110
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,620
a lot of money and it's great

111
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,640
we pay trainers and hotel and everything
else attacks as I go along with that

112
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,050
usually the end of the year we have
around $60,000 left and then after taxes

113
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,340
and hotel paper next year we usually
have zero that so every year we use a

114
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,210
break even we put all the money back
into the next year to make it better and

115
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,600
better as you can see we have multiple
bands this month we've improved a lot on

116
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,610
everything that we're doing as far as a
conference were trying to get better and

117
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,060
better every year and do things album
manageable this isn't a money thing for

118
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,340
us it's just the thing that we do to
have a lot of fun with one another just

119
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,180
you know what's your account of
recharging party here with all her

120
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:04,980
friends and so the financial strength

121
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,300
challenge a couple years ago a trend and
actually got a black badge on it but we

122
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,520
demonstrate really quick

123
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,060
the ice challenge what this means of you
estimate comes up to the Smirnoff Ice

124
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,580
obviously be 21 or older but if someone
gives you a Smirnoff Ice you have to

125
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,340
check into it right there and you get a
smirnoff ice tricoat throughout this but

126
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,720
then that's kind of the basic principles
by somebody else to demonstrate this

127
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:46,960
week with chris Christie ago

128
00:10:46,960 --> 00:11:03,080
what he's doing right there so they
literally haven't gotten my baby

129
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,070
now some creative folks deviance and
granting a lot of other folks created

130
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,250
these things called ice medics which
last year hit him up and so it actually

131
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,630
comes out the other employee now so you
see these folks walking and they may be

132
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:26,130
able to save you so our goal is to not
literally usually doesn't take this long

133
00:11:26,130 --> 00:12:07,970
you do know that let me hold rating
older so this year you can go over

134
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:17,660
you'll see these white man nice 2015 was
nice enough to sponsor this and it's too

135
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:23,280
bad man that's why we change them it's
part of the game so I actually like it I

136
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:30,050
was going to ice I would need more than
two bands have to give her a nice plus

137
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:36,640
three so it's you know it builds on
itself to its a fun game and actually

138
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,700
there are some ice on some chairs here
so you guys find it yeah yeah take that

139
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,600
and I someone there's one over here to
someone in that chair you got it

140
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,130
meet with someone turn around and I
someone finds someone over there how do

141
00:12:53,130 --> 00:13:00,980
you get such bad response at the hackers
are you go for five bucks every year

142
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:07,949
every year we raised more money than any
other conference does so maybe everybody

143
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:28,959
has a lot of people who have I known as
well as many others get some ice is I

144
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,899
somebody

145
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:37,790
neighbor as yourself

146
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:46,329
looks tempting ago how how warm is it

147
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:53,410
speakers so if someone actually speaking
in your ice them that's like one way

148
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,689
that the speaker will always remember
you so you get a nice and your Isis

149
00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:05,290
speaker they will never forget you
remember Chris in a USB believe today so

150
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:11,329
what time schedules that's one thing
that the agency has improved in the

151
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:16,740
vendor area if all the proceeds go to
charity foundation of johnnie where you

152
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,380
at johnnie hear johnnie johnnie probably
still sleeping when I get a negative

153
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,259
rating agency is really great
organization where johnnie teaches

154
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:32,449
Uganda technology and everything else in
all the proceeds go to Johnny's funds to

155
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:35,949
be able to use these out there said you
got there by stuff a lot of great things

156
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,769
from the auctioning out there definitely
check it out

157
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:46,649
one thing and I know when there's a
mention is the schedule is on the indy

158
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:50,069
handout that changed little bit big make
sure to use the one in the website that

159
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:53,649
is your go-to you to make sure that all
the talk to you want to go to there we

160
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,490
had some switcheroo

161
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,949
could make it matter to you but some of
the schedules have changed a little bit

162
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:03,059
so be sure to check the schedule online
that is your

163
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:06,759
we're going to TV outside that has the
schedules listener to see kind of go to

164
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:20,149
that one as well as got you there where
mud flap how we doing everyone which

165
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:27,389
known since 2007 they were gonna do this
conference that's their responsibility I

166
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:33,939
need some help from anchorage is what
helped us we want to do is sit here I've

167
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:41,879
never done a CTF I've been to DEFCON
I've never participated I guess what is

168
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:48,939
that about the figured out that was a
bad choice it was at how I never never

169
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:52,919
act that way doing like we gave
yesterday mccade be a good idea of you

170
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,889
screaming and then like that I just to
be different because we're gonna live

171
00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:01,479
streaming out going to do it or not
there to make this happen but I promise

172
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:06,629
the world that are delivered no pressure
or anything so what we do have no idea

173
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:12,459
to start researching it never played on
decided to do my own way

174
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:18,279
depend tell us what we need a we need to
score board we get one of those I don't

175

know I'm a former web developer so I
made one nice nineteen nineties colors

176
00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:29,299
here we are five years later and see
sure other schools that have been used

177

for a long time and we've revamped
scoreboard we now have a public score

178
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,779

179
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,049
scoreboard

180
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:47,449

them off at all the work that which is

209
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,310

212

events outside house make sure you check
the Events page at on the website as

213

the handout is it would be showing

214
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:58,610
hackers the movie tomorrow Saturday at
7:15 p.m. and that'll end right before

215
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,360
the party starts but notice there is
limited availability doing in the

216
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,430
theater in which has about you know
seating for about a hundred people are

217
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,980
so so you know get there early if you
wanna see anymore publish showed again

218
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,020
afterwards are licensed licensed it to
be able to view it here we can only show

219
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,470
it tomorrow so might do another showing
of it depending on the timing but we had

220
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:26,070
the licenses from the NBA and I was good
ones to be able you got so one big item

221
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,290
of news that we're contemplating and I
want to show you this really quick here

222
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,600
in and what I want a caddy at this with
is that this is something that works

223
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,120
were contemplating doing to send a
questionnaire to the audience only one I

224
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,540
can spend anything but whether or not we
should use this is completely up to you

225
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,970
as an audience as it was kinda tends to
decide but one thing you notice is that

226
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,550
Derby Conn sold out in about two weeks
notice that I mean there's literally

227
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,600
sold out two weeks which a lot of folks
can be here because of that we're

228
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,080
contemplating expanding

229
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,929
the conference a little bit and
obviously we can't do that here in this

230
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:04,399
space but we don't have one of the
highest we never will so one thing I can

231
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:08,669
say is that we're looking at possibly
doing a combination of the conference

232
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:13,490
here and at the Marriott now before
every three something like that kind

233
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,289
that's not the case

234
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:19,019
rolling expand a little bit to kind of
be able to get more species do more

235
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:24,340
things to make more space wise you know
the Jeopardy you know what's going on

236
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,470
tonight have seventy people in it you
know i will like to be able to expand

237
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,100
that more and have more room to do more
but i wanna show you a quick walk real

238
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:42,460
quick and how long it takes to get there
is no bigger just once you walk through

239
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,380
what we're planning on doing the goal is
to always stay here but there's a lot of

240
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,960
folks that want to come in and i cant so
our plans are we want to get up in time

241
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,169
and transparent but her thinking about
something but in a conference between

242
00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:05,419
and Mary are not familiar with a really
fast walk with you to show you how long

243
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:08,610
it takes to move from one place to the
other and the goal would be to have

244
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:16,490
talks and tracks their own kind of
spaced out a little more room

245
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,730
talks he wants you and also maybe just a
little bit more folks that wanna tender

246
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:29,549
let's go for a walk on mir

247
00:22:29,549 --> 00:23:19,139
very familiar that's how I got air
conditioning any good morning rather not

248
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:47,890
think about that do the walk going to
treat you right

249
00:23:47,890 --> 00:24:00,080
as be able to start to finish just three
minutes and 34 seconds at it as a casual

250
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,430
walk to get from here

251
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,590
those reinvent their over to their so
contemplate it think about it it's

252
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,040
something that we don't want to do is a
conference and we want to get our our

253
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,920
goal isn't to turn this into a massive
conglomerate conference we don't want

254
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,720
that at all

255
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,570
we also don't want to experience that
you folks come to you every year it's

256
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,730
also go away and also there's a really
good at sharing this put that up you

257
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,190
know is there things downstairs that you
know I don't get to hang out with you

258
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,810
know how it will always be our tour here
we always have the majority of stuff

259
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,700
here also want to be able to have more
things I'm kind of used to track their

260
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,900
two tracks over here and then you can
draw the stable rooms mixed abrams much

261
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,030
larger is my favorite tracks to go to
you on so just different things to

262
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,400
consider so think about it just
something that we're kind of

263
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,420
contemplating last but not least have
fun obviously we're here to learn to

264
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,900
have fun and to you to meet one another
and kind of just want to thank everybody

265
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:56,120
again for coming out here out you may
not be possible without Aaron which

266
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,660
basically is the glue that holds us all
together he talked to any of us I mean

267
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,660
that literally we are the most awesome
imagine a conference calls and get back

268
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,410
to doing something here

269
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:12,360
calls about Aaron the calls like seven
hours and seven schools so eric is

270
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,380
altogether she does all the planning
behind it but Martin with all of the ABA

271
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,640
and everybody else we have behind here
in Egypt the video recording and David

272
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,830
and creepy doing everything great in the
background on making this thing happen

273
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,650
is just the staff here again round of
applause for everybody makes their

274
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:37,820
become possible speakers everybody
behave and have a good time are right

275
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,890
next door coming up here for the Keno to
give us about three to five minutes

276
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,420
against up here and there will be up for
doing great time
