1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,370
I'm giving you the run gentleman

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:09,010
outstanding thank you so much guys for
coming you're here for 20 dropped reason

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:15,349
beer free tools to everyone and that
really you might ask yourself why we do

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:19,720
this the reason why we do this is
because we are center com we're a group

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,789
of penetration testers based on a
proforma waukee reveal Wisconsin and we

6
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:29,730
we rely on tools that probably some of
you have written every single day and so

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,850
you know we use tools like their babies
who like Metasploit power split you know

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,820
a whole bunch of tools if you were just
taking time to write and because of that

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,640
this is our just want to give back a
little bit you're not going to see any

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,450
outstanding slides we have no wonderful
visuals other than to simply I run

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,090
through a few demos put up some get rid
of some links and what you guys have

12
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,489
added it and we're going to try and cast
a broad net my broad net I mean we're

13
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,180
going to you

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,820
idemo some red team tools were going to
come up with some new team tools and

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,269
really all of these scripts because it's
they are not releasing any outstanding

16
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,030
sexy frameworks that are extensible
really is meant to be download put an

17
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,600
argument run it and you get some stuff
back that's really all this is so we

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,140
believe in simplicity so like I said we
don't slide deck and we might not have a

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:26,650
laptop but we have a spare one thing
that we're going to demo first

20
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:47,710
no way anybody see that yeah it's cut
her boy ok two minutes he says so

21
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:56,140
360 walk into a bar kit hey I'm gonna go
down there

22
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:11,850
I'll give you an idea real quick while
he's working that out a year ago yeah

23
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:16,090
everybody see that back I I hope you can
give an idea of what that what we're

24
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,690
gonna talk about anybody here were
connected directory or go policy ok

25
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,570
quite a few

26
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:29,840
Nessus users also hopefully you guys
going a lot of Redeemer's lutein

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,720
alright and people are employed only
about 25%

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,670
ok so what we're gonna talk about first
is that I wrote called about GPO

29
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,610
langston where this originally started
ways I guess they were penetration

30
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,080
testers but that's not all we do so if
we go in and we are an organization and

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
we tell me you got these weaknesses what
they might do is say is hired to come

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,390
back and actually try and fix some stuff
so that's exactly it happening in one

33
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,390
company or where they brought us back in
and i was looking over their Group

34
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,100
Policy Objects in any did a really quick
fast way of interrogating and it had

35
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,910
like a hundred and fifty GPO is not like
I don't know what the security settings

36
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,560
are I don't know if your security or
insecure I have no idea and I only had

37
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,200
about four hours to work this through so
what this is just a simple powershell

38
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,739
script that you run it against a group
policy exports so before we actually

39
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,769
kick this off if you are and and eighty
administrator you should post we are

40
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,459
familiar with the PowerShell command
lets one of those commandments is I

41
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:36,400
think it's get CBO report DPR report you
export this to XML ok so what this

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:46,430
script does is it takes and an XML
import and in and enhance my poor guy

43
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:54,860
under the under the microscope here no
no began passing exit this text file

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:13,230
and here comes before we actually the
only arguing that the stakes is the XML

45
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,049
file that you exported just previously
so going take it off and also gonna do

46
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,480
is I hope you can see this you can
establish through it

47
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,120
what's happening right here is that it
is parsing through all of the Group

48
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,360
Policy Objects that it found in the XML
file and then it basically spits out

49
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:38,010
this text file so that file no no no its
power showing you can count herself so

50
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,419
anyways what would you get your school
all the way to the top if you don't mind

51
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:47,280
so if you can't see this I i apologize
let me actually talk you through this

52
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,500
what it's going to do is that gonna spit
out the security settings network

53
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,310
security do not store manager has value
and XPath change and that's the true and

54
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,350
then what what it's demonstrating here
this is actually the default domain

55
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,570
policy it showing you that it's linked
to the top level 0 youjizz.com and the

56
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,200
ear stands for enabled because you can
have linked policies but the disabled so

57
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,930
in this particular case is disabled link
that's for DND scroll down a little bit

58
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:17,080
and here's where I created a test policy
called test Windows Server 2012 are two

59
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,180
you see all the various security
settings set to false the actual value

60
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,240
that they're said to scroll the way to
the bottom intellectually tell you if

61
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,960
that policy is enabling not and then
finally this is one thing that drives me

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,229
nuts if you're working in a huge
environment and you got hundreds or

63
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,520
worse thousands of GPO objects and you
inherit this demand I talk to a lot of

64
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,130
people who they get hired on as an 80
Minister and the inherent demeanor like

65
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,229
I don't know don't know what security
singer said I have no idea so this

66
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:48,550
lecture is this a known you just told
you you have GPS that are not used at

67
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,700
all and probably be back to me so I
guess that really simple not an not a

68
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,590
massive framework that this is but it's
just something that is handy if you're

69
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,650
an 80 administrator if you just hear
domain or worse you wanna get a little

70
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,360
more insight into your Group Policy
Objects thats exactly this is far so

71
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,510
good so how about a red team to all

72
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:12,230
so in this particular case we're gonna
talk about a 20 that one of my coworkers

73
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,730
are ok see this we we have a video for
this demo no reason being is because

74
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,120
there there's a little more intimacy
today to the test environment that we

75
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,530
didn't really want to get into so what
this is is a pure PowerShell memory

76
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,200
scraper and what the memory scripture
does is that it takes a goal kick off

77
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,180
the beer what this does is you you are
this would be a post textual so you have

78
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,670
command control

79
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,950
composite you have command control on
your system and you are running this

80
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:45,000
power show scripts and you it takes one
argument actually in this particular

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,560
case we're passing in Proc

82
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,760
and I explore so what this means is that
if you suspect that credit cards me to

83
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,640
run through Internet Explorer handy for
testing banks credit unions stuff like

84
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,480
that if you're on a teller machine
perhaps then you passing a process we

85
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,410
suspect credit card information is being
handled so what this is going to do is

86
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,020
all this is doing is simply running out
many dumped from power split so it's

87
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,660
going to you

88
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,600
performance out meet up against the
process that you pass in going running

89
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,070
and it's going to you start scraping
those files so this but in this case

90
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,390
case he's taking a credit card there's
actually no credit cards don't get

91
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,350
excited he's taking one of his credit
card he's running it through MagTek

92
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,930
stripper its populating out a mag text
test website and its going to scrape

93
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:43,560
that data once it's easy getting pulled
in and the magic marker process dumping

94
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,370
scraping looking and then write about
and we wait I'm gonna sit here and get

95
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,660
to know each other there is so track
data was right there

96
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,320
Casey Cammalleri that's actually the
sole credit card number like I said so

97
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,520
that's that's another very very simple
scripts that you sOooo and it runs in an

98
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,660
infinite loop and was doing just clean
up effort so there's no time left on

99
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,950
desk so if you're very very concerned
about OPSEC chances are this Windows or

100
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,050
if you have some kind of defensive

101
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,930
I can imagine a place that are actually
looking for some files are things being

102
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,650
written to disk it will pick this up
obviously however one of the really evil

103
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:31,889
switches to that script is said log so
you can actually do is you can put in a

104
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:35,820
web server and and or something
listening on port 80 and it will

105
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,820
actually pass code the pan data base 64
encoded and then send a request with

106
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,620
that data is your web-server so if you
decide to do this we recommend not doing

107
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,899
cross the internet posted back to a
certain that you have a network

108
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,540
otherwise their species problems and go
to jail so let's let's not do that so

109
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:02,709
next 20 that we're gonna talk about this
is 40 unisys users one thing so in our

110
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,950
organization we're unnecessarily
likenesses degree 20 however one of the

111
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,570
problems that we have for that we had is
when we would run messes and we would

112
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,620
let's see we're doing a vulnerability
assessment we're doing it on you know a

113
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,550
hundred or a thousand sheen's we're
gonna get back a ton of vulnerabilities

114
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,350
again with Iran's Nexus internally
chances are you understand this you're

115
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,459
going to see a lot of vulnerabilities me
ranging criticality and so when we do

116
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:31,890
this as as penetration testers we we're
lacking a way that we could take this

117
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,329
massive Nessus file that we get and
handed over to them in any way it's

118
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:40,990
going to be consumable now you can
export to HTML from NASA's and that

119
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,760
that's good but it's makes it difficult
to copy and paste it's not the most

120
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,450
readable usable formats least not in our
opinion so we want to give a little more

121
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:54,160
value add to our customers so we created
tool was completely complaints reporter

122
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:02,970
or VCR for short so we have problems we
we just the tracking and to people who

123
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,450
are thirty years or older

124
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,870
in this particular case so you run Nexus
and you going to necessarily export your

125
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,320
file into a.net this format all a.net
this file is just XML under the covers

126
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,520
that's all it is okay so you actually
run this in this case run against a file

127
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,090
for Acme corporation you actually can't
see some of the arguments here I

128
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,630
apologize in this particular case for
passing into arguments this one over

129
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,930
here that's actually cut off is dash
customer name and the reason why the

130
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,530
customer name is theirs because that
gets written into the HTML and then the

131
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:42,030
other one is simply just a path year ago
he's very necessary Paso customer name a

132
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:46,300
quick witnesses file path and you're
passing in this file so go ahead and

133
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,700
kick that off with gonna do is going two
parts to that file and then gonna start

134
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,360
speeding out HTML reports for each one
of the hosts we have tested this up to

135
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,240
about a four hundred megabytes file I
have to admit power says XML processing

136
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,380
can be unpredictable there are few ways
to do it but in this particular case we

137
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,260
did our best to make it is optimized we
could however it's going to parse

138
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,090
through each one of those each one of
the hosts and it's going to create

139
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:26,390
various Post reports and in the output
directory you will get you put it like

140
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:31,380
down what you gotta love as director you
see their acne Corp that's actually

141
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:39,100
where the focus that will be created for
navigating

142
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:53,930
became his key stuck you know everybody
everybody watch her and click

143
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,840
backup directory

144
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,150
go down there you go

145
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,730
Yeah Yeah Yeah right there when the ACMA
court directory and it's going to create

146
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,040
index HTML you open that up in a modern
browser please by modern I mean I eleven

147
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,900
plus I've used if you're an enterprise
and you're running like i fix your

148
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,850
problems but anyways open that up in a
in a modern browser what you'll get is

149
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:30,900
actually this report that is gonna hit
the screen right about now

150
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,060
ok so when you gonna see is I won't
worry about doing too much to the

151
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,720
chagrin caissons but basically a summary
page scroll down a little bit police

152
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,540
this is all PowerShell base hold up
right there

153
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,840
over on the left you get a chart that
describes the percentage of

154
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,190
vulnerabilities that are contained in
the report this is all completely

155
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,830
PowerShell beso it sitting on top of the
dynamic framework for making calls the

156
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,340
dinette visualization libraries so
requirement is partial three-plus in

157
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,380
this particular case so scroll down what
you gonna get it you're gonna get

158
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,970
something of a heat map I guess for lack
of a better term and you open that up

159
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,640
and what you're gonna see is in the
upper left the these are color-coded

160
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,800
match what you get an Asus and in the
upper left you see host where it's it's

161
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:27,050
it's all based on criticality serve you
click on one of those shows how is not

162
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:33,430
working in her sport restricted space
remaining straps allow blocked content

163
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:42,089
please its gonna run at 09 jQuery

164
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:55,009
with that so anyways what will
eventually happen while this group is

165
00:13:55,009 --> 00:14:02,430
running is the vulnerabilities will
compress air compressor ok and when you

166
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:09,149
can actually do is that is just so weird
to do you like right-click anywhere you

167
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,439
you can go into one of these an expanded
and actually get details on the

168
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:17,550
vulnerability itself go back up if you
don't mind these these reports are all

169
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:24,069
ip-based but in the upper right-hand
corner there is there is a report or its

170
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:28,129
just as vulnerable report so one feature
that we know who's going to win as you

171
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:31,290
can see by AP but then you're gonna want
a massive list of all the

172
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,850
vulnerabilities that are organized and
if you click in one of those vulnerable

173
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,649
you're gonna see each and every one of
the ideas that are affected so this is

174
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,879
what it was that if you were to hire us
and we did a princess who are you an

175
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:47,670
Asus we would give you the output of
this however like I said we use pen test

176
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:52,079
tools that everybody has devoted their
time to enter leeson open source so

177
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,129
we're putting this out and get home with
full instructions on how you can

178
00:14:55,129 --> 00:15:00,240
customize it for your company logo
everywhere so you want to use internally

179
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,389
this would be great if you do not want
your orders access to Nexus which we

180
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:20,410
understand course so that's that's why
its windows click click the top on yeah

181
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,110
yeah so scroll down and this new cases
only one IP that's associated to that

182
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,040
their egos are now actually broken down
by AP by a port protocol description

183
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,019
that kind of stuff any questions about
what you seen so far no you like in this

184
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:41,199
is this worthwhile ok ok I see had nice
so what we're gonna do is for the final

185
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:48,319
demo Hans here wrote a natural that will
actually allow you to on the fly

186
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:50,830
create multiple servers

187
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,860
at are in Amazon AWS and then proxy all
of your iPod connection to it so we're

188
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,390
switching from blue team back to red
team so there could be some some good

189
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,090
use for blue chip as well if you don't
want to get caught for whatever reason

190
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:07,550
but red team that this is this is an
outstanding to also actually going to

191
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:16,240
talk and tight and click so alright so
when the problems that we ran into a

192
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,300
doing these assessments that the clinton
we work with either it was a blind

193
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,850
assessment or they just forgot to
whitelist us so we're running our scans

194
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,630
and mapper Burke whatever eventually
their ideas IPS or file to start

195
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,120
blocking us that we have to switch to
new IP publicly or we have to go online

196
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,830
to start writing a chapter that without
actually lame what if we could use this

197
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,800
kind of a botnet where we could generate
traffic locally and then shipped across

198
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,790
the Internet across multiple machines
kind did you know that all too

199
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,120
differently to different systems and
have it come from those you distribute

200
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,700
the load making it difficult for tea and
device to really protect you in and

201
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,190
block you and so that's what this tool
is the tool itself does have a few

202
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,680
switches that you sent to it in this
case is designed to interact with Amazon

203
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,570
so you'd have to provide an image I D
and image type 80 would be to build in

204
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,949
this case were using their boon to build
the image type in this case is that

205
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,020
teaching micro because we don't need a
lot of horsepower on these images a

206
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,300
number of instances you want to spend up
to 32 up to 20 with the regulations with

207
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,810
Amazon you can go higher but I think it
to ask permission for region that's

208
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,240
going through and then the key idea
Nexus key those are the keys that you

209
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,090
get with Amazon when you sign up an
account this is this is all written in

210
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:40,120
Python using the photo yeah exactly yeah
yeah so he's this library with Kelly but

211
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,970
there's to comment on this trip we can
download it just a pip install so in

212
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:51,380
this example here I'll just start off by
going to do it so we show that we're

213
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:58,179
going to be great now we just have one
interface and econ

214
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:13,610
network oh no they video demo it's
really tomorrow is bigger

215
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:19,379
alright so alright so what's going on
here is I'm doing it as look up to to

216
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:26,830
show that the IP really apologize
terribly small do you know how no no

217
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,100
alright well what was going on

218
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,200
0 we just have simply packets

219
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,370
03

220
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,930
hello folks he care of my question why
haven't the video big here

221
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:48,610
flights continued and nobody would be a
crash but some women are you coming back

222
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:56,670
about the twenty-one minute 45 seconds
so do some investigation by Startech

223
00:18:56,670 --> 00:21:39,870
capture devices to replace some heavy
media ones but needs

224
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:47,020
earlier work

225
00:21:47,020 --> 00:22:08,920
river

226
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:17,600
there were no

227
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:39,960
are ready

228
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,390
three were murdered
