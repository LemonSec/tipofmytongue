1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,970
agents and I'll be talking about
bypassing two factor authentication with

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:09,940
Android remote access churches little
bit about myself I'm a researcher at

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,610
Fish me and one of my passions dealing
with our research is taking a look at

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:21,170
those command-and-control infrastructure
for malware especially ones that are

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,609
utilized PHP panels like finding
vulnerabilities in those arms my hobbies

6
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,039
include drumming in music

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,290
feel free to hit me up on Twitter or my
work email to go over our agenda for

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,860
today so we'll talk about why miscreants
are utilizing mobile rats after account

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,960
takeover introduced three families
talked about how they're spreading in

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,100
the Wild Arms in previous campaign info
the different command control

11
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,789
infrastructure types also talk about
some medications that organization's

12
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,649
commitment to combat these threats and
finally of course what I like to talk

13
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,510
about is the vulnerabilities our
families first little disclaimer though

14
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,970
since we are talking about exploitation
of concepts definitely going to try at

15
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:19,460
home unless you wanna by men in dark
suits and you know there might be some

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,159
hostile URLs my presentation so
definitely don't want to visit those on

17
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:31,320
your mobile device so I miscreants are
using mobile remote access Trojans well

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,229
as financial institution start to
implement two-factor no longer is

19
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:43,970
account takeover solely relying on user
names and passwords so they now need a

20
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:50,100
one-time SMS pin so by infecting the
device can also do conducting a phishing

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,579
campaign the mystery now has every piece
of that pie for account takeover one

22
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,329
other issue that I've seen is that you
know some of these fi they don't have

23
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:02,920
any official Android application in the
market

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,490
so you already have a user base that's
used to you know going to third-party

25
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,590
application stores looking for
unofficial applications for their

26
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,880
financial data is also a low entry point
compared to you know modern PC men in

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,510
the browser Mauer and the reason why
they're so successful that there's a

28
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,400
lack of Mobile Antivirus adoption and
Kaspersky put out her recent report

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,739
believe that actually was like early
2015 saying that one in five Android

30
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:39,350
users encounter encountered a mobile
threat at least once in 2014 really

31
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:48,069
interesting thread really seen that
Android malware ecosystem take you

32
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,489
through the steps of normal to factor
accounts take over there are even miss

33
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:58,130
create here starts with a mouse pam
campaign you know fish are victim clicks

34
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,130
on that looks like you know the FI login
that he's you soon to voters his

35
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,880
username and password and of course the
setbacks them as gramm steps to see

36
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,660
factor account takeover so that phishing
site has some sort of verbiage saying

37
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,760
will you need to download our latest
mobile application in order to be more

38
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,060
secure so that victims you know
downloads and installs it on his mobile

39
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,769
then as a financial institution sends
SMS one-time pen and a mobile device

40
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,790
says there's compromise that the
miscreant and gets a copy of that he has

41
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:45,120
every piece of the pie for counter so
one way that miscreants are duping users

42
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,500
into installing these moderates is a
process called binding its most of these

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,769
are baked into the crime where families
that all talk about here in a minute

44
00:03:54,769 --> 00:04:00,519
socially you can use a binder to wrap a
legitimate application with you know any

45
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,100
type of Android malware so definitely
seen that in the wall street side of

46
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,200
another binder here

47
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:16,660
they're essentially two types of command
control infrastructure for mobile Mauer

48
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,400
pretty much the same that you see on the
PC side for rats I like to categorize

49
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:28,880
season 22 different avenues one being
jabbed Java c2 and the other being PHP

50
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,930
panels for the first family will talk
about it

51
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:38,110
Andrew rad Java cease to also known as
sander rather droid jack and the second

52
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:46,620
family as I banking which speech P panel
and then finally done early so the job

53
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,139
is he to you know most of these are
going to be run off of residential

54
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:55,030
high-speed connections so a lot of the
the seats you domains that you see will

55
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:01,320
use utilize some sort of dynamic dns
account such as nineteen hours no ip

56
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,590
dougans so on these are generally run on
PC which begs the question you know most

57
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,120
of these crime where kids they've been
released free online some sort of leak

58
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,460
and you know sometimes by doing that the
person it's releasing her three might in

59
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,500
bed some sort of back doors kid which
are you know completes our SEC issues

60
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:34,520
for a mystery and these are also highly
flood susceptible PHP commanding control

61
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:40,570
also known as panels in the underground
a color and one of the huge issues with

62
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,660
this is that there's a lack of input
validation in the PHP code itself which

63
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,430
leads you know rise to PHP shall upload
vulnerabilities remote code execution

64
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,560
sequence action are permanent permanent
cross-site scripting so on so forth

65
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,350
these are also very susceptible to layer
7 flood attacks cheerleaders are hosted

66
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:08,520
on compromised websites or toss away VPS
accounts for the first family get into

67
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,419
an example of a job seats you family
first known as injury and changed its

68
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:21,530
name to save your ad now it's available
as droid Jack in August of 2014 there

69
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:27,930
was a active campaign as you can see
pictured right here pretending to be

70
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:33,169
from Kaspersky saying that she needed to
install this mobile security application

71
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:39,050
so this was spam doubt as an attachment
to Melissa's apk targeted polish

72
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:46,190
financial institutions and also Germany
via SMS or someshit attacks on so as

73
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,020
minded as Kaspersky anti-virus and and
for the German AFI's it was actually

74
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,490
targeted as a Google service framework
update and there has been attribution

75
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,590
for the authors leading back to India
you can still buy now on hacker forums

76
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:07,850
dotnet or the official site which is a
Droid Droid Jack dotnet some of its

77
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:13,570
features has full fine File Manager
remote file manager capability SMS

78
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,220
interception of course for its affected
by passing contacts grabbing GPS

79
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,590
tracking record calls and audio tapes to
imagine that remote ambient bug device

80
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:33,389
for someone's cell phone in the same
thing with video spy cam screenshot here

81
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,510
the actual crime where kid again

82
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:40,479
Jabu Jabu based seats to not only would
this be able to generate they became

83
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,520
itself but also access the server in
which infected device check back in

84
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:54,960
after the last time package price of
$210

85
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,150
whenever I take a look at this

86
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,440
been following his family's for a while
so I was like to see you know how many

87
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,930
fresh samples are hitting virustotal so
utilizing virustotal intelligence last

88
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,370
Monday so several fresh samples still
hitting virustotal so still seen in

89
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:21,440
awhile so as I mentioned earlier you
know these are extremely susceptible so

90
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,710
in a lab situation set up there one of
these servers and just with a simple

91
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:31,240
soon flood within a matter of a couple
six seconds was able to really just

92
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:42,270
crushed this CPU so yeah maybe just
completely unresponsive for the second

93
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,050
family that will get into his car died
thinking this is a PHP pain already has

94
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:52,690
targeted financial institutions in 2013
and is still used today this was

95
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,980
famously used by the never cracked part
I'm sorry never quest also known as of

96
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,290
track crime aircrew bought track being a
man in the browser crimeware for PC

97
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:11,390
initially sold this was between for game
5 k use dollars so pretty high entry

98
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:17,839
point more oriented towards the crime
aircrews that she see realizing that

99
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:25,230
type of software so the source code for
this particular family was leaked in

100
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,820
2014 intercourse with any type of crime
where kid that's leaked that of course

101
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:36,350
no spawns variants of that as a good
example say you know Zeus browser

102
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,750
exploit are now browser exploit but the
actual crime family at cease same issue

103
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,270
on several variants that

104
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:50,640
some of its features include capturing
SMS of course and Collis premium rates

105
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,000
cans incoming call redirect so in the
event that you know I'm conducting a

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,800
campaign without thinking and do a
couple of fraudulent transactions if I

107
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,740
had the bank calling that individual to
verify that I can just call me to verify

108
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,190
the transaction

109
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,030
seen that a couple times and campaigns
are record calls and Mike again so one

110
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,060
unique feature getting two more like the
crime we're into things as they dance I

111
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,310
forensic capability so this family has
the ability to wipe all device data to

112
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,950
prevent you know forensics later on

113
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:32,470
pictured right here is actually inject
from abroad track configuration that

114
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:39,580
prompted the user to install a facebook
one-time password OTP this was actually

115
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:46,330
a high banking inject was involved track
about three months ago systems utilize

116
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:59,120
so very prevalent in looking at the
fresh samples that had virustotal

117
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,590
intelligence that's monday so with that
source code lead enemies in February of

118
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:12,320
2014 researcher pull down the panel
named xylitol and founding in

119
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,850
unrestricted file upload vulnerability

120
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:20,449
picture down at the bottom here is the
national admin screenshot so let's do we

121
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:25,389
offer this one you could see that this
wasn't really marketed towards your your

122
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:32,269
average rad dude user this was more set
up solely with primary intent not only

123
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:39,329
with the features but with no the back
and coach with the crazy thing about it

124
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:43,540
even though that this has been publicly
disclosed people still uses our family

125
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:51,980
with the vulnerable panel going over the
proof of concept here so the sin filed a

126
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,259
PHP file included in the crime market in
the panel source code itself what does

127
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:04,970
was intended for was in the Indian you
know audio samples were being uploaded

128
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,120
to the them our seats you from a
compromise device was being accepted

129
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,579
from the sin falta PHP in a drops into
the sound directory so there's virtually

130
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:18,440
no upload restrictions at all so you can
upload PHP back to our show as i've done

131
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:25,279
here in this example in a lab and then
you know accessing the show within the

132
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:34,939
sound directory / shelter PHP the last
family with tocqueville's another PHP

133
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:41,519
panel family this is called Android
March of 2014 cert India published

134
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,360
several warnings targeting the financial
institutions and the government sector

135
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,389
over there originally sold for $300 on
forms and US still being sought today

136
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:58,560
you may have heard about this recently
in the news in that the dark OD heck

137
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,920
informed bust the particular author was
busted within this roundup and turns out

138
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,480
he wasn't internal fire i working on
none other than our other was pretty

139
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,630
interesting

140
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:20,520
does the guy pictured right there so
some of the features for this is

141
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,800
probably the most feature rich were at
that i've seen

142
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,800
definitely geared towards more of you
know your your new this actor record

143
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,400
calls and Mike intercept text messages
course access call logs call phone

00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,220
numbers

145
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,440
open web pages you can probably think of
some sort of you know social engineering

146
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,720
campaign that you might be able to get
that remote support scans perhaps comes

147
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,230
my ex felon upload files one unique
feature is actually has a built in

148
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,110
denial of service so you know any

149
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:59,990
are compromised mobile device you can
have that senate services to people when

150
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,940
other unique features the crowd
harvesters so I believe those like

151
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,990
whatsapp and Skype some of those other
well-known I am tools being able to

152
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:16,810
scrape the credentials out in that back
to the seats are still very prevalent

153
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,310
probably the most prevalent out of all
the three families so highly utilized in

154
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,810
the world today

155
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:31,180
screen side of the seats use this was
actually a screenshot within their

156
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,830
marketing material but very feature-rich
as you can see indefinitely geared

157
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:42,190
towards more of a noobish actor reason
beings in a very flashy GUI google map

158
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,220
overlay of you know your compromise
devices so you can check in real time in

159
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,810
GPS really cool features but the amount
of time that they worked on their front

160
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:59,250
in HTML JSP completely didn't even
bother with the back in PHP code and I'm

161
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,280
still has pain was actually source leaks
so not only the panel but also the

162
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,490
National apk generation August 2014
still available on github

163
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:14,149
so merely put on that panel that weekend
discovered a remote code execution

164
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:20,520
vulnerability among others including
seek injection and cross-site so

165
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:30,190
essentially how it works the apply
settings that PHP file it writes code to

166
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:36,170
configure PHP so by sending our
specially crafted post a request to

167
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,589
apply settings that PHP that has been
written to the config php file so his

168
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:46,589
subsequent request to configure PHP you
have a remote code execution so one

169
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:51,610
other issue with that is that a
completely zeros out to config php file

170
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:58,430
and is very noisy but it also completely
renders that panel interoperable with

171
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,490
other you know can take to appease
people files like a CMS like WordPress

172
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,290
or something and no longer has
credentials to check in with the data

173
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:12,930
base in doesn't know how users so
completely denied service the panel's

174
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:21,070
well so by injecting peas beans you can
take that p2p file in the previous

175
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,529
example I just passed you get premiere
of Season 2 system function and we have

176
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:31,380
remote command execution by passing that
in I'm having that you know I go out the

177
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,560
user name that Apache is running

178
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,630
little bit about the mitigation of this
under wrap up here a little bit when you

179
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,590
leave some time for questions as an
organization that we want to monitor the

180
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,160
official and unofficial application
repositories for your brand especially

181
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,970
any type of spam or D Mark fields that
you might be able to get realize too

182
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,740
that by implementing two factors your
organization's thinking about moving

183
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,709
that area that increases your mobile
attacks one thing that I have seen that

184
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,360
some organizations are doing instead of
relying on SMS for that once I'm pen

185
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,030
they actually have their own
authenticator app that's pretty cool

186
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,000
idea I'm so not relying on SMS elisa
makes it a little bit harder and that

187
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the event in the event that devices
compromise its able to receive SMS

188
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,600
messages he sets out of band within its
own application so that's pretty cool

189
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,850
idea I think definitely time to educate
our user base more special with the

190
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,750
dangers of utilizing third-party
application stores and so what I've seen

191
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:50,840
sooo is that not so so much of a problem
here in the states mainly overseas in

192
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,360
that some devices most of them actually
they're actually ship without the

193
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,210
official Google player app store there
are used to use utilizing third-party

194
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,490
application stores so that is that
something that they're already doing

195
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:12,060
which was which is an issue if we want
to have them a report suspicious

196
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:17,429
activity and of course one cannot fail
to mention earlier is that all of these

197
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:24,810
Trojans that I recently went over is
that there it does not require any type

198
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:30,200
of rude or jailbroken permissions these
are all once the the user's duped into

199
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,720
installing this whenever that's going
through the installation process this

200
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,170
request for the installation is pretty
much every developer API requests under

201
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:43,720
the Sun so it's pretty big red flag that
you'll see whenever installing these

202
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,410
Trojans sent a request

203
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:54,180
mission so with that I believe that
written no remote access Trojans require

204
00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:01,500
a very high level of social engineering
that's pretty much it for my

205
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,260
presentation for now you have any
questions concerns

206
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:25,280
peaches grapes misplace it would be the
initial download I believe you know for

207
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,510
that apk so they would have to have that
the device configured

208
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,920
what I have seen is that you know there
are strict instructions that you have to

209
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,580
allow third-party apps gently with
within the the fishing campaign itself

210
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,720
will have you know instructions you have
to allow application has been installed

211
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,980
outside of the App Store a third-party
install so that's step one to download

212
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,910
the game and then from there during the
installation yet to approve all of the

213
00:19:53,910 --> 00:20:01,260
permissions that that rat request so
doesn't utilize any type of you know OS

214
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,650
level exploit anything's all what's
available to the developer API good

215
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,680
question of any others

216
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:29,970
yeah ok then I'm actively engaged in
looking at every panel but I would say

217
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:36,430
most of them are rarely see Windows you
know utilizing a LAMP stack lamps I

218
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,260
guess

219
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,620
yeah most of the web least from what
I've seen PHP runs on what like 80% of

220
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:49,920
websites like that so I believe most of
them would be utilizing some type of web

221
00:20:49,920 --> 00:21:15,410
stack had another hand simply one way to
mitigate the threat of think so yeah

222
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,140
what what I have seen was some financial
institutions lol don't have their own

223
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,470
banking application that a subset
one-time authenticator is that where

224
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:38,250
you're going with that ur ok so yes some
other type of out-of-band authentication

225
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,960
other than are utilizing some other type
of messaging medium other than SMS via

226
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,740
at some I think that's the way to go

227
00:21:46,740 --> 00:22:01,080
question back not currently I know
there's recently some stuff that came

228
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:09,360
out so apparently overseas in china is
really hard to download Xcode IDE for

229
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,980
iOS and apparently some people at church
and eyes that and there has been some

230
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,390
rumors are some research that came out
this said that had some ties to

231
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:26,030
financial you know account takeover for
those but I haven't had a chance to play

232
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,350
with

233
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:38,840
for Windows no I'm sorry a Windows
Phones pretty securing loans targeting

234
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:50,549
then maybe you can still get 0067 any
other questions
