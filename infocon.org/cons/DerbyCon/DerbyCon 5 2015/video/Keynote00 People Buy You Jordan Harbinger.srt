1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
I don't know Jordan III got to know
Jordan throughout stress in a year I we

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,750
do the social engineer podcast together
and I Jordan came on and i know i member

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,410
when chris is like a you know I would
have enjoyed an on-site do this podcast

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:19,180
he was a huge hit the way he talked and
in what he did as a living and George is

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,600
an interesting one because you didn't
you know he's not a security guy but he

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,800
has become part of us as he does because
he deals with human behavior on a

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,330
regular basis and how to interact with
people and for us that one the biggest

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,270
challenges that we have is that human
interaction peace the social engineering

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,390
piece that we do and Jordan one of the
best I've ever seen him so he became a

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,260
member on the associate your podcast I
think the number fourteen criss cross

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:54,480
the ocean your pocket 14 2010 14:44 home
in and so Jordan came in came in and

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,710
really brought a lot of life to the i
pod cast and we became good friends in

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,329
the first time I met Jordan was at black
cat and I are just think it was that we

14
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:06,619
had breakfast with paying in a few
others that were sitting there and I got

15
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:10,680
to meet Jordan and I just a phenomenal
person and I just wanted me to be here

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,810
at the keynote at least we have to say
because I really respect or deny what he

17
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,100
does and I mean that he does for the
community and I mean no come in from the

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,460
outside in

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,979
he's been a valuable asset to the
InfoSec industry I'm so I'd like to

20
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,680
welcome Jordan here and I cannot impose
governor applause and a warm day began

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,690
welcome

22
00:01:32,690 --> 00:02:02,830
first things first as fast as possible
that the move

23
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:15,470
wow that remind me remind me to thank
you for that later

24
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,410
holy cow you know who is here for minor
become presentation a couple years ago

25
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:26,470
about social engineering it was loaded
with visuals really well rehearsed this

26
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:36,120
presentation is nothing like that
presentation as far as I know now one of

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,880
the things I notice right when I got
here was that this is about community

28
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,709
the theme is unity and I like that
because at first I thought I'm not

29
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,220
technical I don't know anything in the
text field well enough I can barely even

30
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,900
fix my own email client on my friggin
iPhone I got a guy for that right but

31
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,120
what I can tell you is about
relationship development and connections

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,830
and I thought alright I've gotta talk
that I can run based on this because one

33
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,519
of the things that we deal with that the
art of charm is connection and we get a

34
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,850
lot of emails from people in this field
the text field the InfoSec field seems

35
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,280
to be a field where a lot of folks find
it really comfortable in a cubicle alone

36
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,110
by themselves working on a computer to
the wee hours but not a lot of people

37
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,400
feel comfortable interacting with other
humans which I find really ironic

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,670
especially in the security field which
is based around largely human behavior

39
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,489
and human mistakes which we focus on a
lot on the social engineer podcast now

40
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,770
for me a lot of folks think well this
comes naturally to you

41
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,580
so why should I even listen to you
you're different type of person that me

42
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,370
and when I was a kid I was so painfully
shy I could barely deal with it if you

43
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,150
told me just a few years ago that I'd be
standing on a stage in front of what we

44
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,850
had 2,200 people minus those that slept
in I would never have believed you a

45
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:06,310
stage like this from people all over the
world I never would have believed you

46
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:14,260
now when I was really young I found
myself with a brand new computer that

47
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,870
had the Internet is black and white
called gopher some of you probably

48
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,780
remember that at least that's what I
thought the internet was right in the

49
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,500
dawn of america online as my internet
provider which my parents had until last

50
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,350
year and I realized by the way most of
you are just killing time before age

51
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,990
team or so if you want to whip out candy
crush I'm not gonna be offended and at

52
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,510
first but I'm gonna tell you might seem
totally irrelevant to you and even to

53
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,610
your industry but today I want you to
challenge these assumptions because if

54
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,450
you willfully ignored this skill set
your willfully ignoring honestly

55
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,550
willfully ignorant of the secret game
being played around you know like I said

56
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,650
painful shyness is a kid something
probably a lot of us can relate to even

57
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,360
now for some of us and I used to skip
school and run home and play on the

58
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,980
internet or a gopher or whatever that
was

59
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,840
rent and it wasn't the cool kind of
skipping school when you're on parade

60
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,420
fluids singing and going to fancy
restaurants like Ferris Bueller this is

61
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,710
the kind of skipping school where your
parents come home at 5 p.m. and they

62
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:28,669
find you sharing DCC files on IRC in
your underwear now before I forget

63
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,140
there's a slide with this challenge on
it that's the only visual I have to be

64
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,990
up the whole time this is a challenge to
get people out of their shell that's you

65
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,070
guys and myself for that matter I've got
thirty days of drills and exercises

66
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,390
their progressively harder but they
start off really easy they get you

67
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,090
meeting other folks connecting them to
each other and developing more solid

68
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,050
relationships as a result I highly
encourage you to do this

69
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:58,800
I don't think we're going to spam you if
we do you can blame this guy right here

70
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,740
with the DSLR in the front row it's
Jason he's he's the guy got to blame on

71
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,129
for pretty much everything now this
school thing wasn't working for me the

72
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:16,169
system was not working for me at all I
knew that I was just two days of school

73
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,490
away from failing out of freakin middle
school fails middle school because

74
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,720
they're on the internet nobody even knew
what that was I got in trouble with the

75
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,710
FBI back then that's another story that
I probably told my Christmas podcast I

76
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,250
got in trouble with the police a bunch
not for anything cool I ordered pizza

77
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,270
for my whole school on a credit card but
I made up which is why they couldn't

78
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,039
find the owner and that confounded the
police to know and they literally had to

79
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,550
call the FBI so after a really
successful middle school career I

80
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,199
started to figure some stuff out
socially but not really ready got a

81
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,000
haircut and took showers that was like
my major first step towards being cool

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,550
popular and it had limited success and
when I went to college my friends were

83
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,199
successful people to they were all smart
they were like everybody here in this

84
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,610
room really intelligent going places
some went to Wall Street someone to work

85
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,810
for america online which was still a
thing in 1997 but I needed some time to

86
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,479
figure this stuff out I had no idea what
the hell I was going to do so one day I

87
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:25,080
got up bright and early about 2 p.m. for
a college kid and went to BestBuy and I

88
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,099
needed a new Walkman and I was talked
with the guy that work there and he said

89
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:31,779
look man why don't you just works here
for a while to figure out what you want

90
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:36,090
to do you know a lot about that stuff
and it's a great phone repair computers

91
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:42,319
help people fix their their modems the
new 28 cases are coming out indefinitely

92
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,120
hustle some of those is a trust your
role here buddy you need to sell some

93
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,710
CDs for a few years before you can move
up to your customer service and computer

94
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:59,009
repair so I saw my bright future go down
the tubes and travel life-size cutout of

95
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:01,540
Britney Spears

96
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,530
so that system was clearly still not
working for me at all

97
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:11,120
back against the wall with no employment
options whatsoever couldn't even get a

98
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,930
job at Best Buy with a college degree
from the University of Michigan I did

99
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:24,210
what a lot of guys do when they have no
future opportunity and I became a lawyer

100
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,650
somebody's like that it's too close to
home and i got a job on Wall Street

101
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,360
which is awesome so my friends were
already there I actually got the job

102
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,070
through connection through my old
roommates old roommate what are the odds

103
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,520
and when I got hired there is a guy who
hired me coincidentally also named Dave

104
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,300
he was a special breed he was cool I've
never met anybody who was cool and an

105
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,820
adult is kind of awesome and when he was
hiring me he was throwing the football

106
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,150
around in his office and tell me how
great it was to work at the firm and how

107
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,870
we're gonna do all this amazing stuff in
this interesting work that I didn't

108
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,900
understand at all the time and I took
the job and then I went there that first

109
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,740
summer and he was my mentor or read like
wolf of Wall Street Oyster shooters on

110
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,960
the roof with Matthew McConaughey only I
never saw him ever it never did any

111
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:22,240
oyster shooters ever anywhere on any
proof anywhere in New York and H are of

112
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,780
course was the one who has signed him to
be mine meant to our and he hated that

113
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,050
idea that was just repugnant Lee
poisonous to have like i got to hang

114
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,190
around with this guy and so they asked
me one day in the middle of summer how's

115
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,940
your mentorship program going and I said
oh it sucks I haven't seen my mentored

116
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,690
eight years in like two months and
everybody else is drinking eating gonna

117
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,520
see blue man group I want to see blue
man group Davis and even showed to the

118
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,970
office so they make Dave take me out for
coffee that's by the way a terrible way

119
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:59,450
to get ahead at work till age are that
your boss sucks not recommended show

120
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,860
dave's banging away on his Blackberry
and we're sitting at Starbucks and was

121
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,000
like alright dude ask me anything you
want

122
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,260
he's probably thinking

123
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:13,870
I'm gonna go alright so derivative deals
ABC wxyz and he's gonna write rate fell

124
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,290
off some crappy textbook answer is going
to be over it then he's gonna be off the

125
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:17,810
hook

126
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:23,760
check the box on the AHR form handled
and I said Polly not caring about my job

127
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,710
at this point at all how come everybody
says you're the man you make all this

128
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,800
money you're one of the most powerful
partners here but you're never in the

129
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,810
office and he pauses like he just lost
his ball and brick breaker those of you

130
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,480
who have blackberries know what I'm
talking about right and he said his

131
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,850
Blackberry don't hardly any liens
forties like do people really say that

132
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,690
of course at this point I'm like
backtracking is fast like a dog baby I

133
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:57,620
don't have you heard that somewhere and
get this is how I get fired at Starbucks

134
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,710
in front of like 300 people in Manhattan
just have to call my parents like hey

135
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,050
can I can I come home for ever

136
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,010
is the basement still free and he leans
forward and tells me well I'll tell you

137
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,690
what I'll tell you why I'm never in the
office because his lawyers right which

138
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,320
was to bill

139
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,250
hours so it's a mystery that nobody's in
the office twenty-four seven before I

140
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,210
tell you what he said let me tell you
this about a week prior to that I

141
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,610
thought I'd be a big baller and bring a
girl into my office on Saturday night

142
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,840
because you can get into World Financial
Center $0.24 so I show up with her she's

143
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,980
a get rid of me I figure it's like one
o'clock in the morning Saturday night's

144
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,300
gonna look so badass review Manhattan
from my office my office mates not

145
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,240
barrel distillery the whole office is
mine I got a bottle of something in my

146
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,580
drawer this is gonna be sweet so I role
in the elevator doors open and I see

147
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,850
everyone that I work with in all the
lights are on

148
00:11:53,850 --> 00:12:01,200
1 o'clock in the morning Saturday so I
do what you always do I get the hell out

149
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,900
of there before anybody knew I showed up
to give me any work and I ran home I'd

150
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,640
like to say that there was some happy
ending to that story but there's not I

151
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,769
just literally just brand how she's
probably still in the office

152
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:18,429
and I noticed that everyone was there
and it just made no sense to me and I

153
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:23,369
thought what the hell I left at like
four sho on Tuesday when it was safe and

154
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,420
clear I asked one of the senior
associates what's the deal how come

155
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,569
everybody was there so late as well what
night was a Saturday were always there

156
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:36,420
on Saturday at one o'clock in the
morning so here's everyone that I work

157
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,410
with sons Dave working in the office
till one o'clock in the morning on a

158
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,509
Saturday night apparently something
regular Dave however 1 p.m. on Tuesday

159
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:50,759
not in the office so he leans forward
and says I'll tell you I'm never there

160
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,259
Jordan because I bring in all the deals
are bringing all the business for this

161
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:01,379
firm me sitting in his office building
hours it's a waste of time

162
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:07,220
sure we fill out a thousand dollars an
hour to Wall Street firm but my time is

163
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,369
worth more than that and this blew my
freaking not quite teenage my friend

164
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:17,879
Mike 2224 maybe and I just can't believe
that someone's time would ever be worth

165
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,999
that amount of money and he says look if
I bring in a million dollar loan deal

166
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:29,040
and it takes maybe several dozen hours
do the math and I did and it changed the

167
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:37,399
way that I look at work for ever because
to me this makes no sense your billing

168
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,790
hours this is how we make in David James
from Brooklyn any edit and so I believed

169
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:49,449
that man has he knew something we did
not know now most of the guys I'm new at

170
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:54,860
work or sleeping under the desk they
were trying to outwork each other they

171
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,720
were undercutting each other there were
people there from other countries who

172
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,149
left their families in frickin India and
Pakistan and Mexico and other

173
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:09,079
Canada other exotic places and they had
nothing to do but work and that wasn't

174
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:13,689
me I was trying to get by unnoticed and
enjoy New York a little bit and I

175
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:17,449
certainly wasn't the smartest one there
now a lot of you can't maybe identify

176
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:21,230
with a kiss rooms loaded with geniuses I
think I've although I've met some of you

177
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,720
last night so they're definitely
exceptions to that

178
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,769
but I knew that I couldn't outwork
everybody I knew that was gonna happen

179
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:33,509
and I knew that I wasn't the most
talented guy in the room so I knew that

180
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:37,589
I was gonna get fired at some point it
was only a matter of time so they found

181
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:41,399
out I was the exception I should have
been hired and I should not be there

182
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,779
anymore and I know by the way that's
called imposter syndrome I know a lot of

183
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,860
you probably still feel that way about
your job right now see a lot of

184
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,500
head-shaking in the audience and now
they're looking around like I hope

185
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:59,579
nobody saw me shake my head and so
that's when I realized look tables in

186
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:04,220
the smooth this he wasn't the hardest
working guy he was just the most

187
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,110
well-connected lawyer in the whole firm
he was compensated as such as

188
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,589
relationships with other people were
what brought value to the business he

189
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:21,399
had the rarest still set in the firm and
that's when I realized this really sunk

190
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:31,500
in in order to succeed inside the system
I had to work outside the system and for

191
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,140
many of us

192
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,700
that means is that the strength of our
relationships directly leads to

193
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:42,390
flexibility and prosperity and
opportunity for that matter how many of

194
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,310
you found your job because you upload a
resume to monster.com or something like

195
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,600
that and how many of you found what
you're doing right now because of a

196
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,650
connection or relationship that you had
a chance many more hence the rest of

197
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,670
your plane candy crush cool I totally
get it and there's a chance that a

198
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,980
handful of you out there actually like
not working relationship development

199
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,920
networking is a dirty word and the rest
of you pretty much hate it feel smart me

200
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,570
you don't even bring business cards
because you just feel like a dbag

201
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,040
handing them out you know no ones gonna
call you just feel like it's just

202
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,570
instant rejection is planning some

203
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:29,750
and just like that I feel terrible
handing them out

204
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:35,850
instant rejection so today I'm gonna
tell you how to hostile opportunities to

205
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,750
kick your competitors but you have
competitors by leveraging relationships

206
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,940
they can only dream about and how to
turn something most of us dread into one

207
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,910
of your strongest competitive advantages
and that's also what this challenge is

208
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,310
designed to do by the way is designed to
get you out of your shell outside your

209
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,180
comfort zone

210
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,240
creating relationships in an unsmarmy
and very authentic way that doesn't

211
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,150
leave you needing a shower after the
interaction and we've all heard it's not

212
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,620
what you know but who you know and
usually when we hear that we say it was

213
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:14,040
some sort of stank on it right little
bit disdain about who you know anybody

214
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,079
has lost a promotion to somebody else
who's better connected he hates that I

215
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,449
hate that reality that it's about who
you know but I'm gonna tell you right

216
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,770
now this is a strength because again

217
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:31,050
secret game being played around you you
want to win that you want to be in that

218
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:36,560
if you ignore it loose and those of us
that run companies I know there's tons

219
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,320
of entrepreneurs out there even though
you never use that word because that's

220
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:46,730
also kinda you know sales even those of
you who run businesses know that the

221
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,310
most brilliant idea fail if you don't
have the right people around you to help

222
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,730
it take a look at this conference and
negative Dave try to do it himself I

223
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:59,890
mean that's you can laugh at that idea
that's ridiculous he was what makes it

224
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,020
happen everybody knows that

225
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,690
self-evident but somehow when it's our
business we don't even think about it we

226
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:11,070
don't think about people outside our
business helping us succeed and when I

227
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,070
first started networking relationship
development I thought you had to be part

228
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,380
of a secret club you were born into it
you married into it your parents had

229
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,750
some awesome connection some amazing
connections you went to a private school

230
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,820
at the little like a bad thing sewn onto
a blue blazer by the way if you can

231
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,490
marry to it highly recommended but if
you

232
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,740
are not born into it your parents are
you are born into it rather your parents

233
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,030
had to do the same thing that i'm gonna
teach you today and if your parents

234
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,460
didn't do that you gotta teach it to
your kids are there gonna be starting

235
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,150
from ground zero nobody wants a few
decades with intentional application of

236
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,760
these skills and is the good news with
intentional application of these skills

237
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,620
and these skills and the challenge you
will get better at this than somebody

238
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,170
who had it all handed to them on a plane
I don't think I need to reach too far to

239
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,360
find somebody who was born with every
opportunity and still screwed it all up

240
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,950
everybody has that guy everybody has
that guy or girl in the childhood that

241
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,590
did that you can create a better network
and those of us that were born into it

242
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,020
what people don't realize is that
relationship development and networking

243
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:22,760
is a way if it's a set of habits it's
not something you turn off it's not

244
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,520
something you even have to turn on for
that matters not handing out cards

245
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,100
hustling it's not an authentic reactions
getting people to do things for you that

246
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,090
you want that don't help that even
though I just to San Jose about a month

247
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,890
ago I know more people there than a lot
of the folks that have lived there for

248
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,610
years and the reason is because this
never turns off it once you see the

249
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:51,070
matrix analogy I know you all understand
which is great you never have to you

250
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,010
never have to look outside it there's no
going back to skills work for you

251
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:02,710
and everyone has this capacity here's an
introvert yet like the rest of you are

252
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,310
just not raising your hand cause you're
such a tough I'm not doing anything

253
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:12,400
right now he might pick someone to my
worst nightmare not do it I'm also an

254
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,530
introvert I know no one believes that
but it's true you no longer have a

255
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,000
medical excuse for why you can't be a
little bit more social than you are now

256
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,830
being an introvert just means you need
alone time doesn't mean you're allergic

257
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:28,320
to other humans sorry but this is what's
designed to get you out of your network

258
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,590
your relationships

259
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,920
this is your job search army this is
your business development army if you

260
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,410
run your own business and it keeps
opportunity flowing into your life and

261
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,250
an unstoppable clip those of you who are
married probably make your significant

262
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,460
other a relationship that previously
just it we already asked the job

263
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,960
question how you thought your current
line of work probably through

264
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,370
relationship that already existed at
least in most industries that's true and

265
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,860
Dave by the way had pure job security
and stability David guy who hired me not

266
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,760
Dave Kennedy I can't speak to his job
stability for his relationship stability

267
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,640
but Dave as our firm sank into the
recession of 2007 he walked into another

268
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,110
firm as a partner while all those people
that were there at one o'clock in the

269
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,400
morning on a Saturday night they were
punished by the recession they are now

270
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,810
all retired even when some of them are
40 and I don't think it's cuz they crush

271
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:26,890
it I think it's because they can't get
jobs he walked out of a sinking right

272
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:32,810
into a partnership he probably got a
raise because of his relationships it is

273
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:37,340
pure job security and I'll ask why many
of you are here when I give this talk to

274
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,790
entrepreneurs especially in Silicon
Valley most of us are not here because

275
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:48,290
we want lifetime corporate appointment
at a Fortune 500 list of us are not here

276
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,670
because of that in twenty years ago
nobody thought our job security would be

277
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,960
limited by recessions in manufacturing
and when I get this talking Detroit

278
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,100
bunch of dudes with beards that have

279
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,150
weight whether on their faces from
hammering steel for cars I don't have to

280
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,870
explain that point out to belabor that
one they didn't have the relationships

281
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,020
to make it clear that even in the most
down turn economy you can succeed if you

282
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,600
have the right relationships and safety
that around you

283
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,789
my company Dr have stopped the art of
charm to get that right

284
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:24,780
started in 2007 in the midst of a huge
recession because all we did was

285
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:29,020
leverage relationships and help other
people that's right we help other people

286
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,559
how does that figure into relationships
again it's not by asking for what you

287
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:37,120
want it's about figuring out how to help
others and I'll get into that here in a

288
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,559
sec

289
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:41,730
the first bit of homework but I'm going
to give you an outright come to Turkey

290
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,460
con it'll be fun they say now you have
homework don't worry it's in the

291
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,630
challenge you don't need to write it
down but if you do you get a head start

292
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,890
this sounds impossible but we're gonna
do is make a list of pretty much

293
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:58,409
everybody that you know from your moms
hairdresser is a kid to the kids played

294
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:02,210
soccer with an elementary school and
this is designed to get your reaching

295
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,020
out to them are selling them

296
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,400
computer security services are you know
social engineering penetrating

297
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,220
penetration testing or what that a
contraption thing that you built that

298
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,320
doesn't even work that well but I'm
probably gonna need in a few minutes

299
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,600
this is to get you look at your
relationships in an entirely different

300
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,090
way because whenever I talk about this

301
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:29,799
people always say why don't know anyone
I don't have any connections I don't

302
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,700
know anybody have value this is
pointless i'm not high level and certain

303
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,270
objections here but I'm this is no joke
I i mean your mom's hair dressing your

304
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,919
free content when I moved to Los Angeles
a long time ago about six years ago now

305
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,610
a toothy the first week I was there and
that even if you've ever had a to think

306
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,460
it's like the worst pain you can't think
you definitely can't work you certainly

307
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,500
can't talk into the microphone which I
do all day and so I need a dentist

308
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,039
needed fast and I kept calling everyone
in the yellow pages are on the internet

309
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,820
who uses it doesn't even still exists

310
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,890
and they all said sorry I'm full of
books I can't help you go to the ER go

311
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,250
to the ER go to the ER you know what
happens when you go to the ER with a

312
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,440
toothache they tie a string around it
and they slam the door that's what

313
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,690
happens I'm not doing that that's not
happening so I post on Facebook the last

314
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:29,170
bastion of opportunity and I said I need
a tennis in LA now who can help somebody

315
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:33,350
I don't know we all have those on
Facebook replies insult my answer

316
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,650
dentist in LA I'll give her a call he
set me up with his aunt I have crap

317
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,350
insurance at this point my life by the
way she has me do a little root canal

318
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:47,410
doesn't overcharged me and I'm I am more
thankful than you can possibly imagine I

319
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,540
can't wait to tell this guy how much I
appreciate this I sent a message he

320
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,930
brings back great I said if there's ever
anything I can do for you let me know

321
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:01,080
and of course the first thing he says is
well I'm a graphic designer of mediocre

322
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,450
talent level and I would love to work
for you and I said I don't have any

323
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,760
opportunity here thanks and now I just
feel guilty so I closed the window and

324
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,830
forget about it

325
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,180
couple of days later a friend of mine
says while I really need a graphic

326
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,650
designer every designer I know has
crapped out on me I don't even need to

327
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:22,730
be that good I just need someone who's
gonna show up to the job so I float them

328
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,770
his portfolio if he gets a job for
$80,000 a year as a full-time graphic

329
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:33,760
designer because he helped me find a
dentist on Facebook let that sink in for

330
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,950
a second if he had planned to get a job
as a graphic designer through one of my

331
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,740
connections it would not have happened
that way he only thought about how he

332
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:48,660
could help me that's it and that is as
simple as it gets and that's the secret

333
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:55,929
to networking only think about what's in
it for them

334
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,700
don't know how you can help and who
might be able to help you but it only

335
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,419
works if you're only thinking about
their needs and not just filtering for

336
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,730
your own if you're only filtering for
your own you don't jump on opportunities

337
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:13,340
like that ever is it always like this no
that's really convenient example right

338
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,730
but it's a numbers game how do you
increase your odds in a numbers game you

339
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:24,320
keep playing you increase the numbers
you need to be the guy or gal who's just

340
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,710
apparently getting lucky constantly hit
after hit and it's not about money

341
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:36,119
obviously as per my dentist's example
social capital is more powerful than

342
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:41,759
money people don't know what social
capital is to the money was invented a

343
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,159
history lesson because barter became
difficult over distance and time and

344
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,970
part my pacing I'm trying to make a
little bit of face time with everybody I

345
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,769
got this big thing in my way here soho
yes candy crush level four hundred and

346
00:26:54,769 --> 00:27:00,360
seventy-two yeah I just saw that game
yesterday just learn how to play and I'm

347
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,700
not getting it I will never produce
anything again if I get it

348
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:10,379
three hundred years ago it was hard to
move 50 goats 500 miles yet money money

349
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:15,590
is great however most of us enjoyed
money we should hang out but partner is

350
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,200
more efficient than money

351
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,009
much more because the value on each side
is greater and money is perfectly

352
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:29,139
replaceable if you're only as good as
your checkbook you are perfectly

353
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:33,730
replaceable and as people get more
successful money becomes less valuable

354
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,480
if you have more of it the value goes
down once you reach a certain level of

355
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,649
success even money is not very effective
and that starts much earlier than you

356
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:50,139
think at that point but you need to
increase your personal values or social

357
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:52,960
capital

358
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,740
even if you think they're not that high
level if i'm looking for your network

359
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,710
and not your checkbook you're much more
of a rare commodity because your network

360
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:08,700
is unique to you it's the only thing
unfortunately that's pretty unique about

361
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,950
we are not special snowflakes however
your network when you diagram it looks a

362
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:19,279
lot like a snowflake and that is about
as unique as you get you can have a bank

363
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,740
account with his Europe al's you have a
great network you can offer something to

364
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:27,230
somebody with a hundred million dollars
so would you rather be somebody who's

365
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,490
irreplaceable which would rather be
somebody who's only as good as your

366
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,409
checkbook now that we know why that's
important let's talk about who's your

367
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:41,600
network and how to level up business
fundamentally is people selling things

368
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,520
to people they know generally people
that they like people do business with

369
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,909
people they know on that and that they
like that's why country clubs exist at

370
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:50,880
all in the first place

371
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,940
there's no other reason golf only exist
because of this and everyone's heard

372
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,029
that that old adage you only go as high
as 45 closest friends I'm not saying did

373
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:03,929
your friends and built that are ones
that have more money or whatever this is

374
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:07,480
a motivational feel that session I'll
spare you but networking is one of the

375
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,799
best ways to make sure they are
constantly surrounding yourself with

376
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,940
high-value individuals high quality
people as much as you can and now I know

377
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,220
what some of your thinking this is not
some game that you play that you

378
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,289
secretly hate just because you want the
spoils

379
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:26,539
it's about helping other people and it's
important to me personally for that

380
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:32,580
reason I like people are not I know some
of you do not however humor me on this

381
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,880
one but if somebody doesn't have
integrity do not build your business do

382
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,450
not build your network around that it's
also important because unless you've

383
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,149
been very intentional about this process
for a long time

384
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:51,760
your immediate surroundings and social
circle are probably filled with a lot of

385
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,600
mediocrity people who are more than
satisfied with mediocrity

386
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,360
you surround yourself with high
achievers especially in your industry

387
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,679
you will crush these skills are
essential in any career whether you work

388
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:11,600
for a huge corporation whether you work
for yourself everything is a business

389
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:20,080
and people buy you they buy into your
vision got a photographer Nick find your

390
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,910
network and it's easier to sell yourself
to people that already know you you

391
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:32,190
can't get there by yourself and you
don't have to tell you might have to

392
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,720
move to make it happen I moved to San
Francisco I knew that's where my

393
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,740
connections were you know have to move
to Ohio

394
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,280
nobody should punish themselves like
that but you really wow there's a lot

395
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:48,820
more people here that from my house and
I thought so but that most people never

396
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:54,720
like that that little just that one in
there so I thanks Dave appreciate you

397
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,730
gotta ask yourself how can I get people
emotionally involved in my success

398
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,590
people will want to help you and they
will if you can get them emotionally

399
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:11,470
involved by helping them achieve their
goal and get them excited they want to

400
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,780
do the same for you it's about
reciprocity simple reciprocity this is

401
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,480
something that top performers rely on
all the time

402
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,409
look at charity they're loaded with
well-connected people they're loaded

403
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:29,110
with well to do people that's why people
get involved with them a lot of the time

404
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,090
fact some of us like helping people
others of us are there to meet other

405
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:38,350
people who can't the number one rule of
networking is built it before you need

406
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,090
it you have to take that well the four
years thirsty networking what you need

407
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:49,440
something whether it's a job or a
dentist is not effective how many of you

408
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,730
have ever

409
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,690
alright I'm gonna start building
relationships as soon as I launched this

410
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:58,110
product soon as I get my website up as
soon as I insert other excuse here to

411
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,690
procrastinate actually building the
relationships we need tons of people do

412
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,880
that it's one of the most common
mistakes because the framework for how

413
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,730
this works but who would you rather help
someone who's known you for years months

414
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,480
and has helped you with a few things
here and there is somebody called called

415
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,770
you out of the blue and asked you for a
favor when is the best time to network

416

when is the best time to put a spare
tire in the trunk of your car

417
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,890
networking when you need it is not
effective and it is too late

418

everyone who works at a chance he got
their job the reconnection in fact I

not find jobs you that say they'll give

422
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,680
you a number they will not give you
there's good reason for that

423
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,140
what's the currency of networking how do
we do it how do we increase our odds

424
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:04,890
generosity is the currency of network
many of you probably heard always be

425
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:10,440
closing this is always be giving this is
a constant process of giving and

426
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,950
offering help it's not a rolodex full of
business cards it's about action

427
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:20,450
something small and your enemy be huge
for someone else

dentist Facebook example and point how
many of you have ever had to ask for a

429
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:31,160
compliance and offer a job at getting a
recommendation college did that feel

430
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,160
awkward that awful the most painful
thing you have to do while India

431
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,670
professor's office and ask what your
boss's office and asked asked a friend

432
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:45,810
to hook you up with somebody that I felt
the same way if you spent weeks helping

433
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,990
that person achieve a goal on their end

434
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:54,080
absolutely not network is a pie

435
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:01,210
everybody awake now we're getting not
apply that runs out eatin used it's a

436
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:06,570
muscle that gets stronger with you the
more that you create relationships the

437
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:10,450
stronger network becomes and most people
don't understand this and this is why

438
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:16,810
they fail if you hold it on the line and
you don't just accept generosity you

439
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:21,940
asked for it it's ok if people say no
this challenge is designed to get people

440
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,810
to say yes and even more to say no

441
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:31,800
in a way that doesn't crush the ego and
soul you will get nowhere if you wait if

442
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,450
you're not as comfortable asking for
help as you are receiving and giving it

443
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:44,089
you're only working half of the equation
when I applied to law school I didn't

444
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:44,490
get it

445
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:48,990
surprise surprise then that middle
school GPA come around to bite me in the

446
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:55,919
butt and a friend of mine said why don't
you write them a letter and also got in

447
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,280
also you're good I don't have a lot of
sway but will try I wrote a letter on a

448
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,349
whim got in to give the University of
Michigan Law School in other words I got

449
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:09,400
into one of the best law schools in the
United States just because I asked I had

450
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,260
already gotten tonight from that same
school let that sink in for second most

451
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:19,260
of us here are afraid to ask I was
always afraid to ask I still have fear

452
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,619
before I asked I do it anyway because
i've seen the results firsthand

453
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:28,390
relationships cannot be overstated and
some of you probably saw my bio on the

454
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,140
program those of you who read it while
you were sober you know that I've been

455
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,410
kidnapped two times place 30

456
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,580
that's why don't travel much anymore but
when it was 25 years old I was teaching

457
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:55,190
English in serbia not siberia Serbia
Republic in the former yugoslavia

458
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,270
this one's a little louder Wow alright
everybody's awake now

459
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:08,390
Baton Relay only I'm the only guy
running in 2005 was 25 years old I was

460
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:12,050
in serbia and I have to register with
the government is a former socialist

461
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,910
countries so you have to register with
the police when you live there what that

462
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,320
means you have to tell the police where
you live

463
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,320
they don't have one of those
constitutional freedom things going on

464
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:27,470
and I wanted to live with a local
serbian person or live on my own and

465
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:32,730
you're not allowed to do that there you
have to be hosted by family and at that

466
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,620
time foreigners were really welcome at
all they were definitely not welcome to

467
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:42,320
live their long-term I had a job
teaching English on the payroll of the

468
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,800
United States Department of Defense it's
a weird sort of circular thing doesn't

469
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,240
want a story doesn't really look good on
paper to the Serbian police they kept

470
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,180
tabs on me a lot to make sure if I
wasn't a spy and like to think they did

471
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,790
that to everyone but now I'm not so sure
but I really want to live on my own

472
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,070
not living in some old ladies basement
with bolt learn how to say more than one

473
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,960
of the first words I learned in serbia
was mold because I had a lot of my

474
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,370
bedroom and i can see the plan to have
my friends I T has two in verified that

475
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:21,020
I was living with them in belgrade so
I'd register with one friend government

476
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,550
officials that spot chat get suspicious
cuz I don't have anything there and I

477
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,310
have to register with another friend
move and this went on for a while until

478
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:34,500
one day one of the detectives not to my
friends Doran said where's his room

479
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,160
where did you sleep with his backpack
was a suitcase where I belong so I get a

480
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,270
call Tuesday at one o'clock in the
morning hey man I you gotta move like

481
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:51,290
like now I said no problem I don't have
any stuff there is a no you have to go

482
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,200
to the police station and tell them that
you don't live here because they're

483
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,010
looking for you right now and normally
this is the kind of thing I would just

484
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,480
straight now but Serbia's not the kind
of place where you walk into a police

485
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,320
station ago

486
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,900
hey I heard you guys are looking for me
what can I do for you especially when

487
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:13,280
you're on the payroll of Department of
Defense shall state security now has me

488
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,820
on their radar because the police
they're completely in that they take

489
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:22,680
bribes and hand out fake traffic tickets
weeks later I'm a huge music festival on

490
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,790
a an island that had a turkish fortress
pretty badass hundred-plus thousand

491
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:31,120
people called exit anybody's into that
step and there's a black Jeep rolling

492
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,340
around like eight o'clock in the morning
at this point been up for two straight

493
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:41,820
days drinking lots of coffee course and
I see them shining lights on people and

494
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,870
you don't have to watch too many James
Bond flicks before you do realize that a

495
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:53,030
jeep with tinted windows and government
plates is a bad sign so immediately of

496
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:58,530
course soon as that hit me I'm like I'm
on it so I start walking as fast as I

497
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,740
can in the light shines on me and I'm
walking as fast as I can without running

498
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,960
and being really obvious that I'm trying
to the hell out of there and I look back

499
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,060
and there's no one else there I can't
even pretend that they were looking for

500
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,080
someone else I mean I am straight up
with one friend otherwise totally blown

501
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,480
my friend stops

502
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,800
and to make matters worse he's got a
little bit of what you might call a

503
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,890
checkered past and his father had
organized crime connections back in the

504
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:29,190
old yugoslavia not the new one so he's
basically persona non grata in the

505
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:33,300
country and I just happen to be standing
10 feet away from them so these guys

506
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,760
these state security officers which by
the way have diplomatic immunity from

507
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,690
the local law because they're usually
were criminals from bosnia to or above

508
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,840
prosecution so that they don't have to
prosecute their own fighters these are

509
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,170
bad news these guys are PTSD they
stopped us their eyes are red they're

510
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:57,670
super high on like met they brewed in
there after or something like that and I

511
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:06,240
am just I am well this is a family
audience so I am very frightened and

512
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,609
they're asking for my passport like I
don't carry my passport more like you

513
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:14,530
know it's against the law to not have
your passport and I'm like near

514
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:19,170
maybe did know that but nobody carries
their passports ridiculous and they go

515
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,830
tell me the truth leaning in like three
inches from my face

516
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:27,410
tell me the truth can you walk around
the united states and your country

517
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:34,100
without African passport tell me the
truth and I said yes I could walk around

518
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,990
the united states without a passport and
the guy turns his friend and inserting

519
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,700
in which they don't know I'm can
understand he goes well I guess they

520
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:45,210
really are truly free over

521
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:55,030
like the United States wrong the reason
they probably lived where they lived is

522
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:59,350
because dole clinton at like blown up
their hometown or something like that

523
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:04,940
helped albania Institute so I'm like I
don't need any part of this I'm 25 years

524
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,130
old I have no idea what's going on I
barely remember the nineties for

525
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,180
multiple reasons and they're talking
about how america is the enemy and they

526
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,320
bombed our country and I'm facing the
idea of getting pistol-whipped in front

527
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,960
of now an audience of like 20,000 people
so I decided to do what I do best which

528
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,350
is start talking and of course I'm like
let's make a joke right now I don't have

529
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:32,250
any bombs understand English teacher
they did not think that was cute so I

530
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,180
realize this is now becoming kind of a
serious situation this is not a day off

531
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:42,540
the keys to get them to see me as a real
person not just like ambiguous American

532
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:47,530
first one they've ever met their whole
life right so they're driving his black

533
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:52,690
Jeep and they're like get on the car and
I'm like they have an English accent

534
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,540
they mean get in the car so I go to the
door in the Lake Nona no get on the car

535
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:02,280
I like just trying to get in the back
seat here now and I noticed the back

536
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,460
seat has rifles and guns spread out all
over it in a bag of Doritos which is

537
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,850
totally weird and the like note get on
the car stand on these the running

538
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:15,220
boards on the side of the car and hold
onto the sunroof and I'm thinking this

539
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,480
is this is either gonna be like
literally said to my friend this is

540
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,400
either gonna be awful greatest story
ever and it's kinda both so we get on

541
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,750
the side running boards and now my oh
that was a mistake because now we're

542
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:34,670
going like 40 miles an hour down the
highway and I thought about talking and

543
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,460
rolling but forty miles an hour outside
the car it looks a lot faster than it

544
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:45,960
does when you're inside the car besides
my broken leg and my two broken arms

545
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,570
after I did that anyway I mean I'm not
even in my hometown I don't know anyone

546
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:54,460
what am I gonna do so I stay on the car
obviously look pretty ridiculous because

547
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,620
cars are honking

548
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:01,280
there's a bus driver and a couple days
on motorbikes are like oh right because

549
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,250
I'm holding a beer and they're throwing
popcorn out of the sunroof and where

550
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,660
make they're making us catch it in our
mouths or tried to anyway which is by

551
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:16,340
the way it possible on the highway forty
miles an hour and I we get the popcorn

552
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,680
you ask they made us rob a popcorn
vendor but I only have a certain amount

553
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,270
of time to tell this story subscribe to
that anyway

554
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:28,640
first of all I'm like this is really
difficult in this beer and you know I

555
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,800
might need another one cuz this popcorn
is really tall tee and then I hear

556
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,180
flashing lights and siren and I think
we're gonna get pulled over and I'm just

557
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,530
gonna tell them exactly what happened I
think this microbes going out and then

558
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:48,590
I'm just gonna lose after we tell them
what's going on and I knew we were in

559
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:55,250
trouble because they refused to stop the
under the window on the comp behind us

560
00:43:55,250 --> 00:44:00,260
turn the lights off and pull back to the
side of the road in now I'm like ok I'm

561
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,430
screwed this is bad news they are above
the law

562
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:09,670
literally so fifteen minutes later we
polluted the secluded neighborhood down

563
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,890
a road into a shuttered up old box and
I'm starting to get jitters even telling

564
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,830
the story and I know it's getting
serious it's not harmless fun anymore

565
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:21,820
like scared the tourists once they took
us inside and we were cut off from the

566
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:26,680
rest of the world we're on our own and
I'm legitimate Lee scared legit scared I

567
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,960
am scared since prom 98 again another
story limited time limited time so he's

568
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,530
yelling at me and pushing me around and
they're kicking the chair that I'm on

569
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,670
cuz they SAT us down its like dank
basement and they like you care about

570
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:44,100
this place you're not here to get
refugees were going to destroy you there

571
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,100
literally thing is because that's like
they've learned English from good

572
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:52,750
crappie VHS tapes so I'm I'm like how do
I read between the lines on this one

573
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:57,020
meanwhile kind of wetting myself and
they're punching my friend in the face

574
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,680
hard because he's got a big mouth he's
all like you don't know who my dad is a

575
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:06,550
lake yet don't care not interested and
white guys I'm just an English teacher

576
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,270
your spot

577
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:14,280
and I'm like nah man I was on my way to
leap nice restaurant in the city where I

578
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,150
was and they've got the best food
anywhere in the city that's all I'm

579
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:23,500
doing here and it goes and goes you
obviously don't know anything about this

580
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,430
country

581
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:30,180
everyone knows Lipa does not have the
best food in the city and I'm like maybe

582
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:35,160
what about snot beat on you and all
grade try to like desperately clean to

583
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,510
any hope I have my money last and he
goes you don't know squat about Serbian

584
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:43,490
food you need to go to you and other
places named I can't remember because I

585
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:48,150
had other things going on at the time
before you can possibly be qualified to

586
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,960
talk about this and it it it's funny cuz
about the story like up with the name of

587
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,780
that restaurant a car try that place
next time so I asked what he wanted when

588
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,370
he goes there he tells me exactly once
again and changed the energy of the

589
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:02,720
whole conversation meanwhile bear in
mind my friend is still getting punched

590
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,900
in the face repeatedly like 10 feet away
from this changing the frame of the

591
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:14,380
conversation goes from him in 1982 us
both on somewhat equal footing we're

592
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,310
talking about Serbian food and culture
and i cant behaving like I'm not in

593
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,350
trouble and I'm like you know later on
when we get out of here wink wink nudge

594
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:27,620
nudge I'm gonna check out there was some
sentiment anchor like any minute now

595
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,970
have a bite to eat sounds good right and
I'm thinking I could really use a drink

596
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:37,010
about now despite being about 8:30 a.m.
it was kinda like this only the food was

597
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:43,110
better and I'm asking advice and where
to go to hang out by the way is called

598
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:47,960
the Benjamin Franklin effect as people
for advice and they start to have a

599
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,290
mutual respect for you it's also in the
challenge but benjamin Franklin famously

600
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:54,680
did this anybody's red Dale Carnegie how
to win friends and influence people to

601
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,420
popular story in a book and then
returned to talk about home-brewed

602
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:04,140
liquor and it's the only thing serbian
people love more than talking about

603
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:10,040
drinking by the way is drinking so like
I said I'm like I need a drink right

604
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,060
about now and she gets up and he's so
he's so chuffed he gets up storms out

605
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:19,360
and that made me really nervous but I'm
just at this point also really glad that

606
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,180
I'm not getting punched in the face

607
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,310
like my trend sometimes they are known
as scarier than the known you know and

608
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,750
at this point I'm looking around my
imagination like filling in the blanks

609
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,870
cause there's all these wires and pipes
sticking out I'm just kind of imagining

610
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:37,110
them clamping them to various parts of
my body and suddenly I see him coming

611
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:41,970
back he's got like a club in his hand
like oh my god ok I got a chump the sky

612
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,930
so I'm like I'm not handcuffed to
restrain a way so I get up in my car I

613
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:51,600
assume some kind of karate pose that's
not super threatening and get ready to

614
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,720
make your move it as he gets closer I'm
thinking okay I've got one chance to do

615
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,860
this this is my one chance for survival
and as it gets within probably I would

616
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,680
say bum rush distance by the way he at
least twice my size this is a terrible

617
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,130
terrible strategy but you know when
you're up in a corner and it's too soon

618
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:13,190
as he gets close enough I see oh my God
he's got a bottle of rocky he's got a

619
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:17,980
bottle of liquor and he sits down and he
pours us a couple of glasses of this

620
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:23,250
battle brew boots now we're really
cranky my friends still getting punched

621
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:23,740
in the face

622
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:29,390
me and him were talking about food women
politics having a heated debate about

623
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,580
where to get the late night street food
in different cities and Serbia and I i

624
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,320
feel for my friend of his point but I'm
just focused on the situation at hand

625
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,440
right now I'm like sorry better you than
me dude that'll teach and I feel like

626
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,790
it's like the airplane oxygen mask where
you help yourself before you help the

627
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:52,420
person next to you and after a while the
other officer says in serving it goes

628
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,470
what are you doing over there having a
party his friends got a big mouth shut

629
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:01,100
it for him and that worries me a lot cuz
I still think this is gonna go sideways

630
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:05,480
right any minute here that you know
they're going to decide okay we're done

631
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,970
lets off these dudes

632
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:11,490
look man I'm sick and I need water we've
been out all night not all day I need

633
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:15,860
water I'm getting woozy these terrible
were drinking so much goes ok ok so he

634
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,660
gets up

635
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:22,250
silence I'm afraid to move at this point
the other guy gets up and after what

636
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:26,130
seems like an eternity I your doors
closing and the car starting and I know

637
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:31,580
they're gone they're gone I'm like oh my
god dude can't get off my friends groggy

638
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:35,550
slow he just got it but we've run as far
as we can he's

639
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,950
like basically crippled so on have
carried him we go to a restaurant in the

640
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:43,640
waitress says hi how can I immediately
turns away and I'm like oh we must look

641
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:49,960
like crap and by the way we were covered
in blood dirt and popcorn and the

642
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,120
regular police come arrest us again take
us to the police station where I try to

643
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,600
explain and broken trunk serbian what
happened in there like the police did

644
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,430
this to you where the police were you
talking about

645
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:04,760
finally calls the captain called his
girlfriend on the phone who's a German

646
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,660
teacher in an English teacher explained
the whole thing to her she happens to

647
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:16,560
know my boss my actual English teaching
boss and now she believes every word

648
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,280
that I'm saying because she's heard
about me my relationships are doing the

649
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:30,420
talking for me right now they cut us
loose and honestly I think the only

650
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,830
thing that saved my life and the life of
my friend at this point in time is

651
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:39,720
surely the relationships that I had
built right when I moved to serbia the

652
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,770
friends we had in common the
professional relationships in the

653
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:47,970
personal relationships she wasn't by my
story until she knew who I was she's

654
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:53,910
embarrassed we're walking home covered
still and dirt blood and popcorn so as

655
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,800
you can see report skills aren't just
good for building connections but in

656
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,360
this case they actually saved my life
and they're the reason I'm talking to

657
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,090
you here today that's my time thank you
everybody
