1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,859
and I think we all need to sit back and
think about what a tremendous asset a

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,240
transfer this entire community and any
Content wouldn't have it would be

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,350
absolutely insane thank you

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:42,940
don't

5
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:54,649
your marketing games 102 much better
like it's much better than a warm can

6
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:58,339
achieve not by choice

7
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:20,780
trent horrible but how far is it dawned
on me that John I won't do it all rights

8
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:27,950
this off and really we're coming out the
schedules we look at Derby Conn is is

9
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,780
really you know who can get in here that
can you know research on mass amount of

10
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,190
audiences and talk of folks in what I
want to do you want to bring a lot of

11
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,360
folks that I respect a whole lot in this
industry folks that I've learned off I

12
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,159
looked up to you and I still do

13
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:55,239
Sept literally looking up to us right
now looking down to meet each di know

14
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,899
when I was getting this industry I
remember popping Metasploit Framework to

15
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:02,959
that was running Perl the time and no
longer however popping a skate

16
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:09,099
infrastructure you know anything was
better prepared to yes yes oh you know

17
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:13,810
it was her popping a boxer and getting
access that has a cool thing ever and I

18
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,980
was in the Marines doing all this stuff
and you know he's one of my heroes

19
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,670
growing up in you know a growing up in
the speaking at he's done at Nickerson

20
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,560
who you know had a TV show it is Mike
talked about you know what time you guys

21
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,580
should watch that show and then email
Chris about how much you like that show

22
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:39,590
and John everybody else that does really
dedicated their careers industry more so

23
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,650
not just for me career perspective but
their lives in in what they try to do

24
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,050
the community so I wanted to get them
all together and hopefully do some open

25
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,909
dialogue on honest I'm just gonna be
here to facilitate communications what I

26
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:53,340
like to do is if we could have audio on
his petition participation to be like to

27
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,230
ask any questions you want to you

28
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,200
underway or whatever is fine it doesn't
matter it's wide open thing here do you

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,299
are not well sorry but it's it's wide
open dialogue here they want to do a

30
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,379
kind of talk about where we're at as far
as the industry so I'll kick it off to

31
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:09,909
you guys

32
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:29,049
the series base kit with my legs up w
you this goes here goes here so good

33
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:39,090
almost done now you guys read everything
is back to normal thank you are corn

34
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,700
alright so obviously we see a lot of
recent things like that in the media

35
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,950
today that's a big thing that is taking
over the media taking over what we hear

36
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,730
from Board of Directors it's taking over
what we deal with on a regular basis so

37
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,910
all praises the panel here why so many
breaches right now why so many bridges

38
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:15,919
address chris Christie are you going to
tell you I blame Metasploit so what is

39
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:24,220
it is Josh Corman remember the quote
about yell so I'm sure with H D Moore's

40
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,720
Law h2 you're familiar with it right

41
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,680
the idea is if your security defenses
are not getting better at least the rate

42
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,820
that medicine capabilities are
increasing you will get oh and i think

43
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,810
is irrefutable laws really so anyway so
claiming that split the thing is when

44
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:50,410
they do that breaches are investigating
no fence H D but but but but medicine is

45
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,660
driving a lot of the invasion there and
back as use those techniques if not the

46
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,720
specific told him that if you look at
the client side exploits the fanatic

47
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,310
about his way to the last four or five
years almost every single one is based

48
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,010
on a public sample being spotted a while
before we got to it so it's not that

49
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,469
that's why striving industry is that the
black acid driving history we're trying

50
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:13,659
to keep up at this point

51
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:19,030
dilemma leasing information to the
public to protect themselves versus

52
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,880
having the Black Cats have everything
they want access to dinner to do it I'm

53
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,110
a big believer in disclosure so it's one
of those arguments we've been fighting

54
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,440
for years I don't understand why
anybody's on the other side we have to

55
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:40,700
have to play I don't think more people
are getting owned I think we have more

56
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,169
complaints and more things that give us
his ability to know that we got on but I

57
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,810
think the same amount of people are
getting on that used to be just say

58
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,450
though that the industry has grown no
mean both on on a look at audiences at

59
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,240
conferences ten years ago we don't have
conferences like this is because they

60
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,260
were you know I mean what you say that
the industry has gotten bigger on both

61
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,320
sides black and white hair which means
that more attacks occurred

62
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,260
kind of screw that point I'm how many of
you guys are in roles that you consider

63
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,970
him a text you doing defense and
offensive reorganization you just call

64
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,770
please raise your hands so you look at
the vast majority of people that attend

65
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,680
these kinds of people that are trying to
do both roles they're trying to be

66
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,170
defenders the trying to understand the
office to do better and it's very very

67
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:34,470
hard servers both masters very good
things interesting goes then what we

68
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,280
need to do to fix that what we need to
do as an industry to get better at

69
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,080
defending and how does that impact our
industry that were in a lot of us ran on

70
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,550
the pen testing field or Brett see me or
whatever you wanna call it what's what's

71
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,730
our goal to get better as an industry
sure so so I think an evolution and let

72
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,410
people talk about this last couple of
years but we really need to get our our

73
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,610
game on there's there's a talk about his
not vulnerable assessment is actually

74
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,540
been testing but I think the young that
it's it's going from pen testing to

75
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,860
actual threat emulation Raphael much
talked about a lot of stuff you know

76
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,970
that he's doing HD's work right
emulations that you can say not just you

77
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,070
have a small mobility we were able to
pivot three organization after we

78
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,980
exploit it and wow that's bad news for
it but to map it to a real-world bad guy

79
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,060
could do that that makes it much more
interesting to the business decision

80
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,150
makers and it'll let us get the
resources we need to defend

81
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:35,960
organizations I if I may so it is
absolutely correct we have to be doing

82
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,760
at this aerial mapping but one of the
things that I've been working on for a

83
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,170
little while now that once it's finished
to a point where it's usable we're going

84
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,250
to release it open source is someone
calling adversarial insight and it's the

85
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:55,440
ability not just to say I miss school
hacker and I can do this and I can do

86
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,180
these need attacks but to actually
quantify how well the defense is

87
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,870
detecting you right we we talked a lot
about I get in every time I get in every

88
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:11,070
time I get in overtime that's really not
an important metric we also write the

89
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,490
metric we really need to look at the
heat workmanship so nor they used it but

90
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,330
how well they detect us how would they
have responded if they had seen the

91
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,319
attacks that we did because if we're not
helping them improve that all we're

92
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,020
doing is shown how we are taking their
money

93
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,949
a great point the other thing talking
about what we can do is spend testers

94
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:37,430
offensive pace right we have to try that
that's cool but most of us are here

95
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,050
because we like to break things keep
doing what you're doing the reason why I

96
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,490
say that is because go outside of this
industry a lot of people say we hate

97
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,620
people who write her final bill we hate
people who write exploits we hate people

98
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,080
that break into organizations because
they're just breaking things I say

99
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,190
that's that's crap keep doing what
you're doing all structure all

100
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,089
architectures based on understanding
failure points and that's what we're

101
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,880
doing in this industry is finding those
failure points so keep finding them keep

102
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,180
identifying as failure points just
things are only fragile they break just

103
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,760
had a conversation the hallway with with
some folks who work in a large

104
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,980
enterprise and it near the conversation
had about a month ago with another

105
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,600
organization is doing some cutting edge
stuff and it's it's the idea that you

106
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,860
you have your pen testers you read teams
do what they do but you set a metric of

107
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,160
how quickly the blue team can detect
them with a month ago said their initial

108
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,220
metric is they wanted to be able to text
the bad guy in the presence the red team

109
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,010
within the space of two weeks and it was
hard they struggle finding a move in two

110
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,329
weeks they did they upped their game
they got better since his red making

111
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:49,529
boom better and then they lowered their
their metric to one way and then they

112
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:52,649
lowered it to two days and now they're
down to about an hour and a half but

113
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:58,220
this also challenges read that read more
innovative and impersonator or mimic or

114
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,029
map to more sophisticated attackers and
I think this is beautiful red and blue

115
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:07,160
working together I sometimes say I'm
ready I'm offensive you know through

116
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,960
three effect if you cut me I bleed red
that's how ready I am

117
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,810
but that said the purpose of red in this
context really weird by the way but

118
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,430
don't we do not need to do a live
experiment with that thank you Chris we

119
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:28,120
tested but but the purpose of red never
lose sight of this the purpose of red is

120
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:41,210
to me better and it's a beautiful thing
going on the offensive and defensive

121
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,230
folks Marion from that is the best I
mean I i seek time and time again where

122
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,380
you know a company focuses on their
defensive capabilities in the blue team

123
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,560
just focuses on what they know in their
environment they don't know how its

124
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,260
actors breaking know how coffee goes
after things and I've actually found

125
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,740
that by doing you know the the whole red
to blue team piece I learned a whole lot

126
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,750
on the red team side because I learn how
people defend better learn all this work

127
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,490
i can use for another customer and say
hey I've seen this work and stop us

128
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,020
before detectives that I haven't seen
before in the past for this is something

129
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,070
that made me do my technique different
change my technique different because of

130
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,350
that so it makes us better which is also
when for us to do with you know also

131
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,910
helps us to understand what you know is
out there what's stopping us and what's

132
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,170
not usually I mean I would say what you
already this 99% time it's not a piece

133
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:37,960
of technology so what's the wire we as
an industry I guess focusing on the

134
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,330
technology peace forces the people peace
you go into you and I T organization

135
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,880
that she has three hundred folks
dedicate eighteen the usually have one

136
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,930
person dedicated to security now is that
feasible an accompanying can somebody

137
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,340
that one person team or two-person team
or even a five-person team that ratio

138
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,450
compete and actually defend an
organization

139
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,650
the scale of the whole premise behind I
T and technology in the first place so

140
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,320
you can scale one person's a huge
organizations with not as much

141
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,880
investment so we're still doing things
always but have tons of other bands out

142
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,460
there now we have very few numbers
batman's doing these things like that

143
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,720
bob smart management schools and so on
and so of course when you start fighting

144
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,600
abilities you find ways to trick them or
waste of using technology get access to

145
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,960
much more than ever in the past so
security being everyone's responsibility

146
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,270
in an organization is one of the
powerful ways that like offensive minded

147
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:33,430
folks can teach the defenceman intro to
the folks are just keeping things

148
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,610
running I created a class few years ago
when I was still my former employer

149
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,750
called defend the flag and it was
designed for like I T professionals who

150
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:49,060
literally had no attack background
whatsoever to come in two days and in

151
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,950
the morning of the first day they would
learn her starting stuff in the

152
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,280
afternoon they would use an exploit
framework like men estoy to launch

153
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:03,340
attacks the next day they took turns
blue team in red team because prior to

154
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,730
that a lot of his works at never had
exposure to even notice which sounds

155
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,970
incredible but how many of your I T
folks who are not security focused how

156
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,550
many of them actually have ever run
medicine

157
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:19,280
shaking your head snow so just the power
of teaching the defenders you know that

158
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:26,120
in fact understanding how easy it can be
to perform a fence especially on those

159
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,000
on hardened like soft chewy center
networks that we've seen so many times

160
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,090
and gets them to take responsibility for
the security of the entire network

161
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,470
knowing that there's no real perimeter
that you're absolutely correct one of

162
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,450
the things that we've been pushing in
our organization and through

163
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:48,570
presentations of things we're doing is
trying to stop this mindset that

164
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,730
security is different

165
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:58,740
what I do is QA the only difference
between me when I pen test a web app in

166
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,889
the queue a person who is testing the
web app is that when they find a bug

167
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:07,920
they open up a ticket and they bitch at
a developer when I find above figure out

168
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:15,440
what I can do with it that's right they
get upset I giggle right so weak start

169
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,279
if we stop focusing on security is
something that's completely separate if

170
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,889
we stop trying to treated as this White
Tower that we have to be in because

171
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:28,260
we're better than they are and start
really just accepting the fact that they

172
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,920
can do what we do if we empower them to
will all be better in a case like that

173
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,500
one person can scale to defend right but
if you don't have that buying if you're

174
00:14:39,500 --> 00:15:03,940
not being inclusive then you're never
gonna do its gonna fit as I will so I

175
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:12,690
have have something that I'm burning
tattoo that when days sent out the email

176
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:19,360
asking us to be on the panel it was this
future of security thing right and and I

177
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,720
took that seriously to appoint

178
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:32,209
security because my next question about
what's going on around here and in my

179
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:42,560
eyes and I can talk about things now but
but I didn't I myself didn't have a

180
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,360
clear idea of what I thought things were
going to be like twenty years thirty or

181
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,769
forty years and in order to do that you
normally have to try and find a similar

182
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:57,269
Avenue something that we've done before
that we know that would apply the same

183
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:01,370
basic principles whether we're going
from point A to point C and a trainer

184
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,040
jet we're still going from A to Z

185
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,899
and I think Kevin kills it right where
we're a quality assurance industry

186
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:19,529
that's what we do we we we've mirrored
since 1958 we've mirrored everything

187
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:27,100
that you see QA and testing operation
does but we're really really slow like

188
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:36,380
our industries really slow we're really
think we're really important which we're

189
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:43,940
we're just like the QAQC people in the
sixties and seventies we have a huge

190
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,579
level of skill required for us to do our
job and we have to go through all of

191
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:55,529
these different iterations to make sure
that the code that's produced works so

192
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:59,670
ended in the fifties and sixties they
had to put that under control by

193
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,240
creating style and programming didn't
even have generic standards they just

194
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,130
had a style but you just have to put
arabs in spacing to make it look like

195
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,470
this so that people are totally confused
then the sixties to the seventies they

196
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,520
started to make standardization right so
not only is it stopped I know but we

197
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,620
actually have to have these basic
functions we have to call traditional

198
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:28,710
sets of libraries that other people know
our standard right then we get from the

199
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,220
seventies to the eighties and we start
actually doing testing Merkel's makes

200
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:38,049
the books called black box testing right
it's a software quality assurance that

201
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:42,440
every single one of us has heard the
term black box testing and most people

202
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,480
don't even know what the hell it comes
from and it's from the software QA so

203
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,010
now we have a standard of how do we test
thing we've never been involved it then

204
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,419
you go with the eighties nineties and we
start getting automated

205
00:17:55,419 --> 00:18:01,470
now we have testing frameworks from the
testing frameworks be then go into now

206
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,490
that we have automated smarter now we
have to move from the QA person that

207
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,410
understands how to code

208
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:14,550
this is the part that really hurts from
coding in machine language everything

209
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,600
else in the fifties sixties and
seventies down too well I kinda only

210
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,590
need to know how to do these pieces of
code because some of the automation

211
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:28,460
frameworks over my responsibilities so
now I need to know how to manage the bug

212
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,050
and with the bug goes to end as well as
fix the book but that as the framework

213
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:38,460
starts to get smarter the person who's
doing the testing has to get less kill

214
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:46,230
you don't get more skill get more money
you're gonna get less because now I

215
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,850
don't know all that really advanced
super ninja shit I have to do is know

216
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:56,570
that when red light comes up it's a bug
fix the book will then you get from the

217
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:03,360
nineties into the 2000 and from the 2009
we start to have are made in animation

218
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,580
happens we're all these bugs I don't
even have to fix them anymore I just go

219
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,550
ahead software is back to the person who
created the shitty coat and it's like a

220
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,070
problem and you put a button and it goes
back to the new yorker person so now the

221
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:22,270
QA person has almost no skill other than
project management and how to use the

222
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:28,540
free so the reason I say all of that is
because when I look at the quality

223
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,120
assurance world and how the quality
assurance world in the engineering

224
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,090
talent when you used to have very very
highly skilled highly engaged very very

225
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,360
technical people to head to do that
stuff now the people who are in the QA

226
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,490
world at the beginning of the QA because
there's tears right here the people who

227
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,710
are still doing that but there was such
a limited talent pool shocking just like

228
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,580
us there is such a limited talent pool
that the business had to go to automate

229
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,030
and when we automate these things
magically we can hire somebody for

230
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,520
twenty grand to do the job instead of
two hundred and do the job so my idea

231
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,110
future security is there anybody who's a
pen tester right now makes a hundred and

232
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,310
fifty grand is going to make thirty
grant future

233
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:26,110
I disagree somewhat I disagree somewhat
I disagree because the complexity of the

234
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,560
system that we're dealing with we're not
just dealing with coats hats that we

235
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,150
have today we have to deal with all the
code sets from yesterday

236
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,590
every year progresses in the snowball
trapped in your environment Stearns and

237
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,820
gets bigger and bigger many of your
environment not getting rid of the

238
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,060
school code and we still have these
vulnerabilities that exists and it's not

239
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,340
just the vulnerabilities and that's part
of the problem and that's one of the

240
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,280
things associated with it with a good
Pentastar good pen testing company a red

241
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,180
team company company is the ability to
go beyond just looking for standard

242
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,120
possibilities that exist but you and I
were talking before I believe that there

243
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,820
is a crash that's going to be coming to
this industry a lot of it has to do with

244
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,590
what he just said because we're allowing
this industry as Penn dusters to get

245
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,450
completely taken over by automation
tools how many guys have seen tools over

246
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,360
the past year that say we ought to me

247
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,490
Appendix C if you guys could be replaced
by an automated tool you will so many

248
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,210
things at night talked about quite a bit
about Pinterest puppy mills to go

249
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,420
through and automate all of these things
and those things are not those are not

250
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,960
ready

251
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:30,450
it's a test case like making the same
dying breath request that coders did

252
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:37,170
eighties in inside you're going to make
sure I'm still important you know what

253
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:43,380
that's good that's a good script you
absolutely good and you know what

254
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,710
one of the things I didn't think that
you didn't talk about to shut up

255
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,120
is isn't it awesome because of all the
automation and all the wonderful news

256
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:58,500
that they had seventies sixties and
eighties that we now have secure code we

257
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:05,020
need an expert with how many of you have
actually had ok hands in the Ayer pense

258
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:11,210
testers former current whatever alright
keep them in the Premier keeping their

259
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,860
game up you yes here

260
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:20,830
how many of you actually had to use a
zero day in a pen test in order to

261
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:24,850
successfully bones something had to no
other way

262
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:34,040
ok because of the contract doesn't count
doesn't count right very so we're all

263
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,210
talking about like being automated way
but actually only have bugs in the code

264
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:45,280
but actually we we don't necessarily
have you know she rode a problem we have

265
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,179
a patching problem we have a patch
deployment problem how many times you

266
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:56,590
know we're ripping through using a day's
not too many that's a big burn for an

267
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,860
hour a day using on so I mean this has
been going on for quite some time so

268
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,470
what do you think actually makes
organizations care about security

269
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,650
breaches ok but let's let's let's look
at that

270
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:16,780
example right so only money yes but what
happens in a case of any old enough to

271
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:27,799
remember who paris Hilton is okay so
remember when Paris Hilton sidekick

272
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:35,590
remember that we're talking about the
dog this has nothing to do you know imma

273
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:42,990
let you finish but so anyway but the dog
had nothing to do with the point ones

274
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:48,030
the demographic the pop the Sidekick
that was interested in paris Hilton did

275
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:53,490
not care that there was a breach and it
was all over the papers they couldn't

276
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,980
keep the site keeps you on the shelves
after that happened that was the classic

277
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:03,390
case of security actually did not result
a big reach did not result in a loss of

278
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,799
customers or revenue so how do you
actually get the organizations that you

279
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:12,059
work for two staff you up with the
resources you need give you the tools

280
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:16,970
you need is you might actually need a
few and give you there you know

281
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:22,100
the charter to do what you need to do
you essentially don't have to have the

282
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,590
same goals in order for them to be
aligned just think about your

283
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,480
organization and what is it that you
were actually trying to protect what did

284
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,150
they hire you to do

285
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,570
wasn't to prevent breaches if it was to
prevent loss of revenue due to security

286
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:41,690
issues so once you kind of figure that
out with your business networking Pat

287
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:50,330
Derby wonder on I have not slept it once
you figure that out then you'll start to

288
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,559
actually unlock some of the resources
they have for you and you'll get more

289
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,710
support you'll get more respect and
you'll get more training and get sent to

290
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,980
Derby Conn over and over the cycle
continues

291
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,570
Chris makes a very thought-provoking
point about the quality software but we

292
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,400
can't lose sight of you up right mister
Chris had made easy so around social

293
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,860
engineering right plus just the abuse of
legitimate credentials and the clever

294
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:21,000
use of that to demonstrate business I
remember when I first started in

295
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,250
information security I was it built for
my office mates with rich gravy and he

296
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,690
was one of the head cryptographer zabell
he was a grumpy old map is wonderful i

297
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,240
learned so much from it and he said to
me I was a young kid right I had a tie

298
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:42,140
on everything that's how we roll in
those days I had hair so so great men

299
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,890
turn is like my second day in office he
said can't rely on just information

300
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,600
security issues in 1990

301
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,280
6 said I'm telling you five or 10 years
they're going to figure this thing out

302
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,440
there gonna fix all of our own clothes
would have cryptography done right and

303
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,960
training users well and your best bet is
to get out of interest within five or 10

304
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,130
years I was like ok I believe it that's
it that's the way it's going to be and

305
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,970
when Chris made his argument about the
software quality stuff it remind you of

306
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,220
what rich said and it's

307
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:23,679
I just don't see it going I think I'll
ever been testers will continue with no

308
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,659
man agree with him and the reason why it
is but I'm debating with myself and

309
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:32,220
someone but the reason why I agree with
them as I do believe that this industry

310
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,130
is coming down to a crash because this
industry is allowing itself something

311
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:41,200
that is automated animation and it's
quickly becoming something that you know

312
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,539
company I could hire trusts or I could
go higher Pinterest and they do it 10

313
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:54,789
times but this tool magically does a pen
test and we're allowing that to happen

314
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:58,580
and and I believe that we're gonna have
a crash but I still believe that there

315
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,669
have been doing it right now will
continue to do so but but I do somewhat

316
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:05,450
agree with Chris there is a crash that
is going to occur like you said going

317
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,640
452 30 maybe a bit drastic but we got
prepared for it I'm not talking about

318
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:19,380
tomorrow I mean I'm talking about forty
years I'm not saying we finally have my

319
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,679
day we have had reports secure overboard
by then yeah sure I'm sure your Facebook

320
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:34,799
trust me I understand how much you know
but but at the same time there's going

321
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,230
to be good testers but can I take that
same good tester and go hey what did you

322
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,549
learn in this test and then have
somebody who's a good test building

323
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:49,429
engineer and so at what point are you
gonna be John Henry versus the machine

324
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:52,659
and I

325
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:58,899
that realistically week we have to at
some point except that the the landscape

326
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:04,119
expands so fast and we don't have the
talent pool to covered landscape that we

327
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:10,220
need the augmentation ok week we need it

328
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,509
everybody in the room you have to get
some viagra me whatever you need to

329
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:25,729
change in order so so but that's the
only one that can do and i cant security

330
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:34,450
but I think that we need to embrace some
of this automation we need to embrace

331
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:41,470
the way that that really that he has
helped pioneer the integration of some

332
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,700
of these things in a framework that
allows rapid iteration of testing if

333
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,809
we're gonna have you know a Joe
programming at Roland rapid testing and

334
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:56,070
and we can do that we don't have the
skills we don't have the talent pool to

335
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,039
cover that rapid iteration of testing
without using the augmentation that we

336
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,710
have and making that augmentation better
over there isn't it awesome that we have

337
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:09,090
each team or writing side shotgun on
almost every one of us but that's that's

338
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:22,659
what I'm talking about a picture of him
as my homeboy like little

339
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:29,859
unrelated to that comment my view on how
to write a lot of ways we're still the

340
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:34,109
high-growth phase technology adoption so
where were we can't secure things as

341
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:36,859
fast as we're going to build them and
that's why we're all valuable in this

342
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:42,129
room and yes we do not need to make sure
that when you go on site last

343
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:46,879
thirty-five thousand job that's the
place to do your job better doesn't

344
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:50,659
replace here are some other shit out
there that you need to get that you

345
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:54,840
can't spend time wanna be so that's kind
of a viewpoint

346
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,150
you know security testing tools for
donations my perspective it is a

347
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:12,790
question that isn't there find
everything that's not what I mean if you

348
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,860
look at companies and other structures
let's take any company and the industry

349
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,030
review whatsoever they still have to
have people that build airplanes that

350
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,770
understand aerodynamics understand
mechanics understand technology make the

351
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,940
technology better you can automate
everything has to be a balance between

352
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,810
then I mean she said

353
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:33,010
automation piece of looking for all of
our abilities is great that's fine you

354
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,030
know we we should have that but that's
not how attackers and go after companies

355
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,300
so we have to differentiate those
different groups and focus on those

356
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,710
skill sets in this industry keep it
going I agree to Chris's point we have

357
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:49,960
we have to balance automation manual
because there isn't enough there's no if

358
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,280
we went to this gap like we're in for a
sec was like hey does a couple of people

359
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,220
ministry you know a few people ex parte
hanging out to a full-fledged industry

360
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,320
and so there's always people who are
experts in this initiative we figured

361
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,260
out you know what to do and then there
is a huge gap of influx of security we

362
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,230
didn't have anybody that was beginning
or anybody else intermediary or anybody

363
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:12,470
else in between so now we have his brand
new industry with with the folks that

364
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:17,700
don't have the skill set yet but they
will we still have to use it on a

365
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,970
mission peace dogma that point sounds
like real terms of automation and and

366
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:31,130
the fact that there are there's there's
a dearth of new talent coming in the

367
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:40,320
morning you're welcome but I think that
sharpening the tool just not just

368
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,890
talking about like hers but the Thunder
will find the crash the artist the one

369
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:49,600
who finds whether or not that crashes
exploited well if we can sharpen the

370
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,470
tool that that enable that artist that's
something that includes the skills gap

371
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:02,260
that we desperately need on the defense
side so tools are great but it's where

372
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,190
exactly in you know in the vulnerability
and expandability discovery he handles

373
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,090
most effective

374
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,500
and then get back to this idea of you
balling from pen testing to threaten

375
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,059
escalation that you can provide
additional business value to them you

376
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:22,779
can order me a lot and you should I meet
you can but posing as a mindset at the

377
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:31,010
organization that i dont think Ill be
able to at least in the near-term so I

378
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:41,220
get when we got here so my hand others
brought that up but Christian shared a

379
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:47,110
really great article about finding a
bunch of vulnerabilities in person to

380
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:52,380
see you know some of the best people and
projects here on things like that you

381
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,020
know they're increasingly automating and
so you know people like that how to do

382
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,669
it

383
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:04,390
would you like a lot of people kind of
all that example so one of its members

384
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:09,279
of project zero is a metonymic James for
shy and used to work for a small

385
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,520
consultancy out of the UK and I know
James pretty well because I wrote him a

386
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,330
check for $100,000

387
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:22,270
this one time a blue hat and for what
for what you s well I'll tell you it was

388
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:31,740
it was not gonna get weird ok no I wrote
him a check for $100,000 because he

389
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,270
found a new medication bypass or related
that the time version of Windows fully

390
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,600
patched etcetera

391
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,250
so he he came up with a new attack
technique essentially and that was rare

392
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,470
enough in that program is still ongoing
and paying out a hundred grand for a new

393
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,580
expectation techniques on the latest
version of Windows but the point that

394
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,570
you were saying about they use fathers
they're using automation James does not

395
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:02,600
James does not and a lot of the best
artists in this industry and yes you are

396
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,410
rockstars yes

397
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:09,390
do not use Pfizer's they are there new
and they see the lady in the red dress

398
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:15,640
and that is how they do it literally
when I met him in a few years to get him

399
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:21,800
to agree to answer this particular
program that I started microsoft I said

400
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:29,770
to him I was like no I know you can do
this terrible accident anyway I've never

401
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:35,669
never really looked outside of dotnet
I've only been believed in you have a

402
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:41,230
beer you know and so he got permission
from his employer took him three weeks

403
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:48,740
three weeks of sharing that lady Jill
that red dress appeared and he wrote up

404
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:53,290
the exploit fully bypass tears lined up
all the other medications on the

405
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,900
platform he wrote a beautiful white
paper I wrote him a check for $100,000

406
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:12,390
no fathers involved once you check for
$100,000 in his attack

407
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:30,820
well I mean didn't you automate him know
so the issue that came up no make sure

408
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,740
that like oh and automate him out

409
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,080
know so the problem is you know
essentially medication bypass requires

410
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,790
like architectural changes to the
operating system that will take time to

411
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,550
implement roll out and not break
everything you know that it's ever been

412
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,250
before

413
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:55,990
will again in the future so there's
still unmitigated make it has bugs

414
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:01,140
ok so now we're talking about here but
what i'm saying is the fact is not only

415
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,320
did he identify these new attack
techniques not only are there still

416
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,320
unmitigated parts of it but variations
could be discovered

417
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,130
maybe have been discovered by people in
this room already and it would be great

418
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,559
if yes he kept looking for that one

419
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:21,499
red dress and yes he is talent as many
of those people are and that's why I

420
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:25,400
called condone exploit our walk you know
because these are the artist

421
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,519
how incredibly complex is gone over the
years when you look at traditional

422
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,319
versus what we have to do today in order
to get remote code execution I mean it's

423
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:37,289
it's insane but that takes a person
manually to do that to go after it

424
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:46,130
don't they become automated after that
sort of look like FL right like he's my

425
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:50,239
hero and I felt like I need a belt out
of my chest this point because he's

426
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:55,509
killed more bugs than any human on this
planet it's good to be back with the

427
00:36:55,509 --> 00:37:06,289
lower actually step back but if you look
like that the class the bug me it feels

428
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:13,769
like you're better off a lot of times
but same time mainly go find this

429
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:19,489
initial areas outside this both pieces
to it while also getting back to the

430
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:22,640
point about the found about the
automated it we don't need him anymore

431
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,819
we do need him anymore I think that's
kind of a moot point because all

432
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:29,650
structural engineering as an
understanding of failure points every

433
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,979
single trust as a pillar point every
single to buy for his failure point the

434
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:37,479
doors have failure points and they
record those failure point and just

435
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:40,229
because we can automate that we still
have structural engineers that

436
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:43,150
understand those failure points and
their research those failure points and

437
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,819
he still great-great-great architectures
so moving forward I believe the pen

438
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:50,390
testing is going to be like the
structural engineers for architecture of

439
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,150
I T systems we know that failure points
we understand where those failure points

440
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,569
are and we could develop mitigation so
if one trust one computer collapses or

441
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:05,119
fail and doesn't lead to a total
catastrophic failure of the architecture

442
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,140
so 10 minutes ago

443
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:19,930
chris is going on about this story
problem because if you can you can use

444
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:27,680
automation to free up from the you know
the people in crap compliance record you

445
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,170
know you're saying you can hire trusted
sec or so if a popular tool

446
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,599
well I think part of the problem is that
you're saying well are those all

447
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,299
equivalent and just know they aren't
there are places that you know we need a

448
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:50,400
pen test your first check box they're
gonna go with the tool but you know

449
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,269
there's reasons that they would do that
but they also need to understand no

450
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:59,349
they're not getting the same thing you
know if you want to push the envelope

451
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:05,839
and staff are you human factor in
everything involved so I would love to

452
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:13,210
see if there was an entry level position
like just the tool but we're a business

453
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:22,140
also understands still need to have your
augment that with rocks and an artist at

454
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,819
work with the same thing but one is so
much more

455
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:35,640
this is something I think that is a gap
in how weird is that when we say I had a

456
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:43,980
Pinto done that is such a variety of
things as somebody who has looked at too

457
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,059
many pen test results from lots of
different companies I will tell you that

458
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:56,700
the results you get black hills or or
whoever is way different than the result

459
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:05,329
you get from that company over there not
naming names but

460
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:14,910
so the problems we treat those the same
and I think and I know this is going to

461
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,049
be a horrible thing to say

462
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:24,349
PC I did something right just recently
right they said yes

463
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:33,690
follow some executions standard one we
may know about the right if you're not

464
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,819
following this standard this is
something I've talked about for years

465
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:46,150
I've thrown up the idea of regulation
certification some type of way to say I

466
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:51,319
know what I'm doing and I met this level
whatever that level happens to be and

467
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:55,930
then the people who just want to check
box the idiots right they can go get the

468
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:02,099
check box but everybody will know it's
just a checkbox this is John Phan said

469
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,459
this years ago I agreed with 100% then I
agree with it

470
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:10,709
200% now every single one of our report
standards to be possible if any pen

471
00:41:10,709 --> 00:41:14,609
tester says to you I can't show you one
of my reports you need to punch him in

472
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:20,579
the throat and kick him out of your
building right for her whatever whatever

473
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:38,949
it is we need to set people like that on
fire right so so I don't think that

474
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:47,199
we've got that we have a number where I
don't think they're idiots for choosing

475
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,670
people are idiots for choosing that low
end penned that low in Pentastar think

476
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,579
they weren't there I think it's an
uneducated market and we will educate

477
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:59,390
them we will talk about the differences
between Penn tests but let me say if we

478
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,890
ever get to that to that poor story and
for me it's a horror story at least the

479
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:09,930
Chris's describing where everyone says
okay this is a this is John Henry thing

480
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:14,170
john henry was a nice linear race who
can get to the end it's that simple

481
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,690
mention it never looks like a simple
mission you can get to the end of it

482
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,910
pen test first the computer the human
and they get different billable rates

483
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,990
and so on

484
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:27,610
I think like a whole industry just
collapses we have no pen test was left

485
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:32,160
we've got a tiny number of entities who
make less than the receptionists I think

486
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,320
if we get to that point the black hats
are going to do the education for us

487
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,330
because you'll have all of these
companies that got pen test that all

488
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:44,960
checked their box that all have the
automated pending got the very best tool

489
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,390
can point to that tool as long as you
got the logo on your website and the

490
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:55,620
Black Cats will just to run over and
we'll have wonderfully great results I

491
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,300
mean wonderfully horrible results

492
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,130
alright but I know its education someone
to do it for us if we can't do it so

493
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,140
you're talking about

494
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,150
undereducated market could you could you
perhaps be talking about there's a

495
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,310
there's an S at the end

496
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:16,960
HTTP there's a refined yeah there's a
lock this in a good yeah it said secure

497
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,700
there was a green you know all of these
things right that we we've essentially

498
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:30,130
like dumbed it down train them to think
that that's it right and I mean as as an

499
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:36,580
old and Esther I can tell you with my
advanced age at the beginning of

500
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:43,260
application and penetration testing it
was a matter of that same education and

501
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:47,620
attacks and breaches are getting more
numerous I don't think they're picking

502
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,450
up on the west is what I'm saying I mean
this is Ben like literally I I was

503
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,150
printing fifteen years ago

504
00:43:54,150 --> 00:44:01,480
yeah so anyway but it was this was the
lesson that we were trying to shout from

505
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,040
the rooftops one you'll never be a
hundred percent accurate determine a

506
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,640
bursary will be able to penetrate your
network no matter what

507
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,280
to that little lock doesn't mean
anything the less at the end

508
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,130
lovely but that had nothing to do with
application layer vulnerabilities try

509
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:19,770
harder three you know all of the tools
and all of the pen test that you do and

510
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:25,970
all the QA that we do you're never gonna
find all the bugs and so

511
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:30,280
with all of us i'm i'm wondering why
we're even worried about tools and

512
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:37,900
automation taking our jobs and and even
if even if the tools and automation

513
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,750
could potentially commoditized are where
you know and and down level are paid

514
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:48,380
raids and what not at all can't actually
do true risk assessment can't empathize

515
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:52,070
with the business of what I was saying
earlier figure out what it is the

516
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,070
business cares about the tool is not
going to be able to tell them you know

517
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:01,150
that the sky falling here is going to
cost you this case he's trying awfully

518
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:08,470
hard to convince us that she's old
enough to drink just one quick look at

519
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:15,300
both tests were inherently lazy trend
we're gonna take the low-hanging fruit

520
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,160
use that to get in so that automation is
to take away the pain for its when you

521
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,660
have a real time so we try to emulate
attacker don't just walk in and use the

522
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,690
same thing that you know he would you in
five seconds so that's the goal

523
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,250
automation is not see you for internal
organizations with automated test ideas

524
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,310
to get those pics and things that I was
just breeze through the next month just

525
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,250
make them work for a little bit more so
and you know you asked a question about

526
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:44,160
what the future entails kind of going on
that it's not a huge tits sworn I need

527
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:52,970
them medic to the delinquency of a minor
the device to make ice medic

528
00:45:52,970 --> 00:46:00,930
actually warrants cold temperature goes
down your throat much I resent my call

529
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:07,940
for a net so so you know we're talking
about PCIe 3.0 and HDMI away from Kevin

530
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,690
and I know I agree with PCIe 3.0
basically declining in going very

531
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:18,650
clearly and saying this is not a test
this is what you have to do I think that

532
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,430
helps was gonna drive the industry in
the next five years far more than PCR

533
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,180
anything else

534
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:30,930
churns companies were gonna refused bail
premiums for companies get hacked and

535
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:36,290
then the PCI compliance with the also
define like you don't you're not texting

536
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,700
anymore from the cardholder data from
your testing

537
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,810
anything that could impact the
cardholder environment which is the most

538
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:46,750
the best thing that you could have ever
met and how many of us are now going to

539
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:52,050
you know companies that want their PCI
DSS hey so here is our defined list of

540
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:56,480
what you can attack is now that's not
what he says anymore you do anything we

541
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:02,660
want you to get a fireman and last year
we only spent $5,000 per pen testing was

542
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,480
just these two servers

543
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,280
anything that supports reconstruct that
can impact the environment is now in

544
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,150
scope which is a great thing for PCI
everybody hates it and companies say

545
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:16,380
nobody's complaining about it and I mean
it's great to see it actually made some

546
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,359
changes definitions that Manchester I
mean it's showing maturity they were

547
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:25,810
getting too I think we're gonna eat yet
important export your Christian forty

548
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,119
years ok

549
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:32,829
forty years doesn't like people anymore

550
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:53,230
545 robots here to TV shows to be there
all robots 3

551
00:47:53,230 --> 00:48:05,760
yeah this is something they did touched
on earlier and I think this is where and

552
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,800
testers always have a job if I might
quote the first one vote Mr robot one of

553
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,630
the things he says during that series
it's just outstanding is it says I have

554
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:21,839
people and that's how bad guys getting
organizations nowadays we we know that

555
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,950
we know it's about social engineering we
know it's not getting people to do

556
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:29,930
something that they would not normally
do in that takes research that only it's

557
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:34,079
not something that I think you cannot
and so that that part of it at least

558
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,240
seems to be something that will always
be a part of the pen testers were terms

559
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:53,349
of getting its first of all day BC that
set was a miserable old version inside

560
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:58,640
anymore but its local human beings
aren't you

561
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:15,619
automation peace and social engineering
playground recently got a call that so

562
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:24,829
how do we make sure we do our own
quality control and make sure that we're

563
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:30,430
doing good assessments essentially if
you come across the scope you know

564
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:36,060
should be done in a week but they just
sold it as we doing it bc i three and

565
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,030
you know you may be able to get in a
week but say it may take you two weeks

566
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:44,369
how do we call to control how do we
prevent emails from driving the industry

567
00:49:44,369 --> 00:49:50,869
really quickly we have got a customer
who got in trouble recently because they

568
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:55,560
would not certified easy I he has the
same issue working paper the time is one

569
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,680
week really small go and we went to
certify 10 hits the board of directors

570
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,270
of the company they're at and they held
their ground and it took like six months

571
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,160
to resolve that they held their ground
all the way through and eventually the

572
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:12,470
company bought into it but couldn't find
anybody that's really really hard small

573
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:16,730
companies water resources networking
companies like you know good luck it is

574
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:17,970
really tough

575
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:21,660
I do think it's completely valid to
write in your report

576
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,040
limitations that are placed on you
including time-based limitations while

577
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,500
you're doing the test I mean your job is
to properly as best you can in the

578
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,369
resources you given to represent the
risk that organization and partner at

579
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:43,450
risk is your name and you can tell that
the other thing to keep in mind it for

580
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:50,130
you you should care if it qualifies for
PCI three right it's not your

581
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:56,660
responsibility to ensure that they do
the right thing that point that's

582
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:01,200
assuming you fought that battle all the
way up to the point where you signed the

583
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,859
contract and in my opinion you probably
shouldn't sign that contract I'm on your

584
00:51:06,859 --> 00:51:13,359
team for this because I've been on the
other side and I had to have the same

585
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:20,840
conversation and and and releasing your
own accountability if you have any bit

586
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,630
of pride in what you do for a living is
weakened heart and you just end up not

587
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:30,830
doing it right you end up going through
the test and giving them a hundred hours

588
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:36,450
when you have forty on the books because
you actually have pride in your work and

589
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:48,300
it's a hard thing to get a piece of
advice on if you push back I found that

590
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,580
the vast majority of our customers and I
think they were extremely lucky because

591
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,830
of security we clean all the things we
do in our customers know kind of getting

592
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:56,290
in

593
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:00,730
into before we actually do it if you
pushed back and it goes to the customer

594
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:05,000
I found nine times out of ten the
customer will come back and say I want

595
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,609
this done right and they will give you
that the additional time to do it you

596
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:12,440
just have to push back and if they
continue to push you know that's a

597
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:20,040
document it and move on or you
absolutely should you absolutely should

598
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,589
say that's not enough I'm sorry

599
00:52:23,589 --> 00:52:29,859
I know please don't do that toner but so
what i'm saying is you should push back

600
00:52:29,859 --> 00:52:35,019
you should say that's not enough and if
they don't come back and say okay we'll

601
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,079
give you more time

602
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:54,940
walk away your right if you do get into
the contract but I will tell you all the

603
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:21,019
time now and take your money and now
it's on the table isn't it does get to a

604
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:26,799
point and I know that a lot of you guys
are working for us all joking aside the

605
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:30,099
people that want to do quality work
companies that are up here we would take

606
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:33,489
every single one of you we could just
take your guns do the best you possibly

607
00:53:33,489 --> 00:53:39,650
can and look for an exit just just know
that we know that it's a problem and

608
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,190
constantly be looking for another
company that's the only thing I can

609
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:47,430
recommend

610
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:55,050
when newt room from possibly the oldest
person on this panel is is that this has

611
00:53:55,050 --> 00:54:02,240
happened before I was in the first batch
of USA's ever sorry any way for any of

612
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:07,520
you by the way who are my victims just
there I've gotten phone calls because I

613
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,839
would leave my real phone number in the
database would pop and I believe I'd

614
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:18,859
leave my username as I didn't know it
but it was to you

615
00:54:18,859 --> 00:54:25,270
herschel Chris stops you find herschel
christophe ski in any of your engagement

616
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:34,160
that might have been me with a 415 area
code you know you're right you were

617
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:34,650
young

618
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:42,319
no but the point is this happen before
the commoditization and you know the the

619
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:48,960
desire to get commodity type hun task
force under scoped underpaid all of that

620
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,829
stuff and the market will eventually
keep correcting itself and this is what

621
00:54:52,829 --> 00:54:57,910
they're all telling you and I can tell
you from that ancient time period of you

622
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:03,390
know ten or more years ago that this is
this is absolutely something that will

623
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:07,809
continue so do find other opportunities
at places where you feel like your

624
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:22,480
skills are being applied the way that
you want them to grow and show so so

625
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,200
we've noticed lately that breaches and
stuff

626
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,720
the Tigers are staying in the network's
longer they're sitting there and they're

627
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,630
watching and they're waiting and they're
slowly actual trading stock trading

628
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:38,290
persistent do you think that automation
tools soon be able to do that we're

629
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:42,930
talking on the human animations and
claimed that like that something that

630
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:47,609
it's an artist and human sitting there
watching and waiting and knowing how the

631
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:52,329
blue team's reacting and absolutely look
at the current trend to Penn decibels

632
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:55,730
out there and look at things like public
stuff we could always go look at the

633
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:59,960
stuff that iraq was doing double strike
three openly talk about competitors but

634
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,260
basically look at the source and
commercial space efforts working towards

635
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,960
those goals a building persistent
testing frameworks both commercial so

636
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,329
that's where the trends are going today
what do you think about security

637
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:13,280
products that have massive massive
security exposures in them that are

638
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:22,510
supposed to protect the network here on
your web server has roots alright I

639
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:23,690
don't know what you're talking about

640
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:33,270
all security software secure software
title when are we supposed to have like

641
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:37,500
you know like security practices that we
follow a security people writing secure

642
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,740
code like I mean are we supposed to like
hey you're probably shouldn't have

643
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:44,050
crappy code getting introduced in
customizing supposed to protect our

644
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:49,040
environment we should be running our web
servers as routes we shouldn't be in

645
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:57,030
1985 schools golden extinguish their
mother told all of us do as I say not as

646
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:02,799
I do and don't we all have to follow
that constantly yes sure I don't have a

647
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:09,630
pass from my phone but like I teach you
how to secure enterprise Saturday adding

648
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:29,150
display models were meditating on the
inside as I get an idea about but this

649
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:32,230
is the last topic of the days I think
it's really important route running out

650
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:35,819
of time but I mean where have bug
money's gone inside oh and by the way

651
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:41,140
our bug bounties impending computing
some people are trying to make them

652
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:46,609
compete but in fact you you can't
actually just operate with pure about

653
00:57:46,609 --> 00:57:52,720
bounties learn I save it from a company
that does but danny's yeah and the fact

654
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:59,369
of the matter is like the you always
need these inventors no ideally get

655
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:03,500
great Penn testers but you always need
these inventors and you're not

656
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:07,010
necessarily going to expose the same
kinds of transparency you're not gonna

657
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:12,450
do not necessarily gonna do white box
but bounties on unreleased code you're

658
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:17,150
not necessarily going to have people who
are going to be you know file format

659
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,950
aware you know for your part series and
all that stuff and a bug bounties

660
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:27,420
situation so it is that he meant a shin
and potentially some commoditization of

661
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:32,990
finding 0 days in your own applications
and whatnot for which there aren't a lot

662
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:39,000
of guys but absolutely you will you will
still need testing always I would say

663
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,829
from a bug bite me sign the ability to
detect and have folks that focus on your

664
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:48,950
code identify causes a massive asset to
our industry and I mean my pen testing

665
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:53,609
perspective it's completely different
goals and now we're looking for ways in

666
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:57,520
an adversary me go and attacking
compromise and from there cause damage

667
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,589
the organization whereas you were
looking for

668
00:58:59,589 --> 00:59:03,299
defects and applications defects in
different environments in the areas that

669
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:06,970
go in track and fix complete different
goals but something that's to the same

670
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,920
goal making sure that security done in a
good way so I completely agree about

671
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,770
those as well

672
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:17,339
yes yes yes thank everybody for coming
to the panel is given a round of

673
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:18,860
applause for everybody here

674
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,480
and daycare for the audience
participation the questions it was

675
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:29,110
wonderful talking about it's really
weird but no appreciate every coming out

676
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:37,310
here on this week on lunch break

677
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:41,840
breaking news rooms down into individual
rooms of this track to track wanna be

678
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,050
there at rectory be there is a lot of
other tracks from the place to get

679
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:48,990
familiar opening up the fender bender
areas on the lockpick village is all

680
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,950
that stuff now going so well
