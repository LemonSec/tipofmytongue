1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,040
so I'm a senior security consultant
rapid seven a lead enterprise

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,600
deployments team and I specialize in
building sustainable vulnerability

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,330
management program and that was what I
was going to tell you but the thought of

4
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,220
that makes me want it in my eyes so
instead I think it will just have a

5
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:35,290
story time where sounds better so once
upon a time I was working for a little

6
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:40,809
startup and other kind of incentive they
decided that they would take everyone

7
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:45,550
camping and we were going out we're in
Washington state so they figured oh

8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,469
we'll go out to this look at Mount
Rainier we reserve the entire camp

9
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:55,340
ground and it was gonna be a great you
know team building experience and when

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,730
we get there we go to set up our camp
and we see the $5 and they said caution

11
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:09,350
barren area has been kind of scary
really like theirs but you know will be

12
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,439
careful we're not gonna go wandering off
the trails and will be sharper stuff

13
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,880
away so I think we're aware that there
is a bear I don't see any bear poop

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:27,220
anywhere they were good so we set up our
campsite and it seemed pretty secure I

15
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,939
mean we had our we had our tent we were
doing s'mores around the fire or food

16
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,270
was was nice and safe and our coolers
and we had our our clothes from the

17
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,310
hiking hanging up there and put all of
our trash in the trash then so whether

18
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,869
you're worried for a good shape you know
what our food dry goods and are tense up

19
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,290
and everything's good right

20
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,590
so we go we pack up and we put
everything away safely and we go to bed

21
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,950
and I wake up in the morning you know
dawn is just breaking and I hear these

22
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:10,500
incredible shrieks like screams horrific
pain and I open my eyes and I could hold

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,040
my hand and there is this bear rampaging
through a campground

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,460
he isn't and even garbage cans I'm
freaking out everyone is even there's

25
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,230
like just thought even members like
hanging out all of the players I trip

26
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:36,240
over someone's leg I mean it was really
scary and with the war was no one really

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,120
told us there's can get into tents and
into trash can and so we didn't really

28
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:51,570
understand that bears in area meant that
you need to put your food away now this

29
00:02:51,570 --> 00:03:00,030
would have been a lot more useful this
food and trash and snowy closed and all

30
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,850
our food that we had out for the s'mores
and they can open cool others who knew

31
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:11,010
that would have been a much more useful
message this also would have been a much

32
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,120
more useful message it says that you
can't just put your food in your tender

33
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,700
intercooler the Bears opened that you
need to put your food in a camper that's

34
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,080
a hard thing a camper or in a bear safe
container or even suspended from a tree

35
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,640
at least 10 feet and 4 feet up those
would have been actionable messages

36
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,459
instead I found myself crawling in pain
even with puncture wounds from this bear

37
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:46,190
trying to get to the camp Ranger to find
a new company and that's why we're at

38
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:52,750
seven now so I was told that I actually
need to tell you that's not a true story

39
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,820
because he believed me I guess I'm
really passionate about bears the true

40
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,690
story if you want to hear it I was
hungover 1

41
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,340
morning and trying to explain to my
friend from louisiana why he needed to

42
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,090
put his food not in the tent in this
caller and all I could stand out was

43
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:15,540
because of bears but it turns out this
is actually a really good allegory for

44
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,610
vulnerability management today I've seen
a lot of vulnerability management

45
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:26,500
programs that equate to scan all the
things I think this was probably an

46
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,690
article in diesel magazine at some point
because I go to so many organizations

47
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:38,780
every day and he's leadership teams are
really on board with me to scan 100% of

48
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,250
the things no one can tell you what
they're doing he said data but they are

49
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:51,060
gathering that data mining all of the
organizations have absolutely no idea

50
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,770
what to do with the data they're
collecting with vulnerability scan in

51
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,280
reality this should be an iterative
cycle this cycle starts with discovery

52
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,090
discovery is great we know how to do
that basically this is what we get out

53
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,730
and we can all the things to us can all
the things we're going to start with

54
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:17,010
scanning by network range or by using
hooks into our DHCP DNS virtual

55
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,560
environment so on we pretty much got
that covered we know how to find the

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,400
things the next up is prioritizing RSS
no nod your head if you have a

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,790
vulnerability or not the classification
system I saw three people not what I

58
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:41,400
expected so having classification system
is really essential to being able to

59
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,310
prioritize your vulnerabilities and to
be able to relate to those

60
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,669
vulnerabilities in a way that he meeting
fall and I'll come back to that but

61
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:55,860
that's a whole nother chop from there we
assess things this is still part of

62
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,669
scanning the things those things that
you found them find out what Boehner

63
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,340
dodi's they have pretty sure we've got
that covered this is where we start to

64
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,200
fall apart in to report

65
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,050
most organizations that I see have two
reports one of those reports goes to

66
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,360
leadership and it says this is how many
vulnerabilities we found that some

67
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,430
heating this number and the second
report that I see goes out to all of the

68
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,430
ITT and it says these are all of the
vulnerabilities on your system has

69
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,290
absolutely no meaning they have no idea
what to do with it it's a large report

70
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:40,260
half of these are for Unix and Windows
that men not really I can't do it if not

71
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,950
meaningful to me individually so I don't
know what to do with it and you'll see

72
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,390
the next step is remediate we're not
getting to remediate because we don't

73
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,430
have a freemen message over doing is
screaming up and down the halls you have

74
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:02,350
bears ok I get it bears whatever just
tell me what I need to do in a

75
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,060
meaningful message I'm gonna tell you if
you go out and buy somewhere safe

76
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,300
containers and you go out and buy some
letters and you go out and buy some rope

77
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,490
now we're going to put all of the food
into the bear safe container and we

78
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,690
climb up the ladder and we're gonna tied
to a tree and we're stringent across

79
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,200
that will be better but we don't tell
people that we just say go fix these

80
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,660
days and so we can onto this verify
portion and this is where the process

81
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,990
becomes interactive but we're not
actually terrifying to think if we

82
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,760
haven't done anything because the whole
process just fell apart so we get in to

83
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,490
verify me scandal the things again and
we say nothing changed I don't

84
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:53,410
understand because I message was not
smart we need to be there smart simple

85
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:59,740
measurable actionable repeatable and
targeted this is how we need to request

86
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,810
or organizations in order to drive
remediation and actually find success in

87
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,220
our vulnerability management program for
not managing other abilities we have a

88
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,840
vulnerability identification problem

89
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:30,979
we're identifying them just fine we just
don't get a lot of 66 CBE 20150 456 does

90
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:36,849
your admin know what that means does
your admin care about what cattle feeds

91
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:41,599
all of our admins really want to care
about security we want them to care

92
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,920
about security they don't have time to
care about security and their bosses not

93
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
giving them time to care about security
all we can do is boil it down to the

94
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,880
most simple message possible patch Adobe
chose freakin hatchet don't tell me what

95
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,860
the vulnerability is just tell me what
to do what you want me to do I want to

96
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,120
care don't have time to care

97
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,320
keep it simple stupid we also need to
understand audiences as I mentioned we

98
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,589
usually have one report going to our
executives one report went to RIT

99
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:21,410
administrators there's a lot going on in
between there are a lot of different

100
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:28,180
messages and we need to know how to
frame those messages those messages need

101
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:42,740
to be measurable we have three metrics
insecurity we haven't been owned yet

102
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,399
that we're aware of people

103
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,130
security is the cost of all we do is
spend a lot of money and we can't prove

104
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,540
demonstrable success

105
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,490
the only thing that we can prove a
negative that we have not been

106
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,970
compromised as far as we're aware how do
we show that we are actually doing our

107
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:08,220
job how do we show that we are making
progress I can tell you this no one

108
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,920
cares about how many vulnerabilities are
in each category if you're sending a

109
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:20,580
report out we have eleven thousand four
hundred and eighty-six critical and 6942

110
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,850
moderate that is not meeting Paul what
happens when you go to Black History

111
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:35,250
Month a week before you're trying to
pack up his number one holdout so they

112
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,080
can make the most of their name and you
have this huge

113
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,670
in your abilities every month of August
every year

114
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,209
well that's good to hear numbers go up
which is why they're not meaningful it

115
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:51,000
hasn't been anyone not doing their job
it just means that you're reporting on

116
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,640
the wrong thing we need to look at me
stop former ability age by criticality

117
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,810
how old are the critical vulnerabilities
in my own but how old are the severe

118
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,770
vulnerabilities in my environment is my
policy says that I need a pot critical

119
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,850
vulnerabilities within 30 days which is
pretty reasonable for most organizations

120
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,970
because you don't actually have to
outrun the bear you just about ready for

121
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,899
Glenelg if I have to put my critical
vulnerabilities in 30 days when I want

122
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,100
to report on how people are doing
against that metric the age of

123
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,680
vulnerabilities by criticality perfect
metrics demonstrate that we also want to

124
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,899
know how many or new how many are old
and how many are so they break that down

125
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,480
again by criticality when I can show you
sure there was all of these

126
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,820
vulnerabilities that were just released
that we haven't patched yet but we did

127
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,880
watch all these other things great
nitric

128
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:56,020
big wins if we can look at both the
criticality of a vulnerability and in

129
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,890
tandem with dot the criticality of an
asset and wait that and determine what

130
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:07,000
the top time-warner abilities are in our
environment based on both criticality of

131
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,940
anonymity and criticality of the
opposite we can say if you r immediate

132
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,200
these ten things that you're gonna make
a huge dent in your own abilities I

133
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:27,930
guarantee you a job of Adobe Flash don't
understand what are you also long-term

134
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,200
risk trends we're not looking at a point
in time when ability scanning is the

135
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,740
point in time our success is not so long
term trends if we're looking at a boner

136
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:44,220
ability score a risk or that is weighted
by both the criticality of the asset and

137
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,720
the severity of the vulnerability now we
have a demonstrable number that we can

138
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,820
say yes this might spike up for a moment
at the beginning of August but overall

139
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,110
we r remediating more than is being
discovered and we're making progress

140
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,250
the number is dropping over time in
conjunction with the other metrics that

141
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,280
is mentioned these are great numbers
they're not super meaningful on their

142
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,270
own but together they're going to say
I'm doing something I'm fixing something

143
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,350
I know it feels like we're just hamster
wheel running and running and running

144
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,040
and as soon as we were meeting her
bilities me or come out but with these

145
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,780
metrics we can actually demonstrate that
we are succeeding and we stopped being a

146
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:31,900
cost under and we start being a valuable
asset to our organization

147
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,510
this is where we really struggle the AE

148
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:43,010
marked actionable we need to have
actionable results what do you expect me

149
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:49,100
to do with it what do I have to do to
make this immediate actionable steps

150
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,270
lead to remediation we also want to make
sure that those actionable results are

151
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:58,470
distributed appropriate to job function
the Windows administrator doesn't care

152
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,410
about you to her bilities

153
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,120
the unique couldn't care less about I
asked her abilities

154
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,110
why are you sending out one giant report
with all vulnerabilities they don't

155
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,690
understand that partying it up by funk
shun makes it more actionable also

156
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:20,110
keeping it simple yes we can have more
detail on request if you want more

157
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,870
information about the individual homer
abilities that your resulting that is

158
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,519
awesome I really hope that all of my
administrators get to that point most of

159
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,569
them aren't there today they don't have
the resources they just want to know

160
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:36,709
what they need to do so for each job
function you need to tell them

161
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,660
specifically what you need to do but
also we need to make sure that they

162
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,300
understand that we are here to help them
we're not going to just drop it on their

163
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,360
plate and run we're actually going to
walk them through the remediation

164
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,230
process we will help them understand the
steps they need to take her immediate we

165
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,910
will help them develop competition
controls your administrators are subject

166
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,220
matter experts expert on their platform
your administrators know their system

167
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,089
more than anyone else in your
organization if you can work with them

168
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,709
explain to them how these
vulnerabilities are compromised they

169
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:16,480
will come up with creative ways to get
around it so we provide those details on

170
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,699
on request but if all they need is what
you need to do about it we can provide

171
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:30,699
that to finally we want to make sure
that our message is targeted now I

172
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:35,089
mentioned before we have two reports one
for these a coupon for the admins those

173
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:43,110
are not all the reports and the reason
is job sorry if I

174
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,950
I had a dollar for every time someone
said we can't pop job because it breaks

175
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:53,899
the app I would be living on a private
island in the Caribbean cannot be a

176
00:15:53,899 --> 00:16:01,130
media we have pots Java because it
breaks the out if I'm only sending a

177
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,660
message to my executive team saying
here's a high-level information and a

178
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,800
message to the administrators say here's
our low-level information I am missing

179
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,089
the people who are actually responsible
for the security of the system

180
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:18,690
your business owners don't know squat
about security and I'm trying to censor

181
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:24,800
your business owners only understand
that they have an ethical responsibility

182
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,490
to protect that data that they have a
financial responsibility to protect that

183
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,440
data and in some cases of regulatory
compliance they have a legal obligation

184
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,899
to protect that data your business
owners do not want to go to jail for

185
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:47,829
socks violation they really do not want
to have the DHS that governs acceptable

186
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:53,190
use they do not want to be asked for
that money back they don't have your

187
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,640
business owners don't understand
vulnerabilities with a understand is

188
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,890
risk presenting a targeted message to
them in a way that says this is the risk

189
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:06,709
of this presents feel they can now make
an informed decision on that were bility

190
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:12,910
we see a lot of exceptions because of
the lack of targeted messages those

191
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,110
targeted messages are what get this
possum exception exception says that

192
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,630
this is an acceptable risk on behalf of
the organization I don't make enough

193
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,669
money to make that decision

194
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:27,110
most of you probably don't make enough
money to make that decision either we

195
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,120
have to bring that decision to the
people who do make enough money to make

196
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,760
that decision they don't understand what
availability is which represent a

197
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,890
targeted messages with an actionable
response saying this is the risk is a

198
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,770
quantifiable rest of this is presenting
to our organization if you don't have

199
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,790
this fixed because of those business
owners the ones that are left out in the

200
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:52,030
middle that can actually drive that
remediation for the case of job does

201
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,970
business owners either need to go to the
development team

202
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,880
it's an internal app or to their vendors

203
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,460
those contracts see what else we have
and determine what response we can

204
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,370
legally make that will push our vendor
or push our internal team what resources

205
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,840
we can allocate to get this fixed in the
application and our job doesn't end

206
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,100
there once they have made that decision
what they've said that this is not an

207
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,470
acceptable risk on behalf of our
organization and we're going to go back

208
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,950
to our vendor or going to go to the
development team they get that fixed we

209
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,570
create an exception for like three
months or six months and when that time

210
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:40,590
that we say hey you were getting us if
we're gonna do we keep bringing it back

211
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,500
up we keep bubbling at all so that they
get the ultimate issue fixed as soon as

212
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,429
that happens our job kicks back in we
now have to go to the server

213
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,320
administrators and say all right up
talking to rate you can now test this in

214
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,720
conjunction with the development team
and when that's done we go back to the

215
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,240
desktop team we said ok great shops not
gonna break your users can be on a more

216
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,340
current version of Java everything's
integrate this is a lot of moving parts

217
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,690
are a lot of instruments in this
orchestra and where the conductors we

218
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:16,059
need to be subject matter expert on
everything old times you don't have to

219
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:19,929
get deep you can always use Google to
find out what the actual vulnerability

220
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:25,130
is what you need to understand enough
about every technology organization to

221
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:31,040
orchestrate this effort and make sixty
targeted messages

222
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,270
the Bears are at your gate they are
literally standing there this was

223
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:41,070
actually taken just down the road from
my house turns out bird feeders are also

224
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:48,570
bears leaders in the target breach I
read a lot of news articles that were

225
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:54,110
following up on that and one of the
articles I read stuck out my mind it was

226
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,940
an interview with someone in operational
security someone was watching their

227
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,770
ideas was reading their vulnerability
scanning results and he said yeah you

228
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,460
know i've been trying to get the the
leaders to get an assessment for like

229
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:13,630
the last two months and no one has
responded to that actually made an

230
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,030
assessment are you telling me that this
was not something that you could have

231
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:24,440
seen any of the tools that your place or
was it more than he didn't know how to

232
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,640
phrase that message the right people you
know how to make an actionable statement

233
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,410
smart statement to the appropriate
parties that could get that resolved

234
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,390
instead he passed the buck and said if
you have a third party coming here and

235
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,240
tell you this you're going to respect
their opinion more than mine and so then

236
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,760
it will get fixed we can't you possible
book we all know we have to make our

237
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,440
messages more understandable for both
our leadership and our administrators

238
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,450
and coordinate the effort instead of
just dropping this on their plate stop

239
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,930
screaming about bears when you are
dropping off giant list of

240
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:09,860
vulnerabilities all you're doing is
running up and down the halls going yeah

241
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:17,740
we all have been don't have to outrun
the Bears are at your day what are you

242
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,850
doing about it

243
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,550
and any questions
