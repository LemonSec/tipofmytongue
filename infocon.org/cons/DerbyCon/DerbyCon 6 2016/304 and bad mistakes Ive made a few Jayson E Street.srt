1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,150
here I just don't adult very well ain't
that the truth brother i'm telling you

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:20,820
see with Jay was really isn't personal
that was just a joke

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,130
where is it was closed when we're good
we're good

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:40,500
no need to panic when y'all were
panicking i was is they all told anyone

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
okay here we go

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,328
ipad is break with him i thought okay we
go

7
00:00:51,329 --> 00:01:11,850
I can't even see you'll see that see as
advertised not even playing around like

8
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:25,229
so now this is a talk that was long
overdue I think because it's about me

9
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,299
bailing on everybody goes to security
conferences and you see these awesome

10
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,640
amazing talks of all these wonderful
exploits and stuff like that's all you

11
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,759
see and my talk last year was breaking
bad words all look I broke into this

12
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,450
place in the government it was like the
highlight reel how awesome the stuff

13
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,210
that I do is write with Latino some
stuff that I was hoping that you would

14
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,289
take back and learn from how true is
that

15
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,439
why isn't everybody talked about how
they failed and how other people cannot

16
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,240
make those kind of mistakes

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,020
why are people learning how you know
just go in and say hey you know I messed

18
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,780
up this is how I screwed up it's like
don't do this

19
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,780
it's always like look how amazing this
is one try seriously you just happened

20
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,150
so this is a talk on failure

21
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,050
this is not the cool failure kind of
talk where it's like oh yeah I

22
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,110
accidentally left an orange out and
invented penicillin yeah it's no it's

23
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,410
not like that it's like you know it's
not the kind of talk where it's like

24
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,500
well i tried a thousand times and stuff
you know and I invented the lightbulb

25
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,660
laughter I still in destroyed testimony

26
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,069
no it's not that kind of talk to either
this is literally a talk about how I've

27
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,329
screwed up and how I've done really
stupid embarrassing things that I get to

28
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,390
share with you guys but it's gonna be
between us right no one else is gonna

29
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,458
see this okay it's fine

30
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,519
so that's one of the main things that
you need to know about me is that I'm an

31
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,170
expert at failing i mean i do it really
well I mean it was a job I probably fair

32
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,238
like it but it's not so I'm doing good

33
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,560
it's like I've made mistakes it's like I
have no college education it's like I've

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,910
never had someone tell me how to do
things right so I've usually learned on

35
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,540
my own trying to figure out how to do
things and I've made lots of mistakes

36
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,319
doing it so I thought why not have a
talk on that and so what we're going to

37
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,328
discuss during this this talk are three
different lessons from three different

38
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:28,049
parts of our life you know it's like a
two to fills that i did is red team to

39
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:30,870
fails i get is a blue team and to fails

40
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,069
I've done in the community and these are
like you know how I totally screwed

41
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:40,170
things up so let's start off I'm I'm old
so people may not remember this guy

42
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,630
Barney Fife from you know may vary and
it brings this is the perfect way to

43
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,760
start this talk because back in two
thousand i started information security

44
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,899
be prior to that I was physical security
and law enforcement it's like I always

45
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,500
have an adversary I mean I learned that
you know

46
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,750
I'm dealing with suspects I'm dealing
with people that are suspicious i came

47
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,300
and talked and interacting with every
person on their worst possible day every

48
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,209
single my life on the job was chillin
with someone on the worst possible day

49
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,360
of their life either something horrible
just happened to them and so I was there

50
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,450
or something horrible is about to happen
to them because i was there it's like it

51
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,099
was not a good place

52
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,860
it's like I didn't really like it that
much and you know who wants to get shot

53
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,640
at that sucks so I stopped doing that
and it's like I got into iit and back in

54
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:48,750
two thousand i found out that you could
do computers and security and no one

55
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,130
shoots at you

56
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,340
course now i'm doing red you know pin
testing and physical stuff some people

57
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,919
still have a possible shooting me now
but you know it still doesn't matter

58
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,450
it's like it's still fun i'm still
having fun doing security with computers

59
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:07,380
but I sucked really bad at it when i
first started because I treated my users

60
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,940
and my employees like I was on the beat
you know it's like you know everybody

61
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,460
was suspicious everybody was someone
that was probably gonna do something bad

62
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,060
on the network someone was surfing
somewhere plugging in something wrong

63
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,340
and I was the guy to stop them

64
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:27,900
you know I'm like how's it going so
download anything suspicious lately I

65
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,010
didn't think so

66
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,940
you know it was that it was horrible
it's like I literally did one of the

67
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,100
things that i did was i used to do badge
inspection company policies that

68
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,860
everybody had to have their bags if you
don't have your badge and get a

69
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,640
visitor's badge so I walked by the owner
of the company's uh the the bank i want

70
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,640
by his office one monday and he was like
still looking for his his back was to me

71
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,060
to the door and he was looking on the
computer a what's going on he's a

72
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,790
coastline is fine and I'm like spicy
scent had a good weekend

73
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,180
oh yeah everything's going great and
stuff you notice i guess it was really

74
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,180
good he's still looking like this
workout and I'm like

75
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:14,489
forgot your badge did you and shoulders
went down

76
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:19,948
yes come with me and I took the owner of
the company to the receptionist's desk

77
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,269
and he wore visitor's badge the whole
entire day because that was company

78
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:27,269
policy was that cool on me

79
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:34,379
no that wasn't cool on me that was cool
on him because he bought into the

80
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:40,739
security policy and he enforced it I
wasn't a whole I was a jerk

81
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:47,069
it's like this picture is there's a
poster that you can buy a metal post

82
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:51,629
that you can buy of this that has on it
says five security agency that was a

83
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:57,119
gift to me from the CEO and the
management team one day for a birthday

84
00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:01,349
stuff and I am so really bad at human
interaction

85
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:04,378
it literally took me years to figure out
that

86
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:07,379
oh they meant it as an insult

87
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:13,558
they were calling me that guy i
literally framed it in my office because

88
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,259
they look at nice to give me one and
stuff you know

89
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,509
no they were telling me we think you're
an idiot Jason and we don't respect you

90
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,519
because you're stupid

91
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:31,319
how good did i do it securing that
environment not very well it's like I

92
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,219
didn't really do it we were secure we
didn't you know nothing brings with

93
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,589
companies actually gone so it doesn't
matter what they actually went under it

94
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:44,249
was . com things didn't happen well it's
like so it didn't i didn't do anything

95
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:48,779
and I didn't value add to my users
because all I taught them was to try to

96
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:55,889
avoid me it's like do things on the
policy so you don't have to deal with

97
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,339
that you know we're doing stuff you know
it comes around with the RTG cup it like

98
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,479
that's not cool

99
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,269
so he's an idiot just leave him alone as
I can just do what you're supposed to do

100
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:05,189
and he won't come over and give you a
hard time

101
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:08,399
that's not how you do good security

102
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,839
it's like we have to start understanding
that we got engaged our users and treat

103
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,729
them as part of the security process we
need to let them know that were there

104
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,760
working for them to help them keep them
employed

105
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,349
you have to cultivate relationships not
animosity

106
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,000
it's like and I didn't do that at first
it's like it took me awhile to get that

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,350
going I it takes me a long time to learn
things the hard way because a foster an

108
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,830
image of being part of the solution and
you're not looking out for a problem

109
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,780
it's not everyone that you're chillin
with the suspect there and ask that the

110
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,319
their part of your security team and if
your users don't think they're part of

111
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,690
your security team then I'm not the only
one failing this room it's like you have

112
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,620
to understand that they are part of the
security team and empower employees to

113
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,730
get involved with what you did you have
to show them that what they do and how

114
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:12,390
they help you matters literally 100 i
just got ice by day with a warm diet

115
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,520
coke

116
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,720
and here i am thinking that I was
unprofessional and not adulting thanks

117
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,330
but no you gotta give you going to give
me a hug you're gonna give me a diet

118
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,660
coke

119
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:55,319
I mean seriously so that's fantastic i
like to spew yeah it's a smirnoff

120
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,090
bottles this big the Kings is big i
don't okay different

121
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,350
well we're gonna leave it at that then
there you go

122
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,500
I don't be a quitter

123
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,970
thank you four copies even hear the burg
know everybody appreciates that

124
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,160
ok so you have to get them involved in
the process and one of the key things

125
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,439
that you do that is by letting giving
them ways to be involved i have a user

126
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,380
at one of jobs that have worked where he
got spam phishing attacks and spam

127
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:54,880
emails i was like no way we can forgo
security think they're suspicious or new

128
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
and cutting edges i want you for them to
us and we'll take a look at it

129
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,760
I did not know what I was getting into I
have a spam filter rule for the spam

130
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,910
filter rule guy sending me spam

131
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,209
ok this guy is so helpful

132
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,980
he literally sends me spam from his home
account not the work account his home

133
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,520
account

134
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,689

while I part of the information security

like yeah this is what they do it's like

143
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,060
so that's a good thing that gets them
involved in it that makes them invested

144
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,920
in it every member from the CEO to the
mailroom and in between it's part of

145
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,520
your information security program and
they need to be aware of that and know

146
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:07,540
that now the next one this is literally
one of the most embarrassing fails I've

147
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,319
ever done

148
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,570
I mean it was like really I i I've lost
very easily for the slightest thing it's

149
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,390
like which is weird because you know
because i do the stuff you know for

150
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,350
living but it's like this was
embarrassing

151
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,980
my boss wasn't at work one day which he
learned to live to regret and I the one

152
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,340
monitoring i'm always wanted to firewall
logs you know it's like I watched the

153
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,280
firewall logs like a soap opera you know
I'm constantly watching it's like

154
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,800
there's a monitor on my desk and it's
like you know

155
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,519
I'm waiting for the bad things to come
in and get me and I'm looking i noticed

156
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,610
one day that there was a telnet traffic
from inside our routers I mean it's

157
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,180
literally at that moment you know the
phone calls coming from inside the house

158
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,660
you know and i'm like walked up and I'm
freaking up out so what do i do i do

159
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,350
what any normal rational person no hits
that's I can't even finish that sentence

160
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,760
because you know that's not true

161
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,899
it's like a freaking break up out and
went over the networking guys like hey

162
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,720
guys like we got to track where the
traffic coming from i need you to tell

163
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,620
me do I treat the network guys ever nice
know their networking screw those guys

164
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,980
right i mean let's face it

165
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,589
let's be honest just a 2-second moment
here what did networking guys do they

166
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:27,640
want to make the network faster shutter
speed it up guys beat up gotta make sure

167
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,640
we could meet their metrics what
security guys gotta do

168
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,589
hold your horses slow down slow down we
got to put the package you know sort of

169
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,089
that rivalry

170
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,060
it's like and I was like and also
because they're evil but you know stills

171
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,510
I hey I got issues okay I've never said
i have it so I'm doing better with them

172
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:49,149
but I never really went to the
networking guys ever unless I need them

173
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:50,560
to do something for me

174
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,410
why would I I mean hey I wouldn't go
into the networking area unless I let my

175
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,770
boss know that I was gonna be in there
and if you and I wasn't helped by 30

176
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,189
minutes to call the black shoppers and
and I told him about my safe word was

177
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,540
you know it's like I mean that's how I
dealt with networking so I go in there

178
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,529
and network managers like yeah that is
strange that's really weird and like

179
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,800
that's all I need to hear really weird
and strange something's going on

180
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:22,390
incident we escalated it after talking
to the manager him saying that escalate

181
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,079
it

182
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,149
my boss is in here oh my boss reports
the gallo

183
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:34,600
well I got to talk to the next person in
charge so i go to the CIO my company and

184
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
tell them how we're having this issue
and has a possible breach inside our

185
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,269
network and I don't know how they got in
but it looks very suspicious it looks

186
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:41,180
bad

187
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,040
and you know it's something we need to
deal with so we started the incident we

188
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,920
go back over the network part they're
looking around we're trying to do some

189
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,650
searches trying to figure out where
these IP addresses or they're coming

190
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,800
totally internal they're coming they're
hitting routers and I'm like they're

191
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,829
hitting routers I'm thinking cisco by
warner building you know it's like

192
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,620
before you know they screwed up and left
all their stuff out

193
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:07,790
I'm thinking oh my gosh this is really
bad uh 15 minutes in a guy raises hand

194
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,060
with the network guys guys

195
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,369
what was that source IP address again
that we tell them it could that be the

196
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,460
telnet scan i'm running on all our
routers and stuff you know doing a

197
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:30,440
configuration check and I'm like mother
could you said that little sooner my CIS

198
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,570
looking at me like can you wait just a
little longer and online and i literally

199
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,400
it's like I lost so much credibility on
that because i didn't want to deal with

200
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,959
them and they were trolling me it's like
they got me good on that one

201
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,530
it's like that was my fault i made
several mistakes on that one but one of

202
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,810
the first things that I made the mistake
on was I never listen to him

203
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,810
I never tried to deal with them in a
pleasant manner

204
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,910
it's like it was just there there to do
the things that I need to get done .

205
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,060
that was wrong

206
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,050
you need to listen to your networking
networking team is also part of your

207
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,550
security department and your part of the
networking team you have things they're

208
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,560
both were all geeks right i mean they
may like Star Trek more than Star Wars

209
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,560
or you know it's like but everybody
loves Babylon 5 so you've got common

210
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,170
ground always and fireflies you know
amazing

211
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,400
so there you go you've got coming ground
to work with it find common ground and

212
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,660
let's face it once again they're geeks
they're broadcasting what they like my

213
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,410
action figures and other little things
and stickers and posters on their third

214
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:46,280
best as well so look at those try to
find something that you can meet with go

215
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,640
to lunch with them if you can some of
those guys like you know that you're

216
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,430
speeding up in and you just leave me
alone sorts of issues

217
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,370
ok amor

218
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:58,470
beyond it ok but you try to interact
with them trying to learn with them its

219
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,650
I try to make sure that they understand
that you're there to help them because

220
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,949
when the network is secure it one's more
stable

221
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,309
it's like when you helped make the
network run faster than they got a use

222
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:16,139
for you and then you can be friends show
them how that works

223
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,220
try to make sure that they're on your
side and never just go running bloody

224
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,949
murder when you see that elements can
that's the thing i learned that lesson I

225
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,420
don't you use that but you know i would
definitely try and you develop this

226
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:32,130
communication before the crisis don't do
it right when it's happening it's like

227
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,929
learning it before it's like and the
other thing is man search on all aspects

228
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:42,840
don't make assumptions because you know
you an option it's not gonna work out

229
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,590
well so it's like so make sure that
you're learning and you're not just

230
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:53,280
jumping to the critical thing of like
this is the worst case scenario so the

231
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,000
next part is my red team fail it's like
a and i use it slide because this is

232
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,309
what I used to think red team fails work
when i start CI let's put it understands

233
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,370
like I've never really think I've ever
done a proper red team

234
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,020
ok but when i started doing penetration
testing when i started doing the

235
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,790
offensive side of it i didn't know what
i was doing and I have very bad

236
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,020
self-esteem I very low poor image of
what i can do so I was like going to

237
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,280
others and see what they do and I'm
thinking well that's what I gotta do I

238
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,080
gotta go into the company go phone which
plan go you know it's like I've got to

239
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,470
be off offensive i gotta be like I've
got to go in there

240
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,210
I mean and just take a second look for
this quote I mean not just because the

241
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,300
fact is a convicted rapist and stuff you
know like having great this to my slides

242
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,860
unless i'm talking about privacy
advocacy or ipv6 but what does that

243
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:52,889
really make sense to you but that's what
you have to do that you have to deal

244
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,980
with your client and such an adversarial
way when did they become the enemy

245
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,119
they're you're client

246
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:07,849
you're there to help them make them more
secure and so one of the investigators

247
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:13,339
that I was on I was doing with this one
company and this guy using was a

248
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:17,448
networking guy just FYI i'm just saying
I'm not not accusing anybody anything

249
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:22,459
i'm just stating for the record he was a
network guy and he didn't like us so

250
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:26,929
much and he was making my life difficult
on this pin test

251
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:32,779
uh well one of our other guys he came
out and got the courage to the domain

252
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:39,049
adding controller and everybody's user
ID and the passwords they used for the

253
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,679
last two years you know it was it was a
good use a good gig I had nothing to do

254
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:49,939
with that he did that but the networking
guy had a favorite password and what he

255
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:55,189
liked to do with a certain word you just
put numbers on it at the end

256
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:58,549
no not password that would have been
amazing really just totally straight out

257
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:04,999
Jack them on that one knows even funnier
that so what we did was on a call with

258
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:11,209
his boss our boss and then the clients
boss's boss we're on his big conference

259
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:16,309
call and all the pin testers started
using that word and try to work it into

260
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:19,559
a sentence

261
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,649
it was creative on our part

262
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:29,908
some of it was just obviously yeah okay
it's like it was hilarious haven't

263
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:33,899
helped did that make you more secure

264
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,480
did that make him feel indebted to us
for the work that we did in the bindings

265
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,440
that we found no screws guys he learned
nothing from that except for that we

266
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,659
were jerks and he didn't want to work
with us

267
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:52,830
so any of the findings that we had that
would have helped secure his company or

268
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:59,220
lessened by the fact that he had to deal
with us giving him that information we

269
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,649
didn't do a good job

270
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:04,199
it's like that's the reason why i'm not
saying during their names because this

271
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,480
is on me it's like I didn't do a good
job for him it's like I was making it

272
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:17,009
adversarial i was making it something
that didn't need to be and so how did I

273
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,269
help

274
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:24,389
that's a problem it's like we need to
understand no matter how much damage we

275
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:30,090
do no matter how much stuff that we do
or uncover we're doing that to better

276
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:37,230
the security of the client we're not
there to find vulnerabilities were there

277
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:44,789
to help secure their company we do that
by finding vulnerabilities we find ways

278
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:50,850
and processes that can be improved but
it's not there to go and say hey I'm

279
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,850
here I'm your pen testing plan full what
we're doing . go

280
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,460
you know that's not what's going to
happen that's not going to increase your

281
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:07,019
return rate on your their investment so
I mean those and this is I mean you

282
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:10,289
gotta take it from a guy who literally
when he gets punched in the face too

283
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,499
much bite off a guy's here you know so I
mean let's talk about saying that but

284
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,730
this quote is actually halfway decent
because it tells you something very

285
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,539
important everybody who fights to you is
not your enemy and everybody that helps

286
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:28,320
you is not your friend you can be an
adversary and be there to help them with

287
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,240
it you can take that adversarial role in

288
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,470
help them with it it's like face the
fact that you're not part of the

289
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:41,230
solution and you are the problem give
them the value that they need by having

290
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:46,270
them to see what an actual attack would
be like and then helping them fix it

291
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,990
showing them where the vulnerabilities
are and what they can do to make it

292
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,700
better allies coming along unlikely
forms and unlikely places you know what

293
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,980
happened when I stopped doing this when
I stopped doing that adverse road

294
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,160
do you know what I got help

295
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:10,059
I literally got employee when I go in
into got engagement and look guys this

296
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:12,100
is not to make you look bad

297
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,530
I'm here to facilitate you getting the
things that you need to do your job when

298
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,950
I'm fine finding that you probably
already know about and I'm going to come

299
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,490
across things that maybe you don't know
about but what I'm going to do is I'm

300
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,120
going to be that voice to management to
help you get the things that you need to

301
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,110
better secure your company your
management may not be listening to you

302
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,909
the way they should but they brought me
in here to listen to me and I can help

303
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,960
me you be that advocate for you to get
the things to help better secure your

304
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,640
company because that's what you want and
that's what i want and i have literally

305
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,809
had clients go and say well that's
really cool eat another this other

306
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:52,570
server in this developed area so if you
know about people notice there's a

307
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,730
firewall rule but if you go past that on
this one port it's totally hoping we've

308
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,590
been saying that for years no one's
fixed it

309
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:07,840
that's the finding so that helps you
because you're actually helping them

310
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,419
it's like that's one of the key things
and also short-term satisfaction off

311
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:19,360
often leads to long-term headache it was
hilarious that conference call

312
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,100
I mean seriously I got some satisfaction
now that that guy was a total bad word

313
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,260
Edward another bad word for good measure
it was bad he was a he was really a not

314
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,890
nice person so I really enjoyed you know
trolling guess how many times we've got

315
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,440
asked back to do that contract

316
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,320
how many times they call us back

317
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,320
yeah goose egg

318
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,220
why would that we were a holes we were
jerks

319
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,149
I wouldn't want to deal with me back in
it i mean i have to do anything except

320
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:53,969
me back in but you know it's like
literally it's like going back now I

321
00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:00,360
wouldn't dealt with me back in so that's
the issue you have to make sure that

322
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,860
you're helping out your client and that
guess what they may actually stick your

323
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,090
clients and that's good free now uh
what's that supposed to be doing

324
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,080
business

325
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,110
yeah it's good for business

326
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:18,870
so this is a another one this is
actually this was the one of the best

327
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,799
felt because like that blue team one was
one of the worst bells i did this is

328
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,750
actually one of the best fails that I
did I learned something important during

329
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,840
engagement and what this was with a
client who had a very secure facility

330
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,668
and I need to get in the door and so I'm
in this one area and i'm waiting for the

331
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:42,120
client to go through and when they go
through this lady comes in to get into

332
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,320
the door not giving up behind her and
she looks at my badge and she takes a

333
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,439
sec a second to look at it and I don't
blame her

334
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,659
visitor's badge actually said Gregory D
Evans hoops the ink with my face going

335
00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:00,450
so i can understand where she would look
at that going that seems odd but what

336
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,250
did she do she let me in and so she went
to the right

337
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,090
I went to the left when the managers one
guy's office and I pwned him

338
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:16,889
yeah I want my only have to get right
once to win i go to the second machine

339
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:19,350
phoned good

340
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:25,649
Jamie I'm feeling you know awesome i go
out of the third machine out of the

341
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:30,870
third desk in the third cube and look
down the hallway and there's that lady

342
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,439
is she and I can tell by her body
language I can tell by your face when

343
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,149
she's talking to someone you can tell
that she's upset you can tell she knows

344
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:41,158
I she made a mistake

345
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:49,470
The Doors right there I can go out that
door and mother I want who touchdown i'm

346
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,740
getting ice cream

347
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:56,140
and then I thought to myself what if I
let her win

348
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:04,030
what if I keep going and see what she
does and give her the chance to make it

349
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,710
right

350
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:12,130
what happens then and that is the
engagement that I stopped doing a

351
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,990
reading pretend to try to do red team or
pentesting i only do security awareness

352
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:22,300
engagements now because on every
engagement that i do now i let the

353
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:29,800
client win at least once i give them a
win and so I walked past that late and I

354
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,330
was like hey how you doing

355
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,149
you know she didn't say hi back which I
thought was rather rude ok I'm trying to

356
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:34,960
help her out

357
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,660
okay that's a little rude I'm just
saying I'm not trying to cast aspersions

358
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,690
on the person but you know you're
supposed to be plucked what she was

359
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,130
already feel like maybe it was a problem

360
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,540
okay so yeah so I went to this other
office and I've been acting guess what I

361
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,480
didn't compromise and machine you can
still do my job I'm giving you a chance

362
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,920
right

363
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,140
less than a minute later this freaking
6-foot Air Force dude cums what are you

364
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,440
doing on it isn't my mother I regret
this decision is to you know it's like

365
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,100
I'm like what i did is like trying to
like what I got it I don't care what see

366
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,850
I'm gonna call who with me here for and
I'm like this is not going how I planned

367
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:12,550
to the kitchen there's like what they
call and they found out and they had a

368
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:19,360
win and now instead of having all these
bad things to look down at about how

369
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,169
they fail they have something to look up
to now their employees are saying hey

370
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,700
when you see someone doing something
like do what this person did and this is

371
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:36,010
what they did and this is how they did
it and that makes it real to them and

372
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,450
they start taking it to heart instead of
getting a report three months later

373
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,780
about all the things that happened to
some good guy that happened three months

374
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,160
ago that was bad and they need to go
through reorientation again and look at

375
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,140
the internet and click on a little web
seminar on how they need to combat

376
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,570
social engineering

377
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,629
it's like every engagement I go in now

378
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,990
I will go into that place and I will
destroy them to the best of my ability

379
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,350
and then I escape for two minutes

380
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,899
I'm literally this week or so ago it's
like I was actually I ducked into a

381
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,580
weave place and Beirut I was Iran have
the ability to quickly this lady was

382
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,550
coming up behind me and literally I was
going down the side building there's

383
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,149
like it was an alleyway and I'm like so
I ducked in the first open store thing

384
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:28,860
and it was like this we place for hair
and there's an easy-open couple they're

385
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,909
wonderful couple family with the little
girl and they invited me to lunch

386
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,300
I mean it was very hospitable people and
I'm like no not just need to check

387
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,659
something real quick and i was like i
was texting but I was escaping i was

388
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:45,750
making sure that they didn't catch me
but what I do after that I went back in

389
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,100
and I talked to every single person that
I compromised and I told them right in

390
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,820
there

391
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,649
what I was doing was bad why was bad and
how they needed to learn from it that

392
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:01,170
gave them what I call a teachable moment
that gave them that teachable moment of

393
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:05,640
what they need not do or do to better
keep people like me out

394
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,840
I mean sometimes I've had to work at it
I mean I was literally at this one bank

395
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,379
and i have been sitting there for like
20 minutes doing all kinds of nefarious

396
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,670
things and I have really bad HD so I was
getting really bored at this point i

397
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,850
mean i was sitting in the chairs like
come on please i'm a bad God and I

398
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,360
leaned over in this is the guy supposed
to this was I've already totally pwned

399
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,590
all these other people

400
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,139
this was supposed to be their win this
was supposed to be the one where they

401
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,750
actually won and caught me but no one
was catching me and I need to be caught

402
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,740
so I literally leaned over to the guy
and tap on the shoulder

403
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,480
so what's user ID and password for this
server that's actually doing all this

404
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,380
business right now for you guys because
I'd like a little swim server desk and

405
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,300
stuff you know underneath your desk
right there

406
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,040
so what's the username password for this
he tells me the user ID is the same as

407
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,330
the password which was this plane is the
name of the Machine seems legit yeah

408
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:05,269
so so I gonna do i do i log into that
mother okay and I shut it down

409
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:13,549
it's conducting business there I shut it
down i unplug it I start taking it out

410
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:19,370
and I'm thinking to myself maybe they'll
notice something's catch you know it so

411
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:25,459
like I get to the door I get to the
Gateway door and the guys like I should

412
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,990
question what that guys doing with our
server which is a good god I can't blame

413
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,250
him for that

414
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,210
so he literally comes up to me he's like
you do what are you doing and I

415
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,139
literally had to physically restrain
myself from the five things that could

416
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:41,269
have just immediately come out of my
mouth that would have made it single

417
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:42,769
change that he would let me go

418
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:46,039
okay because I'm trying to give him a
win so I literally as soon as he said

419
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:52,220
that I was like oh you got me i was a
bad guy i'm doing your good like you I'm

420
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,850
glad you gave me the user ID and
password reducing welcome to do with it

421
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,269
that was very smart that was like you I
wouldn't do that next time but you're

422
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:04,039
good to call me you I'm what's your name
we gonna put you in the report your

423
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,019
amazing way to go i just got yeah I'm
done you what you want

424
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,879
ok so sometimes you have to like help
them a little bit more than usual but

425
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,899
you've got to give them the win you got
to give them something to look up to

426
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:22,428
because then you put that name in the
report I never put report names of the

427
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:27,380
people who fail in the report never but
I make sure in bold the person you

428
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,460
caught me the person who did the right
thing is rewarded by at least by

429
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,799
recognition because that gives the other
co-workers something to look up to that

430
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,570
because it just remember we're gonna go
to number two servers don't respond to

431
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:46,340
attack with resentment you know I've
never seen the server go like that

432
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,490
wasn't very nice

433
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,280
well actually it was some of the blue
screens desk maybe that's what that

434
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,280
maybe that's what the problem is I don't
know but it's like you don't see that

435
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,960
people get that you've got to understand
that you're dealing with people even

436
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,070
when from the network layer and you're
all the way in one other part of the

437
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:06,340
world and then the other part of the
world there are still people responsible

438
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,750
for those services are responsible for
that network and you're trashing what

439
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,690
they do for a living

440
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:19,120
you have to remember that you may never
physically go to your customer site and

441
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,510
see what they're doing and try to figure
out how to work with what their their

442
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:27,910
network is but you're dealing with
people that's responsibilities to keep

443
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,670
that secure remember that

444
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,800
so give me a target wind doesn't
diminish your CAC I didn't look bad at

445
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:44,139
any of those attacks i still succeeded
but I still gave them the wind that's

446
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,080
Michael Allen giving me crap right now I
don't care what you think that's a

447
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,300
mistake that's I'm being trolled next
door

448
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,610
it's like so so when you look at a blue
team as a teammate and unnecessary both

449
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,719
win right

450
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,720
they started listening to what I had to
say they weren't just feeling negative

451
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:08,440
about it they felt good about it and so
therefore i want because I help the

452
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:14,918
client and I help the people in the
day-to-day business succeed even on the

453
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:20,138
branches that I totally destroyed and
they got know when whatsoever they still

454
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:23,440
got to hear about the other branches
that did good and want to be like that

455
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,639
and wanted to do that next time because
that's something that the management

456
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:31,300
didn't mind talking about so that helps
a lot

457
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:37,240
now the next to me felt this is really
interesting because I've been waiting

458
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:44,439
for derby con to do this one so i
started this talk on started getting

459
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,330
ready for it last year about failure

460
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:50,409
it's like and one of the key things that
it brought up to me and the reason why i

461
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:57,430
started building it is because you might
see my breaking bad talk it's like I

462
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,910
really think I feel like a badass on
some of those things you know it's like

463
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,210
look at me breaking into this

464
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:08,119
you know bank and it just a treasure
over here it's like a look i have broken

465
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,640
this place and you make it look how
awesome that stuff was how does that

466
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,960
help anybody

467
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,560
it's like that's me grand izing talk
about that stuff you know and I put some

468
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,940
information in there but I started
thinking about that and actually had

469
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,140
someone from one of the talks it's like
that was from one of the examples he

470
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,368
called me out on something it's like
because this is the part where we talk

471
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:37,700
about our community and how we actually
deal with each other and one of the

472
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:43,700
things that I failed on was credit when
I gave that talk

473
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:50,118
Breaking Bad how many times did I
mention that my koala and your nuke was

474
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,990
there helping me do research and recon
for that charity in Jamaica never i

475
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,740
never gave them props they were there
with me I was by myself doing all the

476
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,450
cool stuff you know getting in there but
I didn't do that alone when I've done

477
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,410
this stuff in Beirut little help set up
a web server against help with the beef

478
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,279
hook projects I couldn't do that the
beach server they said all that up i did

479
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,430
the fish I said that stuff out yet knee
but I didn't do it alone

480
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,980
it's like the state treasury it's likely
the reason why they're so pissed because

481
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,210
believe in angel from metrocard they
destroyed them from the network side of

482
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:31,460
it that's why i got called in a lot of
these things don't happen in a vacuum

483
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,830
and sometimes we try to ask for help
from other people and we think that

484
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,670
we're going to get that help from him
and that that's all we can do we just we

485
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,780
need it that's all we do and we don't
give credit to it it's like so it makes

486
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:52,910
me talk to people about one thing it's
getting wrong and being upset i have

487
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,910
people who don't like me in this
industry you don't like me they don't

488
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,359
have to like me it's like you know I
know my door when I know you find that

489
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,930
hard to believe but some people don't
like me and that

490
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,660
that no wonder i've literally told one
person is it look you know that bridge

491
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,560
we burned down

492
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,160
I think that's really good can we widen
the river maybe set it on fire I'm good

493
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,029
with that

494
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:19,490
that's good for me that works for me but
they don't want they haven't wrong to me

495
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:25,339
in this industry we need to be more
vocal when we get wrong

496
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,259
we need to get more vocal when someone
does something that's not right

497
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,840
it's like I got called out privately but
still I got called out and I was like

498
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,710
you know what you're right i got an
excuse i got an apology because that's

499
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,820
the way it should happen but you can't
be in this district and everything that

500
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,390
someone does you don't like or think
this upset is being wrong

501
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,299
no you're being upset because they're
jerks it's like that happens if i can

502
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,960
it's sort of like segues into something
else that we're gonna get into but just

503
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,290
remember that everyone makes mistakes
but some have no remorse or desire to

504
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,360
correct them

505
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,050
so sometimes when you get wrong didn't
you call that person out there going to

506
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,080
admit sometimes they're not

507
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,960
it's up to you to let it slide or not
but don't let it slide and then let it

508
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,930
fester you either call them out or you
say okay I'm setting that one up and

509
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,120
just gonna forget about just living let
live

510
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,380
but you have to make that choice it's
like we have so many people in here that

511
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,850
eat up themselves with all these issues
they have and sometimes it's just

512
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:37,190
literally you just have to say effort or
said no I'm going to fight this one it's

513
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,430
all you have to do that and never judge
someone more harshly than you want to be

514
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:46,580
judged for your failings there is not
one person in here i can look at and say

515
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:53,720
yeah you screwed up way worse than I
have no it's not about that it's like

516
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Chris trust me i probably couldn't wait
worst immunity if you have so it's like

517
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,649
it's like it's usually going to be me in
the room so it's like that's fine but

518
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,580
understand that it's like when you're
trying to go after someone that did

519
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,380
something wrong

520
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,650
are you judging more harsh because you
think that you deserve that because they

521
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,090
felt worse than you

522
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,090
it's like we are so

523
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:21,569
one forgiving in this industry when
someone makes a mistake it's like when a

524
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:23,189
breach occurs

525
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:26,428
how many people are going to say well i
hope i learned a lesson from that helps

526
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:30,660
some of the people that got breached
learn from it or not let's get popcorn

527
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:39,058
to start the means they got on what
idiots yahoo it's like who does that you

528
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:44,130
know is that I'm a horrible person that
was saying it's like see no one feels

529
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,390
worse than me

530
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:50,819
why do we do that if you're going to try
to do that

531
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:53,819
why are you trying to add some of the
conversation to make it better

532
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,808
it's like you're just adding fuel to the
fire and no one needs to see the world

533
00:39:57,809 --> 00:39:58,380
burn

534
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,069
so that's really key part of course song
that's like so you gotta do something

535
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,979
about it stop letting it fester and
start trying to be part of that solution

536
00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:08,339
and when you help someone who takes
advantage of you

537
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:13,589
that's not on you that's on them I've
literally had people that have helped

538
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:19,709
and it's like thanks and I and I've
never heard nothing back from that

539
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,448
doesn't make me stupid

540
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:25,829
that makes me someone is trying to do
good that's on them for but I feel

541
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:29,249
guilty about it thinking to myself well
you're stupid you shouldn't let them do

542
00:40:29,249 --> 00:40:32,428
that you knew they were going to go
there it's like that you're an idiot

543
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,679
Jason which you know I hear that a lot

544
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:40,049
it's like but still you gotta learn from
that it's understand that its own nail

545
00:40:40,049 --> 00:40:48,119
now the next one this happened two weeks
ago this was the part in the talk when I

546
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,150
talked about being a new at DEFCON
because trust me a DEFCON twell i was

547
00:40:54,150 --> 00:41:01,259
reading cumulus ok there was no one that
rig coming they're still pictures on the

548
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:02,429
internet which you know

549
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:06,119
yeah it's like i spray-painted my hair
blue and it got worse from there okay

550
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:11,159
trust me but i still have friends and
still people that actually met me at

551
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:14,099
DEFCON 12 instead hey maybe we should
give this video a little bit more of a

552
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:18,719
chance and they stayed with me and then
I became part of that community and I

553
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,469
became part of this community because of
that that was the first con ever went to

554
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:25,650
and i went to it wrong and i went to a
horrible

555
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:30,900
well guess what that's not limited to
hacking because my son wanted to go play

556
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:41,249
airsoft and I was like awesome air salt
that sales so cushy right that sounds

557
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:45,899
amazingly fun it's like other
marshmallows involved or what

558
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,880
no there is really hurt babies that hurt
like a mother you know that calls you to

559
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,900
believe

560
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,749
ok but you know what we're news we went
there and that's the way we dress that's

561
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:03,509
my eleven-year-old daughter okay she is
my daughter and y'all should fear for

562
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:04,259
that statement

563
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:09,659
okay she is a hacker and that's how she
is my son wants to be a chef and I think

564
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:13,409
he's amazing and my only rule in my
house is you do whatever you want to be

565
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:17,219
just be the best you can be at it that's
why my bio says I was the best janitor

566
00:42:17,219 --> 00:42:20,130
for two years in the road from mcdonalds
Southeast Texas region

567
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:25,919
I'm proud of mother fact i was one of
the best tenders they had it's like so I

568
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:30,419
tell him to be doing that so he wanted
to go play airsoft that's what he wanted

569
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:37,140
to do for his birthday so we went to the
airsoft range in short sleeve shirts my

570
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,549
daughter was in yoga pants

571
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:45,538
it's like you know and we went and play
with guys that were in full tactical

572
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:49,829
armor and gear like we're like going
into Mogadishu or something i'm like

573
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:50,849
what up

574
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:58,469
I mean I get there and I'm like this is
not soft or area it's like what's going

575
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:02,789
on here and they're having them and we
look really bad a boom you know but no

576
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:08,130
that was the only time that picture was
in effect before it started but do you

577
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:13,949
know what they did did they help us out
today hey guys be careful you're not

578
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:23,849
wearing the right gear no guys in full
tactical armor spawn camp and shot an

579
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:26,270
eleven-year-old girl repeatedly

580
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:32,840
because screw us were news and we
weren't prepared that tall that's a

581
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:38,900
lesson right that shows how stupid we
were for trying to get involved in

582
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,710
another activity to get involved into
another thing that other people like

583
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,370
other people like doing and other people
actually made it into their profession

584
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:52,339
that showed us we're a bunch of news and
we got what we deserved

585
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,260
I'm literally as i was walking off the
field

586
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,310
I went by the tallest guy in tactical
gear and I said you know this is really

587
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,270
refreshing around playing call of duty
and stuff and a twelve-year-old spawn

588
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,060
camping stuff i don't usually get to see
them in person

589
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:12,590
what did that guy say that mean
nothing's nothing cowardly shot an

590
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:16,850
eleven-year-old girl repeatedly because
he was trying to teach us a lesson we

591
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,830
learned a lesson

592
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:23,390
my son hasn't asked to go back yet my
son was really involved in that and

593
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,190
really want to get involved in that

594
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:31,850
how do we do that to the people in this
community don't know how to tell them it

595
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:36,920
can do the metasploit don't know how to
use kali linux freaking noobs and they

596
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,870
want to get involved in what we're doing

597
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:45,680
how do we treat them how many people do
we burn out before they even start

598
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:53,089
because we're better than them and I've
got a surprise where you were not if

599
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:56,480
you've got something that you're
passionate about you should be sharing

600
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,990
that passion not disparaging someone
else's in judging what their passion

601
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:06,770
isn't if it's worthy of being included
into what you do that's not our decision

602
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:14,840
to make but we can influence it we can
ruin lives or help lives just by the way

603
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:20,060
that we have our attitude when we come
across a new it's like there is nothing

604
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:25,460
wrong with wanting to be around others
to enjoy what you do they could have

605
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,120
welcomed us and we could have been part
of that and we would have gone out and

606
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,180
bought the right arm because lord knows
I wasn't wearing a short-sleeved shirt

607
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,100
again

608
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,120
it's like and we would have gone there
and we've done that we come back the

609
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,430
next time better prepared with more
information on how to do it and we would

610
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:46,330
have gotten slaughtered but we would
learn and got involved in it and got

611
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,540
more involved in it but that didn't
happen

612
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,339
one of the things that most colleges
learning to make sure that the that may

613
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,660
God make sure that learning part of it
when i first went to DEFCON 12

614
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:04,240
what did i do I just a lot of Epping
pictures of people how many

615
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,910
conversations did I have with them

616
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:11,589
not many i thought that this is what
defcon was supposed to be so that's what

617
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:17,350
it was going to be for me you have the
opportunity to make this con or any kind

618
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:21,490
of you go to a learning experience
something that helps you with your

619
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,879
connections with your networking with
learning things because that's what

620
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,080
we're supposed to be here for not just
the party's not just for the hugs i know

621
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:35,890
that sounds crazy sacrilegious
mysteriously ok hey i would deny

622
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:38,980
everything but if I think we're being
recorded so it's like so is that

623
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,800
actually aren't already uploaded this
talk I just can't wait to see what it

624
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:47,620
looks like so seriously we need to be
more part of it and one of the things

625
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:54,250
that we need to stop talking about his
rock stars people have called me that

626
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:58,450
and they really were trying to be nice
and thought that was something that made

627
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:05,290
me happy i am not a rockstar there are
no rock stars in this industry

628
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:11,920
we're dentist do you know the guy who
created Invisalign braces because I'm

629
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,800
millionaire he's written books he has
changed people's lives he goes to Dennis

630
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,960
conferences and you know what happens
people

631
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,150
oh my gosh you're working over the
country sir could you please on your

632
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:29,350
book thank you very much can I get a
good he's awesome he goes all over the

633
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:33,250
world to do is conferences talking about
his creation in his discovery of

634
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,110
invisalign braces

635
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,440
do you know what happens when he walked
out of that conference he's an effing

636
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,320
dentist

637
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,570
he matters so little to me i didn't
bother researching with his name was

638
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:54,900
again to tell you what it was i don't
care don't care he's a dentist but he's

639
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:02,370
important in his field and just like
dentist security we tell people things

640
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:07,920
they need to be doing we tell them how
to practice good hygiene on the internet

641
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:18,150
when someone has a cavity or breach we
go in for invasive painful expensive

642
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:25,050
no one wants to deal with it but we
patch it and we fix that cavity or the

643
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,330
root canal those are really fun right

644
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:33,960
we do those and then we're done and just
like dentist who wants to hear us who

645
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,980
wants to see us who goes like oh great I
get to go see the business today

646
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,450
whatsoever--like ok I gotta talk to
information security department today

647
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:49,140
that's what we are we are not rock stars
in this industry we are dentist

648
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:55,080
we are here to try to make things better
just like a dentist is we are trying to

649
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:00,000
serve society in a better way to make
people better for this model that

650
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,070
whatever it's like you know it's like
that's what we are so whenever you see

651
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,520
someone that knows what they're doing

652
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,420
who's in here who's talking up here talk
to them down there

653
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,640
learn from them because they are not any
more special that you because you are

654
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,890
the same person they were before they
got up on the stage and you're the same

655
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:27,629
person as soon as they get off this
stage you're trying to learn my least

656
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:32,730
effective time at this conference is
right now because all I'm doing is going

657
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:38,520
blue to y'all and you're listening to it
when i get off this stage i get to

658
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,050
interact I get to talk i get to have
conversations that's the value i get

659
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,430
from coming to these conferences

660
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,790
that's why I go to these so many
conferences all over was also cause I'm

661
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,790
lonely but that's another issue still

662
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:54,950
it's the interaction is meeting people
that's what you should be doing so this

663
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:59,390
is the last part of the talk is the
greatest part who's going to admit

664
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:03,799
failure and the audience who's gonna
fire

665
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,420
yes all that was horrible

666
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,050
thank you for that one anybody else got
to get what yes

667
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:20,270
oh well okay hold on i'm sorry that's
not fail it's like yet they still had a

668
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:23,660
sequel injection that's not vulnerable
that's poor coding and that was a poor

669
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:27,649
developers fail okay because I i I've
gotten on a rant about sequel injection

670
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,310
is likely it's like I'm tired of being
called vulnerabilities that's bad

671
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,160
developing ok it's like we need to make
sure that we make a difference on that

672
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:44,180
one but yeah that was still pretty bad
but just yes we got a winner

673
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:55,850
so good I'm good I don't ever top that
100

674
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:14,750
yeah

675
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,530
then the other question

676
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,530
any questions

677
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:27,610
I'm there we go i can do that

678
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,720
alright thanks guys take off the off

679
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,320
oh and by the way yes there were several
fails in the talk including me using

680
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,760
comic sans it was at
