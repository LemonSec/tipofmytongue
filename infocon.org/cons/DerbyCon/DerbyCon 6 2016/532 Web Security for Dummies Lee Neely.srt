1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:15,229
ok

2
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:22,400
hi I'm Lee nearly i work at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory both in

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,000
the technical and the compliance sides
starting about 2009 I've got into this

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,539
habit of picking up a few certifications
it's kind of addictive so be careful if

5
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:38,089
you may have noticed one is not like the
others

6
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:42,379
i'm also a credit union to a certified
credit union director so that the last

7
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:48,739
one is certified credit union volunteer
the origin of this talk one of the

8
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,409
conference's i presented is the eye
socket Los Angeles my yearly convention

9
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:57,589
and the organizer Debbie and I were
talking about what can we do and she

10
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:02,210
said do you think you could do web for
dummies like I don't know

11
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,100
so this is sort of the genesis of this
isn't it's evolved a little bit since we

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,649
started it was actually an interesting
path to get here but I kind of figured

13
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,940
out some areas we want to talk about you
know first being keeping your

14
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,340
information say another about take
keeping a browser safe some about

15
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,480
keeping users safe and someone keeping
services safe if you're in the service

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:34,310
offering business up this is focused on
really on end users and another category

17
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,060
of group that i found a willing to take
a lot of risks on what they're doing

18
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,580
security professionals

19
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:49,940
I resemble that remark so when we
started that was a big thing but lately

20
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,830
we spending a lot of time talking about
ransomware but the basics still remain

21
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,610
the same

22
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,550
user to make it easy so we'd have him
not make it so easy there reuse and I

23
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,649
can change credentials I'm what we had
360 myspace credentials release 217

24
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,420
million linkedin credentials and just
this week 500 million yahoo username

25
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,559
password combinations do you suppose
some of them still work in other

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,890
contexts

27
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,429
the other thing that people forget to
think about is open source intelligence

28
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,790
information people use for security
questions or related to the passwords a

29
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,370
pic often can be found through social
media corporate websites personal

30
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:42,959
website or blog and of course the other
big thing is bad choices my favorite fix

31
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,470
for this remains start turning on
multi-factor authentication alright lot

32
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,609
of things support it

33
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,830
there's been a little bit of the above
about whether we should use SMS ism as a

34
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,360
second factor that compared to that
username and password by itself it's

35
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,500
it's it's a raising the bar now for
those of in a while we're used to things

36
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,760
like these guys this is actually a
little better because we're not issuing

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,820
physical tokens to people a little more
scalable not as secure or course if

38
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,530
you're in a good space you're used to
using these things up anyway moving on

39
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,870
some of the basics we want the user to
get is that the password is like a 23

40
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,840
change it don't share it

41
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,920
pick a good one and in fact we really
should be looking at passphrases I mean

42
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,298
I know this is really basic to you guys
but I i know a lot of users don't get it

43
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,019
yet

44
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:43,530
you know and the xkcd correct battery
battery or staple phrase it plays but

45
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,769
then the next thing I have trouble
getting people to remember is using

46
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,820
special characters and the way of my
favorite special characters although

47
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,320
many sites don't support it the most
evil on the list is the space

48
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,100
however you how many like running John
and it's cracking passwords and you're

49
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,100
going to miss that there's a space at
the end of the password

50
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,679
this is kind of an important security me
like that doesn't work everybody but i

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
recommend playing with the others were
old friends you all you all seen them

52
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,000
before

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,420
and one more thing for our users get
them to use different passwords on the

54
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,760
different websites so that that release
of a bazillion username password

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,670
combinations don't work as well and then
of course you'll get some pushback

56
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,690
they're saying how do I keep track of
all that well you need a password

57
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,620
manager two of them that are out there
and I'm not this is not an advertisement

58
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,630
for either one but they're free one is
key pass and that stores passwords

59
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:51,469
locally or last past those start a storm
online cloud we could argue that last

60
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,670
pass has problems that thing fixed point
is I want you guys to use a password

61
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,720
manager and while I'm at it there's nice
still don't know the vulnerability that

62
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,750
will read the yellow sticky on the side
of your monitor with your password on it

63
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,360
now there's humans that do that but a
malware not yet i just thought that

64
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,500
still cranking out though I passed it
picked up a queue hasn't picked up the

65
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,210
keyboard with the sticky on it with the
password on the bottom or we have the

66
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:23,270
locking 3270 terminals and they kept the
key in the unlock top dress door or am I

67
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,880
just 2 i'm the old one in the morning so
the next thing we started running into

68
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,480
is users that want to run as
administrator

69
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,919
well in fact a lot of home computers you
get that dell out of the boxes you know

70
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,659
give me your name

71
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,660
create a password and your add me and
off you go

72
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,560
I and many homeys don't even think about
this but i also run the corporate use

73
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,880
that says the only way i can do my
freaking job is if I'm running as admin

74
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,390
all the time

75
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,789
that's an interesting battle to have it
in the event that they if you must have

76
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,690
users running as admin the first best
thing you can do is set UAC to always I

77
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,580
started looking at UAC bypasses and
every one of them depended on that not

78
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,440
being set to always so sure somebody may
find a way to bypass the always but the

79
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,400
first best step we can do is set it to
always and yeah that makes it annoying

80
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,870
the next thing we should do is change
the dedication behavior because how many

81
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,330
of you click the yes no button by
accident and click the wrong value i

82
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,219
have two more than I want to admit so we
want to change the authentication the

83
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:46,900
proper credentials state so at least you
then get a username prospered problem

84
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:53,620
that slows you down even in the heat of
adrenaline and yes you will become the

85
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,450
subject of dart boards but you've
compromised and and trying to keep keep

86
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,370
the bar high

87
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,570
the next area i want to move into is
what we're doing with our browsers so

88
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,400
because we still have our old friends of
malware and now we've got our ransomware

89
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,830
coming in to bother us as well and the
one of the biggest areas of concern i

90
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,200
have is plugins the acrobats the silver
like the quick times i love you have

91
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,560
this library of plugins in your browser
some of which you don't even know where

92
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,650
they're all of which have a mortgage all
have security and trade off i recommend

93
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,080
taking a look every now and then do you
need them

94
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,270
what happens if you turn that unknown
plug-in off does does the world stop you

95
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,260
get fired

96
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,360
odds are no but something might get
inconvenient but the 1i love to pick on

97
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,990
the most and we all should be picking on
the most is flash

98
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,790
I mean we've got a disabled flash but
not that flash and not that flash but

99
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:57,850
that one I think we patched the adobe
flash player at least monthly for what

100
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,450
two years three years now that dance is
getting old

101
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,030
and really with html5 it's becoming the
point where we can turn the flash off if

102
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,099
nothing else set it up as an ask only or
use it put in a plug in the tsr plugin

103
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,780
that keeps it off unless you really
really want it on my even ran into a

104
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,460
banking site that had one run flash the
site work fine with the nose thing that

105
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:29,080
was like WTF so another 1i think we can
live without java in the browser anymore

106
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,279
now I there used to be all kinds of cool
things mostly menus that people didn't

107
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,950
job i think that is like gone the way of
the dinosaur so take job out of it and

108
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,539
now here comes the hard one

109
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:47,110
how about turning that bad boy off ah
caveat it breaks things good and evil

110
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,560
and we can we we know that a lot of
attacks the leverage javascript so this

111
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,680
is a hard one to sell need we know
things like no script that can turn it

112
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,390
on and off

113
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,810
oh and you can actually even you can
also disable event to mention on flash

114
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,209
while it's built into the edge browser
you can disable it was a seven-point up

115
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:13,630
so another avenue a little more fruitful
is let's talk about ads we know that

116
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,959
there are a number of ads sources that
have been compromised and there's now

117
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,529
we're coming through those add side so
it's time for an adblocker and there are

118
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,110
some good ones and they do need to be
tuned

119
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,010
they don't let you can set it and forget
it but you really need to tune it they

120
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,120
will break some commerce sites and other
validation services but even if you

121
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,480
happen to use your turning it off for a
single page but turning it back on

122
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,850
we're still what how well we're headed
where we were so I've been you i've been

123
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,630
using this person it's actually kinda
interesting what breaks like the most

124
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,720
common is when I'm getting ready to do
that the check out on an online purchase

125
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,400
are also let's get rid of HTTP and https
only you've all heard of it let's

126
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,829
encrypt the cost of certificates has
come way down everybody supporting them

127
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,769
now

128
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:05,209
the argument of it taking too much
overhead i think is that ship has sailed

129
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:08,209
it sit there they're cool they're fine

130
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:17,509
and when we have multiple browsers we
gotta remember to patch them all people

131
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:21,589
tend to forget that beyond the microsoft
update they have to update Firefox and

132
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:29,239
Chrome Safari edge tour whatever i've
run into users to collect browser types

133
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:33,529
like badges it didn't work and it
doesn't your your stuff doesn't work

134
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,470
because it doesn't work in Opera so it's
crap

135
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,809
no but whatever we got my thing just
keep them all updated if you have to

136
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,749
have you know if you have to have the
you know the ring of power of browsers

137
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:51,529
cool just keep them maintained so then
this journey I started thinking about

138
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:56,119
what about our mobile users the guys who
can't live that they're not online in

139
00:10:56,119 --> 00:11:00,589
starbucks while they're ordering their
coffee right where you nose or suggested

140
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:07,699
that just me how it's just me but it
what I recommend is having a VPN that's

141
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:14,059
on all the time your routing / secure
path its man-in-the-middle resistant or

142
00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:17,660
tamper indicating a little fail
somebody's messing with it and it

143
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,199
provides a consistent . the internet
internet this really isn't as much about

144
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:25,008
privacy in this context although i like
them for corporate because it is about

145
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:29,119
privacy this is about you know avoiding
the Wi-Fi pineapple on the table in

146
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:35,540
starbucks Bob and unknown access . but
when you're doing it make sure it's full

147
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,219
tunnel i know we've set up non-full
tunnels for it so that only the

148
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,029
corporate taxes goes through but really
we need to look at the concept of the

149
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,499
dynamic permitir where all our traffic
is routed through the VPN and think

150
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,919
about if your corporate users if your
corporate services excluding corporate

151
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:57,139
laptops have a VPN itself logs in
whenever it's online your perimeter is

152
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:01,189
now extended with that mobile device
wherever it's sitting so all those other

153
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:05,059
things you put so hard to monitor and
watch are in line now if you're just a

154
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,839
home user i think half the half the
access points come with an openvpn

155
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,649
client about playing with it and there
are other ones that are out there that

156
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,430
are

157
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,380
available for free like pro x pn and
private Internet access and a few others

158
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:28,130
um there is one risk your VPN may fail
open we have to teach people to watch

159
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,570
for it but it's still raising the bar
right we're not we're not trying to jump

160
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,940
from zero and ivana we're trying to get
the bar up help the user out now with

161
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,810
all the stuff that's been going on a lot
of research some of the some of the

162
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,750
ransomware you know will act if you
start coming after us

163
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,899
people are starting to explore the
engine Onion Router you guys are all

164
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,370
familiar with it i'm sure and it has all
kinds of promise about protection and

165
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,950
eavesdropping and blocking advertiser's
the one weakness is and some of the end

166
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,930
exit points have been convinced by some
folks to reveal the clients identity

167
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,670
this is not cool but it is reality and
remember it's free so if you're in the

168
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,069
position where you need to do research
anonymously by an anonymizer service get

169
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:21,470
a contract in place but if you just want
to do casual research and occasionally

170
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,330
and you don't mind if you get exposed
tour is actually pretty cool but you

171
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,040
have to know what impact is if you take
the be of a site i know this is hard to

172
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,480
see you don't get a hell of a lot with
the tor browser and a lot of messages

173
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,260
about these things don't work up and you
can fix that tour contains the the keys

174
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,640
to its own destruction

175
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,110
you have to resist the temptation to
turn on services that will reveal your

176
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,540
identity but you can turn on browser
plugins you can turn on JavaScript you

177
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,800
can go have at it but you really want to
try and keep it at the highest possible

178
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,579
setting but still have it usable so I'll
just something I started running as I'm

179
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:09,199
really interesting phenomenon with tour
but really annoying that that folks like

180
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,950
CMU revealing who the users were oh now
how about switching to browser

181
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,709
strategies using a different browser for
secure transactions like banking and

182
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,420
regular surfing for porn

183
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,420
the internet was built for porn right
guys

184
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,570
and in order to help you reinforce it
you want to whitelist and blacklist and

185
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,190
there are plugins for this yes I said
the p word again but the idea is in the

186
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,510
browser that's for breaking the only
thing you whitelist is your banking

187
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,010
sites and then the browser for general
blacklisting so you to help you from

188
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:53,189
making a mistake but even so you only
want to use one secure service at a time

189
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,420
because you don't want any
cross-contamination of any weakness from

190
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:04,260
one to the other because you know
they're not equally secure right and you

191
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,550
know exit exit bank exit be of a before
going to wells particle or whatever fill

192
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,019
in fill in the blanks you know as much
fun as you're having shopping on Amazon

193
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:19,440
getting stuff finish that up before you
want your banking site and but make sure

194
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,620
you save the credit cards online so that
i can get them ok so on FB and actually

195
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:33,720
a better strategy that we were we were
chewing the fat nanny up and edit is

196
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,120
square chapter meeting a friend of mine
said you know even better is to have

197
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,050
separate machines whether it's a virtual
machine or even better still a separate

198
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,660
laptop that it's the only place in the
world you do your banking from and the

199
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,300
reason we're talking about this we're
talking about this in a ransomware

200
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,189
target environment so you're basically
you're going to haul this thing out only

201
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,630
use it for that purpose and put it away
make a new backup new updates at that

202
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,490
time but otherwise it's it's it's
offline so it's a much harder target

203
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:10,440
because it's not reachable but you gotta
not change the scope don't get out there

204
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,610
and go click on something cool while
you're doing it are the game could be up

205
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,620
because that's something cool could undo
this whole process which reminds me

206
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,670
that my buddy Dan gave me this phrase
and i love it and it's the charity

207
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,560
keyboard interface is the most difficult
piece in the i.t chain i like charity

208
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,910
here keyboard interface way better than
pep cap but which we all know kept-kept

209
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:42,000
some users click anything i have a
friend who his husband would regularly

210
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,980
call me and say I need you to come one
messed-up berries computer that gets old

211
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,970
he didn't believe you had time to learn
how to be safe online the problem solved

212
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,790
itself because they moved

213
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,449
that's not the optimal solution and not
generally available as an option

214
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:10,860
the other thing I found is that there's
two ways that are our best late security

215
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:15,329
plans can get undone one is you get an
errant user who click click the wrong

216
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:21,569
pop up at the wrong time the way you
never thought of and then they get hack

217
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:27,329
the other is you got the really smart
user who spends hours head down trying

218
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,540
to get around the protection because
they want to get something done rather

219
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,050
than calling the helpdesk to get an
exception there

220
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,500
the end result is equally bad but we
have to keep an eye out for these guys

221
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:47,070
because they're very persistent or very
errand so you know on the line of

222
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:52,290
looking smart we need user to be aware
of users links that aren't what they

223
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,730
claim to be we've all heard over links
and I know that we can use job and

224
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,790
obfuscate javascript excuse me to change
what happens when they're having over

225
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:06,990
but for the most part they're they're
not that's not happening to run this

226
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,610
site you need to install the following
software we click right

227
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,550
just install it that's ok not so much of
course beware of insecure plugins I'm

228
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,760
sorry to keep beating the plug-in flying
i was too been on a plug-in tear when i

229
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,890
was writing this deck and carefully
examine certificate problems

230
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,330
particularly on mobile the killer on
mobile is it's really hard in the mobile

231
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,020
interface to see enough information to
really make a good to see

232
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,400
in about a certificate from my advice
generally is if you get a prompt like

233
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,700
that whether it's on your desktop or on
your mobile

234
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:48,270
don't click OK unless you really really
know which also comes back to now if it

235
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,300
also moves into the server space for
those of us providing services because

236
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,409
we need to provide good certificates for
users that they won't get that prompt

237
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,600
and that comes with a cost and comes
with some inconvenience but the first

238
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,659
thing i want to touch on again when you
have services that you're providing

239
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,990
others use https by those certificates
disabled insecure algorithms the ones

240
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:16,260
that are you know your you know your
null cipher is your sl3 your TLS 10 get

241
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,190
rid of and by the way it may take some
testing to get rid of TLS one don't have

242
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:26,310
it actually stay off but you gotta start
its journey started beginning i turn off

243
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:31,379
insecure methods I mean HTTP traces on
more than it should be is just intended

244
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,640
as a testing mechanism was intended for
use in production servers

245
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:44,820
however that little gem got kind of lost
along the way using use verifiable

246
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:52,139
certificates like i said i don't think
that we want users clicking on the ok

247
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,030
button here we won't want those coming
up if we're doing if we're doing

248
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,350
something from a corporate perspective
like we're putting up a

249
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,280
man-in-the-middle proxy or something has
its own CA we need to have a way to

250
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,129
seamlessly push that to the users so
they're not seeing this problem up

251
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:18,150
yes they'll click and they'll install is
tickin don't let them do that another

252
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,320
thing something that the bane of all our
existence and this is more not in the

253
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,030
security side more on the IT side they
never have time to patch or they never

254
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,590
have time to patch fast enough we have a
culture change we have to keep things

255
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:38,010
updated the OS the website all the
layers a fight i fought for years is

256
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,290
getting people to look beyond the OS to
go up and patch the web server and the

257
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,580
applications here

258
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,720
most importantly these three favorite

259
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,990
I mean how many of you guys have seen
too many updates for these some of them

260
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:58,400
have now got automated plugins where you
can have it automatically patch it for

261
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,900
you after a certain interval which I do
on my web press site because i never

262
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,610
have enough time to patch it it takes
care of it for me and telling dude i

263
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,928
stopped waiting for you

264
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:14,600
I fixed it for you arm it saves me a lot
of great help and you can buy services

265
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,750
that keep things updated do you have to
host your external content management

266
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,030
you know your external web price press
for wordpress or drupal asst Jimmy lab

267
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,049
darn it

268
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:30,080
drupal site yourself or can you hire
somebody that's really good at patching

269
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:38,090
it and run it there particularly force
external and once again on your services

270
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:45,709
disabled what you don't need change the
default accounts we still get pen test

271
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:53,960
that find the default passwords and
usernames we're all guilty or maybe

272
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,620
that's just me

273
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:01,428
anyway i think it's i think it's all of
us we all get in a hurry to get 10 tests

274
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:10,039
if you find things fix them and use what
tools are out there free ones are good

275
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,240
ones

276
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,510
so here we are I'm almost done we talked
about user you will use your habits

277
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:23,030
password habits server services habits
all these things that can be cleared up

278
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:29,270
all of which raised the bar on the
weaknesses of our system with that

279
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,720
questions stunned silence tomatoes

280
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,520
well thank you very

281
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,520
