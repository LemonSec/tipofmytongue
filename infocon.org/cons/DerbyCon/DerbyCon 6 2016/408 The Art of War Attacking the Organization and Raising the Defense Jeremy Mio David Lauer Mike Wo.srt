3
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,649
okay alright so we're giving this talk
we had about three of us we're trying to

4
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,780
go pretty quickly here a lot of want to
cover a little different than normal

5
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,350
security awareness talk trying to use
yard war attacking the organization as

6
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:46,649
well

7
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,640
racing defense you need to combat your
security word strategy and different

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,980
methodologies that might not work the
same way every everywhere right

9
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,718
we can't just use videos we can't just
use certain things anthologies it's not

10
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,799
going to be a one-way tool the work
across every organization every industry

11
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,740
you know worldwide right everywhere has
different cultures every company or

12
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,548
business government entity and its own
terms so that we get through here we

13
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,810
have a little guy that kind of what he's
talking about for a very long time

14
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,720
right so the best military scratches
that around so you know you have to know

15
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,960
know your enemy right nowhere to me know
yourself you can win you know a hundred

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,389
battles right it's the same insecurities
where it's right we need to know our

17
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,920
employees they need to know or Never
with right so i know from Victoria CISOs

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,869
or security organizations managers
security professionals right you gotta

19
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,200
get a win first and then you can you can
go forward right you can expect to go in

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,220
to win without

21
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,758
tragic okay so we're gonna we're gonna
split this up here we have a couple

22
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,720
things we have executives right you need
to have a lot of talking to the

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,200
executives his hands where it was right
who doesn't like talking the executives

24
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,519
right i mean that they don't like
talking about but you definitely need to

25
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,490
be prepared to can't go in there without
a proper slide deck ready higher talk to

26
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,540
me to know what they like what they
don't like when you're therefore they

27
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,450
might not even know why they're right
now na they sit there they go through a

28
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,160
lot of things you really have a plan
around it we need to engage your

29
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,940
co-workers little differently we need to
get them interested in security we need

30
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,609
to get them engaged learning videos a
lot of cool things up like these cons

31
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,590
you know people come here first
recognized his first derby car basis

32
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:05,920
look at that you guys don't know what we
won't be here so so have you know it's

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,250
you know these cars have a lot of things
everyone gets inserted it was like why

34
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,760
keep going to this thing which go the
first we're going to go you know until

35
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,709
the end of time you guys going back
right so I also connected security

36
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,670
organization right i mean there's hot
outside of your director workers with an

37
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,049
IP and then going you know outside the
business areas where you know they're

38
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,640
not tech-savvy not really no security
had a whole you know subculture to make

39
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,040
it thirty was a talk about the
subculture security earlier yesterday

40
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,640
and it's a little different you know you
gotta get people understand that self

41
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,018
also right everyone understands why you
were so cool right

42
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:50,290
you need to really kind of prep them for
that I you know and then as we go we

43
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,940
have you have and our little gifts so
we're going to have you know some

44
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:01,359
interaction here so first battle the
executives right you know when you go is

45
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,980
what you look like right this is what i
get when i go out there and not talking

46
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,569
from you know executive

47
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:11,290
words politicians right you got
politicians going in there i mean it's

48
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,719
it's really different battle you can I
get in my face with soap and or but

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,039
that's a that's a bandwidth histogram is
another thing you know you're right but

50
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,820
you can tell it like that right you
really have to give the engage with you

51
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,099
is like an email from all these things
right again if you put a bunch of stuff

52
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:34,690
you know compliance officers you know
your IT managers they know a lot of

53
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,259
flying stuff maybe someone a lot of
executive board those blinds politicians

54
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:43,960
I'm compliance you know all all the law
stuff they do they want they only want

55
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,310
to do certain things security right if
you get with all this jargon something

56
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,470
where you can hear the jargon spelled
out to be explained you know why what

57
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,099
why pci is this because you're taking
crackers with credit cards

58
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:02,199
why was it would take more fines oh well
okay is working out a little okay well i

59
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,889
don't care about it because working so
we'll talk about it right so he only has

60
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:13,389
one response so you know we've got you
know you really gotta when you engage

61
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:20,169
powerful to me or to say your executives
that your friends I have one will know

62
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,750
you don't want to get you if you don't
want to go to the exact level and you

63
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,159
get buy-in from them you need to go back
keep doing what you're right so

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,789
oh so you get one of the things i had
touched on it is using your perspective

65
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:38,110
right security perspective change step
back a little which we're getting better

66
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,860
at $TIME and then at least we'll talk t
minus CI levels but then when you're

67
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,289
talking you know cross two of the
council of war you know Frosty the

68
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:55,180
business verticals you have to take out
your life perspective right you have to

69
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,759
turn into a risk officer you know it's
just you really gotta look at it the

70
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,960
whole different level and really there's
only a couple things that they really

71
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,780
care and you know what do we need to do
they need to know they want answers

72
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,840
where they want to what do we need to do
they want to know how much is enough

73
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,280
right now how much we need how much is
it

74
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,260
off right and then you know the third
one seems so overdone it was really like

75
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,260
to connect across the first two
questions

76
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,690
oh go look at not working

77
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,200
ok so who can I trust

78
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,849
right so you need to be it you need to
be there and be confident you need to

79
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,460
really show them that you know what
you're going you can go on there so you

80
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:46,070
have all the certification also know you
just need to be very authority right you

81
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,669
need to go in there and really know what
you're talking about me to believe that

82
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:53,690
you know what you're talking right i
mean we go through all these social

83
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,120
engineering organization so what you're
saying is that you know in your meeting

84
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,340
right in a productive way right you need
to get that believe that you know you're

85
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,460
talking about because you do what you're
talking about right and also you need to

86
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,299
rely to measure right if you don't talk
to executives you need to have metrics

87
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,160
you to have measurable statistics and
some way if you go into an executive

88
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,390
meeting you don't have something that
backs up statistically you're walking in

89
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:29,690
right so you need something that you
don't have those statistics get them

90
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,080
from a different industry you know that
has no statistics at least have

91
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,250
something right if you don't have any
measure yourself or somebody else find

92
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,610
something else find some kind of
Institute have something to back you up

93
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,050
so they don't say hello statistics exist
i don't know around uploaded why did you

94
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,360
have fun I would you do that once you
pair right so you to happen and if

95
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,710
you're not taking your measuring and
have statistics now measure anything it

96
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,599
the littlest thing measure how many it
had a meaningful to write you can

97
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,210
measure a lot that you have a lot of
tickets you have a lot of stuff you can

98
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,570
do a lot of interesting metrics right

99
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:13,669
also another another big top questions
if they go in there and they say walk

100
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,950
you know we have this new thing and you
know we have this six in the road right

101
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:26,750
to hear all this business right here no
idea that was gonna happen right uh and

102
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,590
what do you do you have to answer
something you don't have to give an

103
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,789
answer but you can't hesitate right you
said what you know definitely packed

104
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:40,490
with that you know step back and say
yeah definitely back to that you know

105
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:43,970
what right let me get their contact
information feel that you're actually

106
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,850
going to follow up and you can save your
follow-up and you're going to email the

107
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,890
positive look at it or maybe they will
write you need to get that eating agent

108
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:59,689
after that meeting you get that all so a
lot of these things just kinda go over

109
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,800
how you know I obviously think exists i
didn't make these you know suggestions

110
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,920
up taking them multiple places for the
best talk so I went to was a bi guy

111
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:30,860
named Alan holler will know sands 4head
no-good bowtie bowtie for the man that

112
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,260

right so he gave a great talk about how

113
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:43,100
to talk right so this is all right at
the high school and great walk and he

114
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,400
goes through what they need to be called

117
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,490
your heart is racing

118
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:06,710
we're not raising right how all these
four parts look let's let's let's do

119
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,640

137
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,659
they can understand they don't really
like those things that like testing .

138
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:58,539
yeah and I mean obviously have those

have that will read or why that little

142
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,240
right you know or vice versa right
however your life

143
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,660
Austin industry right so delighted that
little right you know how to doesn't

144
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,350
just an example that's how we how do we
get there and then you explain this is

145
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,790
what we need to get there these are the
priorities these are they will they'll

146
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,389
start trusting right then if you have
management you need to take a different

147
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,480
approach right they're going to see that
like oh yeah let's do it

148
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,970
they want to know more right they want
to go more about 40 map or back to the

149
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,730
turkey model right you're gonna want to
do that but you know that's the market

150
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,480
we have so that's what you need to do it
right and you can go over those

151
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,839
management you want to go more in-depth
right and you want to do it you know how

152
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,010
poorly quarterly so you know you don't
want to go through the whole you know

153
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,100
you want to go and actually have
measurable statistics right then over

154
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:06,279
time you can do something like this and
hitting this off i'll be honest and

155
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,649
presentation we had and the story behind
you don't really need to read little box

156
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:16,120
here but they actually start doing the
metrics right so i actually saw a risk

157
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,380
reduction and they had a whole mythology
was approved of what that meant what is

158
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,860
reduced risk right but when you're going
exactly that's already you know you

159
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,510
basically the no statistical models
behind when we start doing this to start

160
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,620
going down right and this is where we
need to be and that's what's going to

161
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,380
get us to where we need to be this is
how much it's gonna be and that's what

162
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,230
you start to it

163
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:44,649
we're number one right using your
perspective rather than theirs right

164
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,160
need to set in their shoes you need to
get someone to trust and the council you

165
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,149
can kind of pressure slice right
probably try to go through you need to

166
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:53,350
practice

167
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,740
alright so you know the best victory the
best victory is uh when you understand

168
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,639
your own account not there right so you
need to meet the enemy or the executives

169
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,639
I mean on your truck's not there right

170
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:12,790
first impressions last a long time you
need to do this right first right and I

171
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,130
mean definitely go through it in and get
better and better over time if you

172
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,990
already had that

173
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,820
action but you need to get first
pressures are our last Soul so it only

174
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:30,540
comes with a care what how much right
you need to go in there was a very quick

175
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,399
couple slides explain everything

176
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,510
don't go into much detail the last
details that really want right and lower

177
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:41,069
management you know you need to go into
that more more more detail and use one

178
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,450
of the things use relevant stores i
can't tell you how many times gone in

179
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:51,209
and everyone will use the target they'll
understand it was bit what we want any

180
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:56,760
like credit card data are so we're going
to have a chat plz full not a retail

181
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,700
store so I'm a little politicians say
like what are really no details

182
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,360
does that mean the government can get to
a relevant store right that Alliance

183
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,920
your industry and if you can use
internal stories or even scenarios that

184
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,849
happen that you stop its home so much
more didn't realize that happens every

185
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,630
day right

186
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,680
we can go in there like we get a billion
logs per second are similar blocking

187
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,040
your thousands of tax report was that
you need to have more of a single base

188
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:40,649
now we need to engage your co-workers
right-to-work i'm going to talk about

189
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:45,240
the human element its nose no secret
that you know our weakest link we don't

190
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,550
catch you don't figure are you making
steak right security where this is going

191
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,609
to be an essential piece of your
security awareness program you have to

192
00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:03,959
train our people i was using you have to
have to train our people ready all the

193
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:08,160
different standards require clients on
its all that type of stuff or simply

194
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,310
checking that box because you know over
policies 10 we hand out secure coding

195
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,250
practices all that type of stuff we're
not really getting to the heart of what

196
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:22,020
we want to accomplish with security
awareness screamers these needs to be

197
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,780
more engaging and inspire change in our
company

198
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,949
we need to find a way of getting our
people to care about what we hear about

199
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:36,890
to care about you know when we see
something say something we see a problem

200
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,189
from the email phishing whatever the
case may be to actually take action on

201
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:46,250
that my organization we actually double
our security awareness program to think

202
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,750
like a leper because you know we weren't
really want to try to get people into

203
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,250
that mindset you know thinking through
things critically mystically logically

204
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,680
in the case of web application hacking I
know applying logic to code and

205
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,429
algorithms really what we're trying to
get a part of everything not only what

206
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:10,340
you know application should do but when
it's possible for you r QA t worry about

207
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:16,069
the should do is worry about the
possible is to do when we talk about

208
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,270
that you really are really trying to get
a how the White House application works

209
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,109
right and that why is a very important
distinction between security awareness

210
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,589
security knowledge Helen points out here

211
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:31,790
knowledge is just basically the
memorization of facts but until you

212
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,450
really get to know how and the why
you're only regurgitating information

213
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,130
that somebody else you know thought of
days weeks months centuries ago right

214
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,149
the problem is our co-workers you don't
have a job of their own do their

215
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:53,540
counties their sales there whatever this
year whatever practice there and they

216
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,909
have their own the job they have their
own goals throne possibly have to talk

217
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:05,480
to and whatever else we if we're heading
to their workload is not it's not

218
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,190
engaging in security training is seen as
just another added complexity of the job

219
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:15,710
i'm gonna create this culture box
checkers and the problem tenant and you

220
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,840
know what is the bare minimum i need to
do to satisfy security i see a lot of

221
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,280
chatter on Twitter about you know you
know we need to stop stop

222
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:30,980
you know even into our employees only
one compliment get that but I don't want

223
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,480
to or else it's easy to blame our users

224
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,060
the thing is they're not sitting in
dirty they're not sitting after-hours

225
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:47,810
local they're not watching talks on iron
ore following on twitter is see were

226
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,190
immersed in this industry were the ones
that are on the stuff on a daily basis

227
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:57,170
they're just simply trying not to lose
their job right and that's why I

228
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:02,720
strongly believe in this quote that was
in the gallery will book you know when

229
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,410
we focus solely on our security training
solely on lectures and paperwork and we

230
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:15,770
only concentrate on policies procedures
standards very focused very are really

231
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,090
sharing our knowledge of security now
we're not really inspiring anybody to

232
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,389
really do anything that's different than
what we normally do

233
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,870
I'm not saying you shouldn't have
lectures i'm not saying you shouldn't

234
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,350
have standard checklist the dollar and
work stuff but we have to inspire we

235
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,100
have to have fun with it you have to
make them have fun that they want to get

236
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:40,040
involved they want to take it beyond
simply just doing what we asked them

237
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,960
I'm security training to be engaging to
inspire think differently not just

238
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:52,160
blindly put in the Box my organization
together suggests an example of how to

239
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,050
go about doing this we put a little
event together

240
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:59,629
oldham I throughout the month october we
do a whole bunch of training different

241
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,140
games like i'm going to go over those
here in a second I'm gonna end of the

242
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,830
month we put together a three-hour event
that basically trying to mimic what we

243
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,120
see here at different conferences we go
over different training the games we do

244
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,520
lock-picking you do a whole bunch of
different things just to get people

245
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:23,420
involved last year we did watch top 10
training we did a whole bunch of capture

246
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:31,970
the flag lock sports play a bunch of
minigames cricket related one of the

247
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,020
games we played as a screensaver game
basically you go around if you catch

248
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,040
somebody with their workstation locks
you get two points they lose it .

249
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,960
managers are three points directors are
four points i had exactly does it

250
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,650
pictures like this and I just pull them
out of it but you know it was a way of

251
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,390
them holding each other accountable

252
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,220
it wasn't just me telling them not to
lock their workstations post drop

253
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,220
reminding them it was a weight of them
trying to hold each other accountable

254
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,500
what we saw is that within the first two
days of rioting had about 50 missions

255
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,860
today of people not blocking the
workstation and after two weeks we've

256
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,340
got it down to only three submissions
today people started having fun with you

257
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,909
start setting the screen savers points
for you and the one thing that really

258
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,080
touched home with all this that I got
this email from one of our admins and

259
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,980
long story short you know the very end
of it she said that you know he ran back

260
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,730
to his workstation to lock it because
you know we may have been taking a

261
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,930
little too extreme buddy closer play
games and that's basically the essence

262
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,020
of what i'm trying to get through here
is that you know people will get

263
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,200
involved will do things if they're
engaged for having fun with its

264
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,580
interactive I want to eventually put on
was just a lot of sport tournament there

265
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:49,720
was not looking for some reason but so
basically we just set up just a little

266
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,530
mini locks for tournament just lock
picking and the whole point of it wasn't

267
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,780
teach people how to blocks the point was
that you know all the weeks leading up

268
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,920
to this event

269
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,550
I you know I blocks out of my desk and
said hey I'm not buying you want to

270
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:09,010
practice wanna play and maybe a handful
of people came by every day and that was

271
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,910
5 10 15 minutes I got to talk to him it
may be I would never got to talking

272
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:18,580
before I know we they spent 10 minutes
trying to take a lot of nice but the 10

273
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,000
minutes just trying to figure out what's
going on their departments what projects

274
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,900
they were working on what things they
had going on so is more or less just

275
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,750
open up the lines of communication hears
from the cash this lack of amenities are

276
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,840
just some random pictures i have from
the events you know people are there

277
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,850
they're interested we handed out prizes
packets that we gave up these with the

278
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,719
awards we gave up with the capture the
flag until just five dollar little many

279
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,010
trophies we put together just stickers
because it was a web application

280
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:53,620
training we did we make it everybody
honorary . is so we gave up a little

281
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,279
advance

282
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:59,409
and you know of all people love it they
start having fun with it started you

283
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:05,200
know they all the word they all got
involved the ultimate that was just a

284
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:15,249
way of i connect them extra security
back for the organization so Dave Dave

285
00:23:15,249 --> 00:23:17,440
to the stage

286
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:27,279
ok so connecting ok so breaking the mold
can do what you're doing you get what

287
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,089
you got

288
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:36,070
oh that's kind of emo where I went with
a lot of my slides for this so we were

289
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:42,759
on the coffee station are curiously
enough is built points out that got to

290
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,839
make sure that people have their
caffeine and stay energized goes with

291
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:53,379
meetings and so we bring donuts we do
other things that keep people involved

292
00:23:53,379 --> 00:24:04,748
by Daily brought in pies national donut
day we had donuts click reset ok meeting

293
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:06,519
request everybody yes

294
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:13,149
so my philosophy is you need to accept
them or one of your teammates accepted

295
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:17,589
if you're actually in a meeting you in
where somebody is you can actually

296
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:23,080
influence what happens or at least keep
on top of it otherwise something happens

297
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,460
they just go and do the shadow I teeth
they and you find out about eight months

298
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:38,469
later so staying involved does it so
unicorn poster so you're walking down

299
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:43,330
the halls and you see your standard
security where this poster to go while

300
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,330
you just kind of go on by what you see
unicorn

301
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:52,030
sea unicorn on the wall and you suddenly
go

302
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:58,060
oh what's that you're going to actually
read it r & research that we found out

303
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:03,460
there working on so we are going to be
putting out a link eventually with all

304
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:08,800
these posted so you can download
modified redistribute check that every

305
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,870
so often hopefully we can make this more
standard type thing going forward if you

306
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,580
have submissions and ideas that you want
that you make up forward to us to open

307
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,580
them up there you know we can make it a
community of that

308
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,700

309
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,560

I have some speakers this talk with me

310
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,129

I think we got most of the content

311
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,240
copyright guys

312
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,240
yeah there's a few questions that he put
any questions you'd like to meet for the

313
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:48,280
audience also say some dead trying to
remember what the questions were what is

314
