1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
okay well I guess everybody is going to
be here is going to be here already so

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,059
i'm gonna go ahead and say that this was
originally an hour talk pretty much like

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,110
you're all the other stable talks work
so if it feels like I'm really hyped up

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,719
on caffeine and flying through the
slides

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,850
it's because i'm trying to get through
everything so uh let's start so what we

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,330
will cover intro overview of ICS
contrasting ICS nit the differences

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,750
between the two and similarities that we
have why this is scary and finally

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:42,390
called arms so intro for my my last name
is pronounced share a booker not the

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,489
gray not bougie law where I don't know
why they get those extra valves from it

10
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:54,269
but I share so i'll spend 30 plus years
in IT our last end of spent in various

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,770
security roles from network
administration system administration log

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,140
monkey IDs guy arm to finally
penetration testing the current company

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,760
i spent some time in the intelligence
community doing quote fun things just

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,259
leave it at that and i am currently a
senior security consultant sakura sakura

15
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,500
con and Alexandra we can do things for
you on so let's start with the overview

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
so what exactly are we talking about

17
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,200
so basically any system that is designed
to allow maximum control over a complex

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,540
environment using minimal human
interaction are these can be far-flung

19
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,970
enterprises across you know hundreds of
thousands of acres and miles could be

20
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,990
dangerous toxic chemicals that we don't
want people interacting with our ability

21
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,229
to react faster than even reflexes are
generally things that humans are not

22
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,908
welds humans at the time that they were
designed these systems were not well

23
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,290
adapted to do as technology has
progressed will see that that is not

24
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,190
necessarily been the case but we're
still dealing with these systems that

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,579
are currently in place

26
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,310
and then this 882 guide if anybody's
board has problems sleeping at night i

27
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:22,000
highly recommend that you read this guy
you will go to sleep very quickly so

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,230
measurements

29
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,970
what do you mean by measurements and so
these systems were lying was called the

30
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:34,270
feedback we are in pitt control theory
and all this again missed eight hundred

31
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,590
documentation stuff goes into this so
proportional produces change

32
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:46,240
proportional to error or value higher
slightly change you know where you know

33
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,820
it depends on the amount of error
depending on the change uh interval

34
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,620
produces change based on the duration of
arabic so if you've got something that's

35
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,750
out of black and it continues to be out
of whack and it's going for an hour the

36
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,490
change in keeps increasing to try to
bring value down i'm finally derivative

37
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:12,459
prisons change based on the slope of
change slope keeps going high up it goes

38
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:17,019
up corrected slight little bit of change
it then goes to a slight change to

39
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:17,860
correct

40
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,920
I'll most of these are not necessarily
digital systems but mostly analog so you

41
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,390
have some fuzzy logic controllers in
here are which are you and generally

42
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,980
values between 0 & 1 are off by little
slightly true

43
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:39,940
ok we adjust a little bit off by a lot
very true we adjust by a lot there are

44
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,780
no go to various no Goldilocks value on
these things they're constantly adapting

45
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,750
constantly changing to the environment
so there we go two types of processes

46
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,900
that these systems involved so discreet
industrial robotic and prop production

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,720
of individual units widgets license
plates you know stamping things out

48
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,220
constantly day and day out you know
basically what everybody thinks i was

49
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,260
like a robotic factory this is the type
system that you would find their batch

50
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:19,810
input process output pharmaceuticals
chemicals through so much stuff goes in

51
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,399
magic happens

52
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,349
the individual stuff

53
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,960
goes out arm generally batches limited
to small and medium amount of materials

54
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:37,020
arm so you're not dealing with vast huge
gallons upon gallons of stuff you

55
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,900
generally have like the Justin
Heisenberg here small individual cooks

56
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,820
that you do and take care of with these
systems are continuous that's when we

57
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:55,020
think of like power generation our air
traffic control different systems like

58
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,880
this that are on and constantly turning
no matter what constitutes put materials

59
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,300
to constant output a product large
quantities of details and we have a

60
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,690
hybrid which is one system multiple
systems connected in line connected in a

61
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,090
variety of different locations

62
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,750
it all depends on how everything in our
acts together how inputs are handled how

63
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,890
the outputs are handled these are
obviously the most complex systems and

64
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:29,820
the hardest of all to maintain patch
upgrade control stow these can be a

65
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:36,330
absolute nightmare to secure so if
you're dealing with these types of

66
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,250
systems you have to be extremely careful
because any slight change to make while

67
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,120
looking at it can amplify itself across
the entire network and you can end up

68
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,390
knocking things over which as we all
know it's bad and so we go into

69
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:57,599
contrasting ICS nit so hardware IT
everyone's familiar with these types of

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,070
things servers workstations network
equipment routers switches magic boxes

71
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:09,060
that we all know and love human-machine
interface then we have data historians

72
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,230
control servers and PLC's this be

73
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,340
these may not necessarily be with people
are familiar with arm

74
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,919
hm i can be a nice little workstation
that you sit in front of us and look

75
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,070
like you're doing your normal office
tasks or it can be a giant

76
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:31,430
huge in interface that you're standing
in front with all the dials and widgets

77
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,520
and lights and stuff that you're looking
at a dentist Orion is generally a

78
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,198
day-to-day basis of the values and
different types of things that have gone

79
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,310
through the history that you use to
essentially say we are extremely out of

80
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,060
whack

81
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,849
we're a little out of whack we're doing
good or wow we're doing amazing

82
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:57,319
this is a type of equipment that you
wouldn't bc to keep track of the

83
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,319
information finally control servers and
PLC's basically keep everything in check

84
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:10,249
and do what you need to do with these
types of systems armed and it's kind of

85
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:17,150
going over there are network equipment
same type of situation of remote

86
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,650
telemetry terminal telemetry units
depending on the vendor they will either

87
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,909
say one of these basically just party
use what everybody knows what they're

88
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:35,330
called data concentrators otherwise
known as media converters are they can

89
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,529
be dumb little boxes that you just plug
in and switches of fiber to a serial or

90
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:45,620
vice versa or they could be giant things
that are interrupt itself huge devices

91
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,560
that you have to be careful of when
you're knocking using when you're

92
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,589
talking we're trying not to knock these
things over

93
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,899
just go to deploy later I promise oh
yeah

94
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,849
digital protective relay and intelligent
and devices these are usually safety

95
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:07,969
systems that are designed to either cut
off power flow flow chemicals whatever

96
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:14,389
else for to help monitor things like
that to go back to being faster than

97
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:20,060
human reflexes to control these uh
software

98
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,400
generic OS your windows or linux through
things like that

99
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,330
these are generally monolithic kernels
for service for workstations commodities

100
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,370
and these are patched and updated on a
regular basis right everybody not their

101
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,799
head vs these are patched and updated on
a regular basis our office productivity

102
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,510
suites antivirus heads the whole you
know kit and caboodle of different

103
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:50,480
things that we're all used to dealing
with not so an ICS it can be but

104
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,470
generally that's not was put out on the
network these types of things with

105
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:00,980
real-time operating systems are these
are designed differently than what we're

106
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,940
used to with monolithic kernels on
different scheduling schemes that focus

107
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,320
on eliminating not locks and resource
hogging because if you're running a

108
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,720
nuclear power plant the last thing you
want to worry about is resource hogging

109
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,740
or a lock on a process that controls
your cooling or more power generation or

110
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,100
the control rods or different things
like that you want to make sure that the

111
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,450
information that is necessary to
maintain that safety that system is

112
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,890
flowing so you'll have time to see here
away from windows to decide to release a

113
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:40,819
process or start a thread or different
things like that arm making these tend

114
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,920
to reboot if a halt or other system
delays encounter so if you feed it weird

115
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,240
data or it gets weird data it
essentially throws up a kernel panic and

116
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,930
reboots and you probably never know what
happened to it but that's how it was

117
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,229
designed it's not designed to be able to
handle that type of information it's

118
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,400
designed just to say

119
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,400
nope done click and go back to a regular
operating site

120
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,780
these are typically not patched or
updated because we have support

121
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,709
agreements and depending on your vendor
depending on the contracts and stuff

122
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,640
that you sign you may not be able to
patch it you may have to go to the

123
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,930
vendor and say I want to do this upgrade
and they can look at you and say what's

124
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,660
nice one things but

125
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,959
sorry Bob you bought this this is what
we offer arm and the popular versions

126
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:41,599
units are QX powers that the ex-works
and everyone's favorite ATM software

127
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:49,459
windows CD r I T protocols everyone's
familiar with them

128
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:55,128
ethernet tcp/ip Wi-Fi cetera
well-documented involves some have

129
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:00,110
security built-in you know but it
basically you know we we're all familiar

130
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,689
with this having been here just this
weekend right

131
00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:14,660
so yeah ICS protocols when I say ancient
design i'm not joking like we're talking

132
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,750
from why be the Paleolithic era of
computer science when these things were

133
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,269
designed when the thought that somebody
would do something bad with these

134
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:30,980
protocols was just a foreign concept
because who would do anything like that

135
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,050
we're all good people good people don't
do things with back with protocols so

136
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:42,560
why design security who cares are simple
design is best

137
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:51,529
modbus armed mob bosses the window
looking protocol from ICS are yeah it's

138
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,399
it's it's just precious

139
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,279
it really is are basically master
construct request sends out the slaves

140
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,199
slaves respond everything's happy
everybody talks to each other and it's

141
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:14,329
beautiful combine our world for some
complex it is better we have the mp3 we

142
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:21,410
have dv3 kind of looked at modbus and
when i'm not going to be like that i'm

143
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,790
going to include anything and everything
they could ever possibly be used to

144
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,740
support this type of system i'm going to
throw it in here and hope to god that

145
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,340
somebody somewhere will eventually use
it

146
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:43,030
it's got everything it is just yeah you
want flags and we got flags you what

147
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,579
files we could send files analog input a
problem digital input

148
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,960
no problem yeah it's it's basically your
you know

149
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,230
come one come all it's a fire sale type
of protocol are many years old particles

150
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:06,490
can be encapsulated ethernet tcp/ip
Wi-Fi and GPRS if I remember the talk

151
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,740
that was given by somebody who and I
forget now I meant looking up who walked

152
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,690
around with the packet radio it was able
to figure out the communication

153
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,670
protocols for all the Transformers in
the entire area and then just decided

154
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,540
one time to wonder if i should have done

155
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,200
yeah yeah it was able to get into the
entire system with just a packet radio

156
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,720
because these are the type of things are
capsulated with that and all equipment

157
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,050
may not work and the media converters
bumps in the wire are and that people

158
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,430
understand these protocols very well
these protocols were not designed with

159
00:13:48,430 --> 00:14:01,120
security so kidding in a shark tank and
all right business concerns SLA for

160
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,620
critical systems and processes regular
frequent windows unplanned outages can

161
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,450
be bad night life threatening and if
anybody anybody go to the sales guy talk

162
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,020
for sands that if he says it's
life-threatening it's not like right now

163
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:21,730
I'm sorry you can you can deal with the
day of downtime not so much with ICS arm

164
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:29,230
down time is usually expensive even if
its plant on when you're breaking down a

165
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,090
power plant to do an upgrade you
scheduled this year

166
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:41,350
23 years advanced these are often
delayed can't exactly do your

167
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,520
maintenance on a nuclear plant a few
easy Anna when there's Hurricane Katrina

168
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:45,910
come

169
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,910
about a day or two away be a bad idea

170
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:56,439
I'll their unplanned is when it gets
very expensive and the lawyers start

171
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,830
looking at chapter 13 are these can
actually be life-threatening are big

172
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:09,820
ones usually make the news congressional
hearings whitepapers dogs and cats

173
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:18,070
living together goes or mass hysteria
that type of thing underneath array of

174
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:24,190
commodity hardware variable regulation
ability to tweak and find setup we're

175
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,280
all for Barry with the general
procurement process of established IT

176
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,569
ICS to restrict the amount of generally
proprietary hardware and software

177
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:37,630
vendors love this because they can
essentially charging and say nice

178
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:44,650
network you got there be a shame if you
didn't have anything anymore so our

179
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:53,620
older equipment may have to be clutched
we may have to sit here and go okay now

180
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:00,340
it works uh encapsulation can help up
moderate the substantial regulation

181
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:06,100
Oh newark generally has a good handle on
how things work in power power

182
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,770
generation USDA is the same for
pharmaceuticals SP anything for

183
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,990
pharmaceuticals depending on the state
you live in Texas maybe not so much on

184
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:21,970
the regulation part o California maybe a
little bit more than necessary depending

185
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:29,500
all patches and upgrades usually depends
on the vendor some are really good with

186
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,380
patching and doing the necessary
security work

187
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,330
others are not others are basically what
we designed that 10 years ago yeah we

188
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:45,100
are we don't even offer that anymore why
are you still running it uh security

189
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,260
here's the fun part we all have a robust
solutions commodity scanners establish

190
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,260
methodologies many security
professionals are familiar with this

191
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,510
body of knowledge NASA's and map always
vulnerable useful tools that we know

192
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,370
about ICS haha

193
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,140
there's really not a lot out there and
that's kind of sad because this

194
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:12,089
technology has been around for a very
long time but nobody really like the

195
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:17,849
people who who grew up and we're working
with it have aged out of the industry or

196
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,919
are too expensive to bring in to fix how
many people here are still program in

197
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:30,330
cobol how many people here have a good
touch the as400 yeah if you look around

198
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:41,669
at the people who raised their hands
that are again and so like my generation

199
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,790
younger being secure professionals are
unfamiliar with his body of knowledge

200
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,230
they just assumed that oh well of course
it runs windows it's no problem

201
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:56,159
the hell's this you know doesn't even
have a GUI what it's all command line

202
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,140
are you kidding

203
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:07,500
and the obligatory yes this is what
happens when you try to scan ICS network

204
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:14,280
with t5 on in that bad bad things

205
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:23,639
thank you oh and so why is the square e
and I remember the Ukraine power attacks

206
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:31,890
yeah Sandro whole nice white paper on it
so summer 2013 15 coordinated cyber

207
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:37,440
attack with 225 about customers without
power forced to go to manual mode for

208
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,370
several hours

209
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,770
anybody here working power industry now
going to manual mode in today's power

210
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:50,280
industry is a bad thing we don't like
doing arm Russia's blade that

211
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,240
attribution is always the bug business
Russia categorically denies any

212
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,200
involvement right arm so start with
spearfishing

213
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:09,070
it required users to enable the macros
on pop up who surprised that they click

214
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:15,490
them anybody surprised that these people
click the link yeah good yeah our

215
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,020
command control establishment harvesting
lateral movement began they found vpns

216
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:26,470
into the network with default credits or
reuse credits from multiple people are

217
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:32,800
found engineering process servers on the
SCADA Network Leyland conserve this was

218
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:40,960
about a six-month long process that was
going on with this December in Ukraine

219
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,610
really good toasty time of the year for
this to go on right nobody winners not

220
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,010
bad in Ukraine all right

221
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:54,220
oh so they launched it so not only where
the substation is disconnected but the

222
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,940
attackers configure the UPS to fail at
the central office once the doctors

223
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,150
began so they shut off the power and
then they shut off the UPS so they

224
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:08,170
couldn't even begin to fix it kind of a
dick move in my opinion but not you know

225
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,020
these are the Russians right arm

226
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:16,930
they also installed malware into the
media converters that bricked the media

227
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:25,210
converters yeah they they pulled the
image from the media converters created

228
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:31,900
their own uploaded the new firmware to
the meteor converters then cause them

229
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,940
all to fail just as a little bit of salt
into the wound of what's going on here

230
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,810
00 and they did off the call center too
so that nobody could call and complain

231
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,980
about

232
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,960
so yeah Russians are sharks when it
comes to these things

233
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,640
ok so you're saying well Dan you know

234
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:57,310
come on that's Russia that's a
state-sponsored actor of course this is

235
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,760
going to be catastrophic if Russia gets
involved

236
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,760
nobody does that stuff here

237
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:11,179
if I remember this one and I read about
this one at all

238
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:17,000
yeah some so some hackers were you know
hacking about doing their thing and they

239
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:26,149
found and is 400 that was stored on a
front-end web server because that's a

240
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:31,549
good place to do that directly connected
into the internet and they're like all

241
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:34,399
whatever we can do with this

242
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:39,500
oh we can change the chemical mix that's
gone into the water plant we can change

243
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,870
the chlorine we can change whatever else
in here that causes the water to

244
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:52,489
essentially become undrinkable for this
entire city or mess with the lead levels

245
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:58,610
or are sick or any number of things that
are controlled in water that's release

246
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,610
that can take years to show up

247
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:11,360
yeah call arms so if you do this stuff
you know anybody does this stuff if

248
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,379
you're interested in even doing this
stuff please let us know this is

249
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:22,760
important things I usually have a slide
that I've gone around and maps all the

250
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,360
different chemical plants and water
treatment plants and wastewater

251
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,889
treatment plants and various things
probably within about 20 to 25 mile

252
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:38,510
radius of the hotel and then go to
Chopin and I take a picture of all the

253
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,990
stuff that's available on showdown for
these different types of places and then

254
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,309
I show that there's an open source
project for da mp3 that will actually

255
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:54,260
has exploits written into it so if you
can find the stuff that's on the

256
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,980
internet you can just pull this up like
metasploit run it and you're into the

257
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,350
system itself this stuff

258
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,730
out there it's scary this type of thing
will happen in the future as this

259
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,799
becomes easier and easier to get into
because we don't protect it we don't do

260
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:16,690
what we need to do in order to make sure
that these systems are secure and the

261
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:23,650
final plug call security con we could
help you fix this so my information

262
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:28,660
anybody's interested uh I think the
slides are going to be already posted on

263
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:36,130
here if not i usually post them i get
help better on our went then regroup for

264
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:41,380
Twitter and all my emails i said any
questions

265
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:57,159
well guess what

266
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:04,449
so it kind of depends on the environment
that you're going into are some more

267
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,940
robust than others but they six you know
port scanning type of thing and maps

268
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,039
good because you can really fine-tune it
down

269
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:16,390
oh there's a couple of Tennessee stuff
written for scada systems that you can

270
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:24,610
use as well uh Nessus a little bit me
but it you gotta be really careful with

271
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:28,270
the assistance because if you blast
traffic out like a lot of these stuff

272
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,010
have killed it kilobytes of memory
available and if you're in there used to

273
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,870
getting one or two packets here when two
packets there that look the same way

274
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,110
that have the same type of protocol
information if you start just spitting

275
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:45,158
random stuff that they essentially throw
your hands in the air and fall over so

276
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:47,020
arm

277
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:52,120
yeah i mean a lot of mostly open source
stuff you kind of just got a piecemeal

278
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,199
it with a map and things like that's why
it's kind of pain in the ass

279
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,740
originally to start off with because
you've just got to spend so much time

280
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,870
being careful initially on these systems
to you get a good view of the layout so

281
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,260
anybody else

282
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,149
yes sir

283
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:31,408
flying one was so the is the i want to
say it's a problem

284
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:37,830
the interesting things about these stuff
is that a lot of these systems can fall

285
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:43,769
under the physical security plan and
those people didn't didn't cut their

286
00:25:43,769 --> 00:25:47,940
teeth on networking security things like
that as far as they know they plug it in

287
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,879
and it works at the light flash eat it
okay you know type of thing where you

288
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:57,570
know we're trying to let they have like
business IT that handles all security

289
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:03,689
and stuff like that but the plant is
separate and getting that to kind of get

290
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,249
out of that mindset and put it in here
it's becoming easier just because of

291
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:12,629
like the news articles where it's like
the water plant was on the network on

292
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:17,309
the internet what are you doing type of
thing um so it's it's starting to

293
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:21,658
progress because these systems are
coming out of the woodwork especially

294
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:26,700
after like nine eleven all and like the
Ukraine attack where it's like oh my god

295
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,019
while we can really deal with this we
have to do that and a big motivators the

296
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:36,179
cyber insurance industry because if
you're not doing your due diligence you

297
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,359
don't get to file a claim they just deny
it because you didn't do your due

298
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:39,989
diligence

299
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:45,059
so now sadly the lawyers get involved
and then they start having to force the

300
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:49,259
issue on these types of things of you
need to do this you need to maintain

301
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:53,279
this the network diagrams actually have
to represent what the network looks like

302
00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:12,719
. what did 10 years ago so and it is
great

303
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,520
yes

304
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:23,230
where's everybody else kind of have
something over there

305
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:29,350
yes well in the the issue that we all
know here is that you can be compliant

306
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:35,199
but not secure and so you know with the
regulations and stuff they're going to

307
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,590
be constantly forced on people like here
for compliance

308
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:52,120
yes a good for that five yeah yeah yeah
yeah

309
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,120
what

310
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:01,239
well in the challenge for these types of
systems it's converting it into dollars

311
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:06,040
how much is this gonna cost me to do how
much is it gonna cost to bring somebody

312
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,690
in you can do this

313
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,820
how much is it going to cost in downtime
vs is it even worth that it isn't even

314
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,500
worth to pursue you know that we start
getting to like the cissp territory of

315
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
risk and all these other types of course

316
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:28,240
yeah but try to convince your CEO or are
your CFO that know we really should

317
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,470
spend a couple million securing this
network because the catastrophic failure

318
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:38,740
will result in the company going
bankrupt and then of course then you run

319
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,390
into the hyperbole all course it will
result in bankruptcy and then then it's

320
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,580
on you basically sit there and go

321
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,290
no really this this we violate this we
do this we could find this we do this

322
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:54,970
and you get for us to be able to again
break it down into dollars

323
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,470
this is the ultimate cost we all do it
this is what's going to happen

324
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:10,660
yes sir on my way out there

325
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:17,440
yellow one that but it in your right if
you're on a internal team but if you're

326
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,280
on an external team coming in there

327
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,960
okay yeah no I mean well but even then
you may not necessarily have buyer you

328
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,220
know I have a friend who works at
Oklahoma who makes this company makes

329
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:35,070
witches and he is part of a pci on it
and a regular send customers credit card

330
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,010
information back and forth no problem
when everything else like that he's

331
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:44,370
going what are you doing you can't do
this for violating pci well this is how

332
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,139
we've always done it this is how our
customers prefer i don't i don't care

333
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,680
this is this is wrong we can't do this

334
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,600
well what's the worst that can happen
same type of industry with this well

335
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,820
what's the worst that can happen

336
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:06,810
mushroom cloud over task louisiana by
the Mississippi River going down to the

337
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,340
port's silent with the dollar amount
without be but sounds bad

338
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:21,570
oh ok well here's your budget thing you
know the other questions guess

339
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,700
re always incredible values or
acceptance slow down you know I'm

340
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:34,950
thinking motivations non-state actors
multinationals II know Layla was texts

341
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:40,080
you know it was necessarily want to
shoot just now they want to learn

342
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:48,270
Russian again it depends on the industry
and it also depends on the utility or

343
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:52,050
productor being able to monitor that
stuff because a lot of these people are

344
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:57,510
like water logs you know and in going
back to Ukraine attack took place over

345
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:04,050
six months their Lord retention policy
was 90 days so after 90 days any of the

346
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:09,060
logging that would have led to this
information was gone well so then how do

347
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,280
you keep track of how long do you keep
your loss

348
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,389
who's going over the logs are you
looking for type of thing where with

349
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,530
these types of and because of the
protocols and systems that are involved

350
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,800
with her little cryptic to other people

351
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,620
your regular log monkey may not even
know what to look for and just sees all

352
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,469
the stuff comes up and it's like all
these are false positives he's always

353
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,570
happen I don't know what

354
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:39,049
long so it really is one of those areas
that if you know what you're looking for

355
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:40,639
of course you see what's going on

356
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:45,500
you don't know what you're looking for
you can fly right by it in terms of

357
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:53,419
expertise if you're talking about
scoring so the production company you

358
00:31:53,419 --> 00:32:02,029
need significant resources to understand
the label and yes and in terms not so

359
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:13,639
much the non-critical set portions are
there non-state actors who are throwing

360
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:20,059
resources into learning for in operation
so is it

361
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:24,409
I again a ball down the dollars big
thing right now is ransomware because

362
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,470
it's quick easy you can throw stuff out
there people pay you for it

363
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:35,870
I could easily see siemens and a very
much cutout hands-off type of approach

364
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:40,879
go after him touching because those are
two big major producers of these types

365
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:47,809
of equipment all I mean economic
espionage goes on constantly and for

366
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:52,970
these that type of system active area if
you can monetize it for those groups

367
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,809
it's kind of a low-hanging fruit
situation there much rather spend

368
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:01,039
resources on you know exploit kits
ransomware things like that either quick

369
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:07,610
unrepeatable it's more geared towards
nation-state stuffed with this type of

370
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,389
thing just because its power because its
water

371
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:21,169
yes and and so that it if it's more like
a cyber warfare is a turn but like you

372
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:24,379
know modern cyber warfare weapons we
don't necessarily need the atom bomb

373
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:29,149
carpet-bombing things like that if an
invasion forces coming in like with

374
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:33,350
Ukraine or cracking the Crimea or
something like that they execute they

375
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,789
shut off power shut off water shut off
everything else everything is paralyzed

376
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:40,908
and it's done it's kind of hard to
monetize

377
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:48,139
because you know exactly you know
especially when there are when there are

378
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:58,908
quicker and easier things to do to earn
the money as it wants so thank you all

379
00:33:58,909 --> 00:33:59,119
for coming
