2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:19,230
4pm alright glad you're here and we're
here to talk about stem it's kind of

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,750
interesting topic

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,180

of heel

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,440
I work for MobileIron thank you will

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,250
oh I wasn't there so yeah there's your
so we in the spirit of the political

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,619
kind of weather that we're in these days
we decided to have some kind of slogan

13
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,460
that we're going to be campaigning on
and my slogan is that we leave no child

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,908
email behind and we should give them all
their own server and i'm chris from

15
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,380
running with a you know this idea this
campaign for Stan makes them great again

16
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,340
you know I work for fire and I'm skater
guy

17
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,200
this is way out of my wheelhouse we're
talking about education here but I had a

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,650
really rip really really really funny
treat tweet

19
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,930
yeah so we're going to build a firewall
and ID is going to pay for it makes

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,390
skater great again

21
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:51,720
does the voices USB USB USB USB USB so
let's talk about stem a little bit a lot

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,869
of you people probably heard the term
ready you know in science technology

23
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,550
engineering and math that's a commonly
used term it's there's a lot of budget

24
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,670
money around this there's there's some
programs that are created to add

25
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,180
curriculum within everything from
elementary school that all the way up to

26
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,600
higher education and it's a really big
focus globally and if you kind of think

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,810
about it like when did this term come
about was back in nineteen ninety-seven

28
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,670
the national science foundation first
while kind of discussing on how do we

29
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,829
need to be more competitive with the
other education like for example I think

30
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,260
singapore was like one of the big
countries that we're trying to compete

31
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,690
with and and we needed to get that type
of knowledge into the the hands of the

32
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,370
younger people to have more careers
because we kept really outsourcing a lot

33
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,019
of it we still do today so became very
very popular during that teacher

34
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,650
education collaborated conference the
head so then in 2010

35
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,290
there's somebody came up with the term
of steam so they wanted to include art

36
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,730
in that and yeah that's great i love art
and there's a lot of people that do

37
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,869
hacking that our technical people that
do a lot of cool things with art and

38
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,610
even graphic design is very technical
but steam is also another one of the

39
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,900
terms that are out there and in fact in
2014 and Huffington Post somebody wrote

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,670
an article of well stem is great but we
need steam and stream so they lumped in

41
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,290
reading as well and the term just keeps
kind of blossoming one of the things

42
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,310
that when i was talking to chris about
this is how much more stem focused it

43
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,329
doesn't mean i don't believe art or
reading is important but you can't do

44
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:30,329
everything well you got to kind of pick
a few of these things

45
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,970
yeah well you need a hacker logos like
vulnerability logos you know

46
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,680
rami i know right he does so you know
the art part of it got to make those

47
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,450
funny logos to represent your
vulnerability account so but some stem

48
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,480
in the United States you know President
Obama has been

49
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,190
campaign about it for a while put a lot
of money towards it

50
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:59,510
he had this is really great quote it's
an approach to the world a critical way

51
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,609
to understand and explore and engage
with the world then have the capacity to

52
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,580
change that world what does that sound
line

53
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:14,690
mm jack the plaque the planet hack the
plan so we were talking in the back

54
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,548
channel you know I was so Google words
just shooting the shooting the breeze

55
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:22,669
and he can we start talking about us

56
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:28,969
stem and hacking in so where I love you
guys can read that but basically it's

57
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,860
like I've been going over your idea for
stem or stemware snowman or you know

58
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,570
that's interesting

59
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,630
if you have I can inject their where we
were trying to come up with an

60
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,130
interesting kind of acronym that would
pronounce would be uniquely recognizable

61
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,289
who were going to the iterations we came
up with Emmy THS we kind of decided we

62
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,289
didn't want to see hey kids Julia Mets
class today

63
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:59,690
Breaking Bad many myths so to Nellie so
he says should we call make this talk

64
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,830
make stem great again and I thought he
nailed it with that you know the

65
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:10,370
political thing back in March so that
that's so what's this so what's a stem

66
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,520
thing with this what he talkin about
Willis

67
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,310
we present to you science technology
engineering hacking and math

68
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:27,139
thank you right you're like a conference
whether you are a hacker that was no

69
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,669
self-anointed or anointed by a crew or
whether you're you're out there doing

70
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:38,479
ethical hacking or questionable hacking
with this concept is really for anyone

71
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,250
who embraces these concepts because when
you think of hacking don't like the

72
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,940
technology that we use there's a lot of
applied sciences but hacking is also an

73
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,870
application of any one of those other
four disciplines within stem so just

74
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,410
feels appropriate that we also included
within the acronym

75
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,850
we're going to have an overview of
reasons for including hacking in regular

76
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,220
stem programs hacking education groups
are emerging we're gonna go over several

77
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,710
of those groups and and organizations
and we've got some case studies where we

78
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:18,150
found examples of hacking education
especially for young kids and then we go

79
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:25,770
over some of the challenges that hacking
education faces so you know it starts

80
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,650
out as a hobby right hacking 30 years
ago right

81
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:35,400
yeah uh it was like a hobby he had you
know bulletin boards and modems and

82
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,729
maybe download the Anarchist Cookbook
off the BBS and then you know stuff like

83
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:47,220
that it wasn't really something that you
learned in school and even computers

84
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,560
back in school or not really there we
have the Apple to lab you know how you

85
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,630
know organ trail and then maybe the
hacking part of that was going to the

86
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,310
the voice emulator and typing in words
that it would make makes a bad word in

87
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,370
class you know the teacher we want those
not you know so you know it started as a

88
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,850
hobby and you have you know the
emergence of and no debt at DEFCON right

89
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,570
and there's just very few amount of
people there and just all around the

90
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:24,120
world and it's grown and grown and grown
and now we have now we have it's a pro

91
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,360
career it's you have a professional
career you know

92
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,810
Oh uncle Kevin now he's at the top of a
big company and in Dave Uncle Dave you

93
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,960
know he's got this look at me doesn't
look like a hacker it looks like

94
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,030
business accounting or something right

95
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,659
get out

96
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:49,750
right so it's one of those things where
it's going from a hobby to a real

97
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,270
professional and career and you're
starting to see college classes come out

98
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,140
or like my alma mater louisiana tech
they have a four-year engineering

99
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,550
hacking basically degree rolled up into
what they call cyber engineering degree

100
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:09,310
so it's starting to become pro getting
comments you know yet with about how you

101
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,970
started with the Anarchist Cookbook did
you try to make a go can you say

102
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,040
publicly if you try to make a pipe bomb

103
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:24,670
no I didn't he want a minute I start I
am when I was eight years old remember

104
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,810
when you had a television that was the
size of a piece of furniture in your

105
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,840
home and my mom probably in the kitchen
doing something I don't know where my

106
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,580
siblings and my dad was but i wanted to
know how those people that in the TV so

107
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,240
what do you think i didn't get one of my
dad's flathead screwdrivers started

108
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,890
taking the back off i did remember to
turn the TV off first but when I went to

109
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,680
go and grab one of those vacuum tubes
anything happened I burned myself

110
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,310
actually it was hot so I waited a little
bit still screwdriver in hand finally

111
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,530
holding out looked at it went

112
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:09,069
shit how does this go back in there
going to kill me so luckily i put it

113
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,090
back in

114
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,540
but there's the one thing I forgot to do

115
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,610
unplug the television so thinking back
to that time in that something I've

116
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,570
never forgotten because the burner that
I think myself electrocuted or in

117
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,530
trouble

118
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:28,290
it was be if there was a mentor somebody
who could show me the right way to do

119
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,209
something with electrical engineering or
you know whatever the top technology was

120
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:39,840
back then as I was a kid that would have
been a big difference in my life then

121
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,470
eventually progressing into school and
you know it's kind of cool you had an

122
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,130
apple was it to e/o that was it $OPERAND
years at our school

123
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,630
oh yeah my school had an IBM IBM punch
card machine that i had to sit there and

124
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,900
do the little charged with the paper and
sit on the machine and deal with Chad's

125
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,340
you guys had some high-tech stuff is
cool but then over time you know playing

126
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,890
ultima and barge tail and all these
other games really kind of move me into

127
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,240
understanding how systems work so that
we can you know add a little bit more

128
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,720
memory make the game but there was a
problem that this couldn't be read

129
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,550
remember when you had to like turn the
floppy to get the holes lined up or I'm

130
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:23,400
gonna make this disc you know read-only
now those fun things are put a sticker

131
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,480
on it or something

132
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,690
so all of those kind of little things
over time and getting on bulletin board

133
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,650
systems and then talking to people like
what is that Internet gateway and why is

134
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,630
it so expensive and things like that and
also you know pushed me forward but

135
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,780
right now it's a career

136
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,709
yeah so and now there's increased
emphasis in the media so that first one

137
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,940
on the left you

138
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,030
that's the tabloids and 2000 hackers can
turn your home computer into a bomb you

139
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:58,650
know how away if right and then one of
my friends is on fox news about when

140
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:04,920
they are Iranian hack they were trying
to get into these dams in New York and

141
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,599
you know it

142
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,080
when was hacking on fox news

143
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,670
no I did that one

144
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:20,010
yeah and then most recently you know now
we're getting a mr. robot and this one

145
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,870
awards and there is really becoming
mainstream it's really something else

146
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:31,140
that we've seen is social increased
awareness increase acceptance of someone

147
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,699
and it's really exciting one of the good
one of the concerns that we have and I

148
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,600
you may have it as well you know if you
look back historically with someone like

149
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,730
the hacker movies and the way they
portrayed certain things like a virus

150
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,690
eating away at the display and do silly
things like that we know that are not

151
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,400
real but when mr. robot comes around and
there are other really cool movies that

152
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,750
did a good job of portraying technology
as is but they still had to make it you

153
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,140
know consumable for the general
audiences that we watch it but we mr.

154
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,449
robot they're showing real tools and
things that are like um you know about

155
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:12,210
13 or some other kinds of fun like
things that we do during a CTF it gets

156
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,770
other people who don't quite understand
this interested in they go well i watch

157
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:21,449
mr. robot I'm a hacker and I'm going to
do the same things to put that away is a

158
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,930
good thing but it's also something to be
concerned about because they need to

159
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,979
learn the right way to do it you know
there's some gonna mention Russell a

160
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,640
cough he's an economist and he does talk
about the more you do something wrong

161
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,010
the wrong or you become but once you on
do something right wrong but you

162
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,240
actually start to do it

163
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,220
writer / Tommy so it's okay to make
mistakes like hackers do to get better

164
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,840
at what we do as long as we're doing it
the right way and mr. robots a great

165
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,750
example of getting people interested in
what we do

166
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,540
oh and work for sure

167
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,370
again there's a the CSO online article
that talked about the zero-percent of

168
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,560
cybersecurity unemployment 0% we know
that there are some people in

169
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,030
cybersecurity that are unemployed it's
it's not exactly a zero but there's

170
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,199
still a lot of jobs out there so it's
really a short duration part of the

171
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,100
reason why I kind of got out of
accounting and moved into IT and an

172
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,760
infosec because it's such a demand it
just recently with speak with a geek

173
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,360
they were in vegas during infotech
summer camp they interviewed a bunch of

174
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,480
people we recommend that you take maybe
a quick picture this will go to the

175
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,200
bitly video trying to answer that
question of how we're going to fill

176
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,290
these million positions very interesting
video worth it

177
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,430
so hacking in education

178
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:50,790
how many of you have kids ok children
are natural hackers right that's why all

179
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:56,670
the time why don't we do this one is
this was how houses but my some classic

180
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:03,599
well you know why is why is a door not
having the house doorknob made you know

181
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,980
you know I don't know it's look it up on
how its made on you know YouTube or

182
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,800
whatever and they always questioned
Authority so if I tell my kids know

183
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,290
they'll say well I don't like that I'm
gonna go talk to mom but they will not

184
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,010
tell me that or no go talk to mom about
something and try to you know and that

185
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:29,760
plays into their persistent right there
if they want something they're created

186
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,700
and they innovate like building a ladder
out of out of you know toys to build

187
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,290
gets a cookie at the top of the
refrigerator you know and their social

188
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:45,660
engineers would like to say they any
good said I can't do it but uh you know

189
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,280
my mom you know may say okay we can go
to or vice versa

190
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,410
you know they want to get what they want
have I got some more stories so like

191
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,510
social engineering you know they're your
kids while my oldest kid was calm / 0

192
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:05,340
comes up to me and says uh mom said I
can go and buy that

193
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,830
no that purchase inside a clash Royale
I'm sorry he asks me can I make that

194
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,430
purchase within clash Royale and of
course I already know how the games

195
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:20,790
played oh well what did your mom say he
says it's up to you she might have

196
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,209
already said no but happy to do a check
with the boss in charge

197
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,460
the other thing is they are innovative
right on this picture here is a young

198
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,050
lady to hack for kids our first one that
we did in 2014 and she's just taking

199
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,250
things apart and you can see you know
she's a girly girl but she also wants to

200
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,970
take the tech apart i've done a
soldering workshop with her when she was

201
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:47,430
soldering up a DC darknet badge and she
got burned and she didn't kind of call

202
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,349
it quits now might just be who she is
but she she's like oh ok i got burned

203
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,530
let's keep going and that was great
because she wanted to see the progress

204
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:02,160
of what she was building now when it
when it comes to the innovation same /

205
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,260
kid 0 so we grounded from screens we
need you know not doing the things you

206
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,740
supposed to do but when he's not
grounded like he might use my wife's

207
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,320
phone so she'll unlock it and he learned
which sold no shoulder surfing is okay

208
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,990
so she's like I'm gonna use touch ID

209
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,130
well one day when he's on her phone he's
like Oh mom I lock the phone by accident

210
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,360
can you please enter your pass code
again to unlock and she's like okay

211
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,700
types it in he actually registered his
thumbprint to touch ID so you can see

212
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,230
you grounded

213
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:40,710
how did you get on my phone at so very
innovative when there's the motivation

214
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,630
in the incentive to get what they want

215
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:48,689
yeah and you know kids when they're that
they love the mash buttons right you

216
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,240
have you seen this thing from seeing in
a five-year-old boy axes dad's xbox

217
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,730
account by entering a bunch of spaces
into the passcode and whenever he

218
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,680
endured a bunch of spaces and you have
to go pull this video it's terribly cute

219
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,870
but the kid he he puts all these spaces
in and hit enter and he jumps up yeah

220
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:18,959
and the day his dads in infosec somehow
he's like oh we gotta go report this and

221
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,980
they gave him credit microsoft access to
get the boy credit for finding that

222
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,149
vulnerability but just him being
persistent just him you know being

223
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:30,870
really curious and they've got a lot of
time at that age you know to focus on

224
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:39,928
you know those things and we got a
little video here the audio yeah 149

225
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:47,100
kill ok I 119 kill is it ok to share
your password people

226
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:55,949
I'm sorry what'd you say yeah yeah it's
okay to share best but with people he

227
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,870
was about to and at that time

228
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,479
that's / kid too he wasn't speaking too
much but he did learn how to pronounce

229
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,929
numbers he had the again the incentive
motivation to unlock the tablet so we

230
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:15,389
can play the video games and watch
videos on and kidney on youtube kids but

231
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:20,908
it took us a little more than a year for
him to want to have a new passcode but

232
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:26,009
what I love is the fact that now he's
like four and he has a new passcode he

233
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:30,600
doesn't share it with anybody but me not
even mom so that means that they can

234
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,070
learn because it isn't that he realized
it was important but it's still an

235
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,360
adorable video

236
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:43,918
yeah so my son he any of you ever heard
of the kano kit it's a little bit

237
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,419
different than a raspberry pi and they
put some really polished software and

238
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:54,179
it's really cool they have a lot of you
they got scratch and one of the things

239
00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:00,059
that you can do is you scratch to
program the game palm ball and a

240
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:07,200
Minecraft but in this example my son he
said well I can I can do this and so he

241
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
started putting this code together and
that's a screenshot of it

242
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,649
no there's only there's a little thing
there whenever the ball gets hit or the

243
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,270
panel gets hit it changes color and then
he tried to put as many nines as he

244
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,639
could inside the code and then he trying
to make the ball like grow infant I mean

245
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,720
like the ball was completely off the
screen big and he made it change colors

246
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,520
and he made it like makes sounds and its
really driving my mom crazy because what

247
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,550
are you doing in there is just making
all this racket and he's over there

248
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:44,940
giggling you know and you know he's he's
got this other you know this other part

249
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,770
where his makes this paddle as big as
the screen and makes the opponent's

250
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,240
shrink down to nothing and then but no
he's like he's like a little hacker so

251
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,200
you know he's gonna troll look at his
title so I mean something you probably

252
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,930
use that right you probably heard a
threat but so I mean I mean we're all

253
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:12,120
kids at heart still so that I mean
that's just one example of my son and so

254
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:19,620
just seeing what you can do with code
but but yeah exactly so kind of going

255
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,939
back to the education . actor kids was
created with there's a lot of

256
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,160
organizations out there aggregates was
not a unique idea who was def con kids

257
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,240
before became roots asylum and then had
kids in san jose and there's other

258
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,770
people in organizations have been doing
this for a long time but when we created

259
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,110
advocates back in 2014 the idea was to
get in front of these these kids who

260
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,060
were passionate about technology the way
we are we wanted them to learn how to do

261
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:52,020
it the right way even if they made
mistakes encourage mistakes and then you

262
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,440
know that term helicopter parents the
parents that are over their kids like

263
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,430
you know you're doing it wrong this is
so easy we tell them to back off

264
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:04,290
we have an area for them to sit they can
take out their laptop we want the kids

265
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:10,200
to learn in a very comfortable free kind
of environment there's a lot of reasons

266
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,530
in addition to this that we created hack
for kids but one story I have to tell

267
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:18,240
you is when I was trying to get / 20
interested in programming here and did

268
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,780
some scratch programming on his own he
didn't really know where else to go with

269
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,020
it so it was a young programmers meet up

270
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,860
that's like about a half hour so from
our house so let's go there and we met

271
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,479
and there's one other kid who was 12
years old and they started talking

272
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,770
together back then I think / 20 might
have been like eight so they're doing

273
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,930
their thing and talking his mom and this
the twelve-year-old name was Nick and

274
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:50,520
Aaron his parents have no education or
or work experience in technology i think

275
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,910
one of them was a history teacher and
one of the mighty math teacher so

276
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,180
there's a little bit of that crossover
like where did this come from

277
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:02,399
and in the he's sitting there writing
c++ code and she's like we have no idea

278
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,110
he wanted to learn how to code he a bit
of a reading disability in school so

279
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:14,459
when you're 19 I guess you're about
third grade or so and he wasn't reading

280
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,870
at the level that they were expecting
him to what he wanted to write code so

281
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,790
he taught himself how to read

282
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:26,370
he's one of those kinds of people who
just learned differently he taught

283
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:32,070
himself how to read to write C++ code
and he did it quite well and when I

284
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:36,600
asked him like oh you ever try python
and his response was so mature

285
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:44,969
it was well yeah I have but it's too
strict on indentation host gobsmacked

286
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,860
that was a twelve-year-old so what we
gotta do something to bring kids like

287
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,500
Nick together that have a lot in common
and can actually collaborate or share

288
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,940
ideas or whatever and that to me was
kinda like Fanning that flame and in

289
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,540
really kind of igniting it even further
but yeah there's a lot going on you can

290
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,480
talk about you interrupt you know the
cyber Patriot yeah how many people have

291
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,830
ever participate in that we've got a few
okay great i mean it's just a lot of

292
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,760
these different examples and they're
starting to pop up and that's that's a

293
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,720
good sign

294
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,580
so you've got this case study that will
talk about more story so we thought um

295
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:31,290
no no that's tinker that's the half the
kids mascot named by the tyros which we

296
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,800
call the kids if you're not familiar
with the term tyro it just means someone

297
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,250
is basically a student or learning

298
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,900
Padawan sounds pretty good but i think
that would have been some issues legal

299
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:47,600
different companies so we try to avoid
that term but Tyros are just just the

300
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,810
kids echo so i'm going to tell you a
little story about Bob we met bob was 14

301
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,700
at the time last year in indianapolis
when we did hack your kids there you

302
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,120
know he plays with computers and stop
video games and things like that at home

303
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,830
but when he came in him quick
orientation on what we had out and what

304
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:13,100
we're doing he went right to the crypto
corner and he he just never did it

305
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,270
before he didn't quite know what it was
about but we do for you is like decoding

306
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:22,520
binary base64 we have a rock 13 in there
we had some other symbols that was kind

307
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:30,200
of frequency analysis and Bob did not
want to leave from that spot we go to

308
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,650
lunch when we come back about an hour
later in $YEAR bob is standing outside

309
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:40,250
our door is it was long and he was
waiting he wanted to continue like to

310
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,120
have you ever done this before he's like
no but i love it and i had no idea that

311
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,580
this even existed so he stayed there and
he went through all the challenges and

312
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:53,810
that's kind of you know if that's
something that you can do try to expose

313
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:58,010
these young people or even if they're in
middle school high school to something

314
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,140
that they didn't know existed

315
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,540
that is a way that we can get people
more involved with stem with an h or

316
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:11,000
stand or however you want to say it
we've got a lot of crazy videos on but

317
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,330
um so Bob love crypto to Alice was a no
and and Bob went from Indianapolis to

318
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:25,040
Chicago we intentionally made more
challenges for him and he's been 24 hack

319
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,409
for kids which is pretty cool and we've
just added more things because we know

320
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,100
he loves it

321
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,240
another part of that story is you know
if you got kids and even if your friends

322
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,960
got kids or even less your nephews an
uncle or what-have-you if you're an

323
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,830
uncle when you and your kids come home
from something you know how was what you

324
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,860
do nothing

325
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:53,649
did you learn nothing alright good talk
in but in the end you know Bob did the

326
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,070
same thing with his dad but I wrote
Bob's dad an email and said by the way

327
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:03,070
he impressed us this is what he did this
is how long he did it

328
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,139
did you guys talk about this in dad
doing I had no idea he just said he had

329
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,120
fun you never said what he did

330
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,919
I'm gonna go nurture this and at that
point also for us that was kind of that

331
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,120
realization of what we were doing a
little further is we're teaching people

332
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,500
more about themselves that they didn't
know as well as people close to them

333
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:31,330
very very important so on to Alice so
Alice's on a ten-year-old I'm sorry

334
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,530
twelve-year-old girl I met in Detroit
this year and she had a bit of a rough

335
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,790
childhood

336
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:42,520
both parents were addicted different
kinds of chemicals and they just kind of

337
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,809
imagine how that can go in Detroit and
eventually she got into the foster

338
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:50,530
system where she lived for some time
until she was adopted later by some

339
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:55,418
people that worked in nineteen and and
they were very very patient with her

340
00:26:55,419 --> 00:27:00,309
just to kind of adjust to a different
lifestyle just things that I don't see

341
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:05,530
normal but would be expected for 12 year
old she never had she wasn't used to

342
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:11,649
being in a classroom things like that it
was very sad story but when she was very

343
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:17,440
comfortable her mom took a half the kids
in Detroit and she had an interest or

344
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,049
has an interest in technology but never
really did much more than maybe you know

345
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:30,040
using a browser so one what i thought
was really cool is things so that's the

346
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,610
first one

347
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,559
yeah so she's never really built legos
as assume about before so we assume

348
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:40,330
about competition and she had a great
time she built her bottom tested by you

349
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:47,139
did all the R&D and was battling her bot
and not only did she have a good time

350
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,400
and learned a lot and learned a lot
about herself she also placed first

351
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:57,809
so she got a nice $25 gift card which
considering her past

352
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:03,960
that's huge big difference so the other
things that we also did an online CTF so

353
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,619
she got into crypto so we had simple
encoding challenges as well as some

354
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,399
things that were a bit more advanced she
did the easiest encoding and she did the

355
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:16,289
hardest encoding she also then to the
information-gathering part which is

356
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:21,389
kinda like the intro to pentesting
what's the server's IP what web servers

357
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:25,320
running what are the dns servers basic
things that we know we can do and don't

358
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,279
even think twice

359
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:33,570
brand new to a lot of these kids she did
all of those completely swept the

360
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,830
lock-picking challenges so we had from
one to six pins and handcuffs she did

361
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:43,799
them all and then we even had on one of
our prototype badge right here so the

362
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:48,480
the tyros have their own white badge
which also had another encoded message

363
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,929
that was encoded in Braille that they
also have to figure out now

364
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:57,360
Alice's mom understanding that you know
it's easy to kind of give your kids the

365
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,229
answer if you want to do well and you
know this prizes at the end with this is

366
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:05,549
a term that we use it just you want
coaching or time we see that the tires

367
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:08,700
of stuff do you want me to give you a
hint

368
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,080
what do you want to spend more time
trying it on your home and in a lot of

369
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,189
times they want time but sometimes they
ask for some coaching and that's very

370
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,720
important because it feels like they're
still in control because they are but

371
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,320
then with the badge she was able to
figure that one out as well

372
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,600
and what's great is this is her first
technology event and she tied for first

373
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,600
place with the CTF so very very cool was
a great day for her because then she got

374
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,980
come to pick the you know the whatever
price she wanted and I think it was a

375
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,639
complicated which she's like now she's
got a Roman kind of little portable

376
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:47,070
computer which was actually pretty cool

377
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,809
Oh

378
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:53,908
so you know we we have the main event in
Chicago the kind of thinking a little

379
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:56,850
bit about had four kids and you might
want to bring somebody that you know

380
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:01,469
who's between the age of 17 17 we
started in Chicago but we partner with

381
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:07,110
other organizations like circle city con
which is Indianapolis rukon which is

382
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,490
Brussels and kind of really ghent so
this is our second year with them and

383
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:16,830
then also Kirk on which comprises about
half of that first row we were doing our

384
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,119
second year at work on which is also
pretty awesome at workshops and we're

385
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,610
doing something that we try to do
something different at all of them but

386
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,059
we kind of bring back some things that
we know the kids love like snap circuits

387
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:31,019
and taking tech apart we're doing a
crypto party so all the kids are going

388
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:35,009
to get their own key base account which
i think is actually pretty cool they

389
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:40,110
gave us a whole bunch of invites and
some colored balls but if you look at

390
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,110
the timeline the first year when we
start in 2014

391
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:48,570
we had 40 Tyros which first year event
no marketing all really worried about

392
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:54,240
we're pretty happy in 2015 across four
events we had a hundred and fifteen

393
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,570
Tyros participate and this year so far
we have 66 and we're projecting another

394
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:07,168
hundred between gerakan and we're doing
a partnership with sektor and b-sides

395
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:11,009
Toronto so we'll be there October
sixteenth in Toronto and the folks from

396
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:17,730
recon and october oh crap

397
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,300
already had one of these before

398
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:32,980
do we do we have to drink it now though
we're doing a talk about kids man at a

399
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,750
pc so for all the trolls out there let
us know you need to know this is a rule

400
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,300
of Der Beek on that if you've been iced

401
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,300
during your talk you have to drink

402
00:31:46,000 --> 00:32:04,870
music is so God the second one of the
day my laptop with high and brother

403
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:17,860
oh yeah i got class about this it is
smirnoff ice original the other was

404
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:27,340
tropical fruit wonderful i'm done with
this slide so one of the things that we

405
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:33,610
want to do is engage students and that
any of you ever taught any kind of class

406
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,820
sovereign-class or any kind of
programming class

407
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:42,340
yeah you have to keep your kids engaged
so you're being a mentor but you also

408
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:48,639
want the kids to be have a leadership
role so you put them in teams right and

409
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,350
sometimes some kids have pollution was
the ribbon paul writing gave a talk here

410
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:57,730
to your two years ago I mean he was
eight I think at the time that was

411
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:04,210
pretty awesome that's really good
leadership from a kid that really has of

412
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:09,940
passion for hacking you know when you
have to do like different activities

413
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,750
sick spanish skills and things ready
prior script of challenges we've talked

414
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:19,270
about that Piper kids in the the no
starch press they have a lot of books

415
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:24,100
for a degree kids books yeah so learning
program with my crap that's cool i mean

416
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:30,280
we just like this like programming with
leggins but you don't do the hertz rent

417
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:37,090
right and CTS um yeah I just want to
inject that so our dns servers down

418
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,959
right now but when it's back up you can
go down or director kids to CTF that

419
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,730
have four kids that organ that HK for
kiidz and we're going to have a lot of

420
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,920
the same challenges which the kids have
done at a conference would like to keep

421
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,590
them up and we do open people up we do
welcome people who are

422
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,399
online that are not at the events to
still do the challenges they're really

423
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,659
fun and you know if you're not at the
event unfortunately can't win a prize

424
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:06,289
we're trying to figure out a way that we
can do something or maybe you know for a

425
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:10,879
month will say okay go do the best you
can and then we can like ship something

426
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:17,449
off to somebody about incentives some of
the key to learning right learning is

427
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:23,598
important reading lots of reading right
but remember some kids really need that

428
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,899
hands-on that there's no real right way
that kids learning the site trying to

429
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:36,589
show people onto a standardized test and
make an elephant climate rewrite same

430
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:41,599
with same with kids wanting or even
adults to that at when the kids are

431
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,320
young and spongy mind they really pick
up things quickly and that's really

432
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,169
amazing to see they also need a
community what whether their community

433
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:56,779
of people in person or they have a
once-a-month meaning meet up with some

434
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,859
kind or maybe a slack channel for kids
don't even know if you can do that is

435
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:05,240
you i guess you could but i think you
know obviously being moderated your

436
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,160
language things i think that was a great
idea

437
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,118
yeah and then mentorship that is another
thing to show

438
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,359
hey of the old curmudgeons done this for
a long time

439
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:22,609
um what have you learned and what can we
learn from you and how can we teach the

440
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:30,410
new generation that's coming on to lead
the way forward as they get older they

441
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:36,319
grow into a mentorship role we find that
to be really cool when kids have gone to

442
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,250
a hack for kids a couple of times and
then someone else's knew whether they're

443
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:48,140
older younger there now kind of showing
them the roads that's a community so

444
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,420
somebody hit me up in social media this
year and said you know you guys work a

445
00:35:53,420 --> 00:36:00,380
lot with young people call you beat me
to going to beat you debating whether i

446
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,869
should just chuck it or keep talking

447
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:03,920
what do you think

448
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:14,270
jug it counts like sprite sprite maybe
it's been in the car like i was left in

449
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:23,390
the trunk in Arizona so somebody hit me
up on social media said you know what

450
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,770
you do something with some more senior
or junior high school students give them

451
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,250
an opportunity to go to DEFCON they were
really into it into one of those things

452
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,540
it's a cost factor just even get into
DEFCON as well as traveling out there

453
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,839
and thought about a little bit

454
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,099
some people even on social media felt
differently where it's not a good idea

455
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:47,329
to send kids death combat meanwhile
there's been defcon kids for several

456
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:51,829
years now but when things are done
properly it could be a positive

457
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:56,030
experience so we did the GoFundMe which
is the screenshot that you see here we

458
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,020
put together an application and and we
wanted to make sure with somebody who is

459
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:06,049
going to be going into iit-indore
infosec and really like not just

460
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:10,130
academically did well but show that they
did a lot of extracurricular activities

461
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,150
I don't know if you guys are familiar
with him so the Illinois math and

462
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:20,240
science academy we had three applicants
from there who were selected because

463
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,609
they're just not just into iit like some
were playing instruments and they were

464
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:29,270
leaders in clubs and started things like
that but one of the book that the

465
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,190
students that stood out the most

466
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:38,569
he was on a while he was an Eagle Scout
as in boy scouts he did the cyber

467
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:43,700
Patriot challenge for three years in row
and by the his third year he was captain

468
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,549
of the team and they took first place in
the Nationals and he didn't get first

469
00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:53,420
place in the Nationals until after he
was already selected was pretty amazing

470
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:58,309
to hear that later from his mom made us
feel like really good that we made

471
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,069
really good choices and selections on
who's going to go there to represent

472
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:06,619
themselves their parents their school's
their other organizations are a member

473
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,250
of a knack for kids

474
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,730
and right now they're finishing up some
papers that were going to make public

475
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,650
once we scrub some names for privacy
reasons but they had a really tremendous

476
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,770
experience you know they weren't there
to drink all the booze and a call the

477
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,340
things they were really like
participating in contests they're going

478
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,360
to talk i was checking in on them every
day what have you been doing everything

479
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,230
ok

480
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,110
and it turned out to be a really
positive experience for a lot of people

481
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:37,980
and we had an adult chaperone there to
anyone

482
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,900
wheeler so you're still here with us

483
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,720
that's great now we've also be that's ok
so we have some challenges that we want

484
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,980
to talk about hacking sometimes viewed
in a negative light still write and read

485
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:01,080
the comments and in the news stories
people really have a negative thing

486
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,630
about about it so that's one of things
we gotta overcome there's often a lack

487
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:12,660
of funding maker spaces are no hacks
places like Mississippi as far as i know

488
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:17,040
we don't have any makerspaces at all i
think our public libraries I think three

489
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,080
of them are just now getting a 3d
printer arm especially in rural areas so

490
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:29,250
my buddy chris sanders runs a real
technology fund so even just education .

491
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,800
in rural places as hard

492
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,080
some of those kids really take to you
know they have the internet they can

493
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:42,660
learn that way and they're really taken
to the idea and we got to reach those

494
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,509
kids too and that's one of the
challenges we have another challenge

495
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:51,510
that we have is very little metrics you
know our events how can we do to improve

496
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:58,020
you know you personally gotta measure
measure those things so we like to do we

497
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,780
start with paper surveys we moved to
survey monkey is a way to collect

498
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:07,530
information about overall experiences
but then there's the complexity of you

499
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,940
have one tyro they're doing something
they may have never done it before and

500
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,960
we like to just get very simple
information like did they completed or

501
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,510
not

502
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:21,940
like for example the lockpick village
and we have a spreadsheet with pins one

503
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:26,560
through six and handcuffs and we keep it
anonymous as possible to check a box if

504
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,970
this person sitting in that seat
completed these items and then we can

505
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,839
look at how many people went to that
activity how far they got

506
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,500
maybe they just pick the handcuff and
said I'm done and that's all they really

507
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,940
cared about and that's fine or even
Python for kids we try to do measurement

508
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:48,040
on just doing basic exercises challenges
we even threw in a Fibonacci series and

509
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,240
nobody was able to complete that is it
too hard for them or they just kind of

510
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,009
read it and said not for me

511
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:57,340
so these things are really really
complex because you never know when they

512
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,780
come back let's go back to Bob Bob
returns to another event we don't really

513
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:07,330
see his individual progress we're trying
to come up with a way to do that when

514
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,020
being online might be the best way to do
it because then we see when they start

515
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,259
an activity how long it took to
completion

516
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:20,470
if they stopped it and came back later
some kind of reward system so metrics

517
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:25,540
are difficult they're very complex
surveys are nice but you need more data

518
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:33,490
what's with based on you know what's you
know correlations and it's like they're

519
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,819
like in regular school the kids go to
school they have a standardized test and

520
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,300
we'd go

521
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,510
hey that's well known and maybe overdone

522
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:45,910
so we want to be able to measure how
they're learning how things trend you

523
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:50,980
know so hacking don't know if that's
ever been measured actually that's a

524
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,640
good that's a good question isn't
measured by how many books you published

525
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,720
or is it measured by how you impact the
community and move things forward

526
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:06,580
yeah exactly the crux of this is we need
you to us can talk about it and we can

527
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:12,580
invent a word stand them but we really
need you two to do it so some

528
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:18,970
conclusions we think hacking is exciting
and it's emerging hacking education is

529
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:26,049
emerging so it's still kind of new
really lasting impact for youth is great

530
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:26,980
because

531
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:32,020
a lot of us have really good jobs and
they're really exciting and we want our

532
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,350
kids to be able to have that opportunity
as well and there's so much opportunity

533
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:42,190
the value packing education called in
with regular stem and stream and all

534
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:48,760
that and I questioning attitude and say
how can how can I take this Internet of

535
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,930
Things thing and do something he wasn't
supposed to do and then maybe improve on

536
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,890
it and break it and improve on it again
make it more robust something like that

537
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:02,140
there's still so much more to do so we
have to have a theme song you know

538
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:08,920
instead of drinking all the ice that's
gonna guys

539
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,130
yeah drink all the cool laid-back all
things

540
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:26,109
oh yeah yeah yeah good so we're coming
into the talk we we want you to think

541
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:29,740
about this in your mind as you go back
home as you go back to your communities

542
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,930
as you go back to your kids

543
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:36,490
you probably already doing some of the
stuff is great so we want you to vote in

544
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:41,950
your mind vote with your actions as part
of our political campaign to introduce

545
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:49,868
hacking into education makes them great
again David Chris 2016 with the boat

546
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:55,030
stem and we try to still like with an h
or stand like you're clearing a drone

547
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,090
some other wait I think I am

548
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:05,170
yeah speech and the other one okay

549
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,279
no we've got some time for questions
think we've got about four minutes five

550
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,280
minutes question

551
00:44:13,060 --> 00:45:00,970
so that's an excellent point go back to
that slide with Obama and some of the

552
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:05,109
things that they've allocated funds and
I needed some research earlier was a

553
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:09,100
little bit late last year earlier this
year what grant programs are out there

554
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:15,130
and there's a lot of grant programs for
stem specifically is well as cyber

555
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:20,050
security related education so even if
you want to start a makerspace and you

556
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,490
make it like a 501c3 which hack for kids
is so got some experience dealing with

557
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:28,689
this and kind of understanding like the
ins and outs and that cute that key

558
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,810
phrase is also very important you're
absolutely right of social engineer the

559
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:38,980
game you know the the wording but a lot
of them also want an impact report they

560
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,950
want some kind of results are not just
going to give you money just because you

561
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:49,240
said you know this is what we're doing
we got any other questions that all

562
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,899
right well we appreciate you coming up
think about it and if you print one

563
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,030
suggestion is one thing you can do is if
your state doesn't have a computer

564
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:04,000
sciences of course science then you know
it works and like like Mississippi

565
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
that's that's a problem so maybe we can
start doing things like that to USB USB

566
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,820
USB you expect

567
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,210
good
