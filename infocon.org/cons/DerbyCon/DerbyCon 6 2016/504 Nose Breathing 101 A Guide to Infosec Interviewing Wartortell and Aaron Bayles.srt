1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,380
now that's not an option if thats tape
down

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,110
perfect alright well after all of those
backups let's go ahead

3
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:18,369
uh-huh so today we're going to talk
about interviewing let's go ahead and

4
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:23,740
get started so you uh might be asking
yourself who are these guys why can they

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,599
tell us anything about interviewing an
infosec i'm richard hotel or war tell

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,870
this is me i run a reverse engineering
team for palo alto networks june of last

7
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:40,659
year we were just me and now we're more
than 20 people so we've done a ton of

8
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,649
hiring the last year and we've had
absolutely no attrition and we have a

9
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:49,329
lot of very very good people so I feel
like we have some it a good insight into

10
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:57,699
actually hiring an infosec and this is
my final form if i ever get there so my

11
00:00:57,699 --> 00:00:59,769
name's Aaron or and Alex broken

12
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:03,850
I've been doing it was sick for about 20
years what's interesting is 2015 was the

13
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,890
first year in 20 years I was out of a
job was out of a job twice and 2015 and

14
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,990
so I ended up going through 11

15
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,970
corporal interview with 11 companies in
five weeks so I went through a lot of

16
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:22,179
this from the interviewee side and lots
of bad mistakes lots of good things and

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,270
so just kinda wanted to kind of
counterpoint what war tales talking

18
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:33,640
about from the interviewee side so um so
what's the point of the stock why are we

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,690
doing this we've seen a lot of poorly
handled interviews from my sight I've

20
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,530
seen a ton of really people not doing
any preparation in the interview process

21
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,490
not actually thinking about what they
want to interview for just like I will

22
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,580
interview them all asking some questions
that will be fine doesn't really work

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,179
out

24
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,800
we've also learned a lot from you know
all of alex's experiences recently with

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,789
all of the interviews he's gone through
so we wanted to provide some insight and

26
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,479
then on top of that right now infosec is
that kind of in a transition period a

27
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,020
little bit our art field is somewhat
normalizing there's actually a lot of

28
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,788
people on the market for once it's not a
market where you can just walk in and be

29
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:13,869
like I action give me a job and they'll
be like sure tired that's great

30
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,629
it's not exactly how it is anymore you
actually have to work with this you'll

31
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:20,679
have competition so we wanted to give
some insight and give you some better

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,440
things better ways to go about
interviewing also just some preparation

33
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,000
I decided that this talk is going to
have inspirational photos so get ready

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,980
yeah

35
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,390
so starting off up your first step is
getting your resume getting who you are

36
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,548
to the right person as you said we're
kind of in in like a tipping point now

37
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:46,870
there are actually our competition for
the job that you want you're not just

38
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,349
going to be able to say I've done this
for 10 years ago great have a job

39
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:53,649
there's going to be five of you with 10
years of experience all going for the

40
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,650
same time so you're going to have to
stand out you're going to have to show

41
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,780
them that you know what you know not
just from a good resume also we talk

42
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,440
about your like resources and your
resume don't just think of that word

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,450
document that you update twice a year

44
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,470
think about your github think about your
stack overflow chances are active in the

45
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,760
community you're doing more things than
just keeping a resume up-to-date so link

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,480
those in there they need to be part of
the whole of who you are because you're

47
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,560
going to have to stand out amongst these
other five or ten people going for the

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,870
same job so we're all smart people we
try to be smart people

49
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,620
one of things that you don't want to do
is when you go into looking for a job

50
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,139
you identify either the company the job
the industry like you know the area do

51
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,450
your research do your recon on it

52
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,530
look up its publicly traded company look
at their sec filings find out if they've

53
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,650
been making money if they've been losing
money probably not going to be a good

54
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,220
choice for a high-paid information
security job if they're privately held

55
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,060
company

56
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,239
look at look at their investors are see
what they're doing

57
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,660
look online cialis of get all
information that you can that's really

58
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,230
available so when you do go into the
interview you can actually ask them

59
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,160
intelligent questions about that which
kind of raises your capital as as an

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,579
interviewee saying hey this person
actually gets we're talking about they

61
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,579
know a little bit about who we are

62
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,079
so let's talk about the order of
operations here there is a right and a

63
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,420
wrong way to get a job

64
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,230
this was me in December of $MONTH 2015
this was two weeks before Christmas when

65
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:29,440
I got my last job failure notice thing
so I went out and I scattershot at the

66
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,710
entire world with resumes and
applications because I was desperate for

67
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,640
a job and so all this is going to do
while at work for Alex Rogan in the

68
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,430
movies it's not going to work for you
you're going to spend all your energy

69
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,490
and time you're going to feel like crap
from all the rejection you're going to

70
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,900
get going after the wrong jobs in the
wrong way so don't do this

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,690
your friends your friends should be your
first line of contact when you want a

72
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,840
new job your friends are going to be
either working in the field that you

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,380
want to the job that you want to the
company that you want to talk to them

74
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,180
first find out what the job looks like
what the company looks like maybe you've

75
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,120
got a false impression of it or maybe
you don't know how awesome that company

76
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,190
actually is so talk to your friends give
them your resume a lot of people myself

77
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,740
included had this idea of if i give
somebody my resume that I'm like owing

78
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,430
them something for this because you know
they're representing you and in a way

79
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,180
there is kinda like a friendship thing
there but here's the key thing if your

80
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,900
friend put in your resume and you get
hired from at your friends probably

81
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,070
going to get a check from their company
for bringing in a referral so lots of

82
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,390
companies do this

83
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,050
don't feel bad about using your friends
as long as they're cool with it to to

84
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,210
put your resume out there use your
friends they know people so next step

85
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,200
twitter if you're an information
security you really should be aware of

86
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,030
what's going on in Twitter companies are
always posting about jobs needs

87
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,820
struggles clients things like that

88
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,849
probably more than they should in some
cases but use that information

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,900
look up specific hashtag for the company
that you're going for look at the

90
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,130
different roles in the area i actually
ended up getting the job that I am right

91
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,669
now thanks to a connection that was a
lot of it was through Twitter somebody

92
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,090
that i had known on Twitter for a while
didn't realize the company that they

93
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,130
worked at was hiring and so just working
your connections again friends Twitter

94
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,080
really close together they're gonna
they're gonna pay off for you

95
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,810
so ninja jobs job boards that are
specifically focused to information

96
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,590
security jobs exist and are
proliferating the cool thing about these

97
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,849
things is it

98
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:35,819
they don't just let anybody with a
credit card post jobs there they

99
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:40,020
actually do vet the jobs and vet the
opportunities so that you know that

100
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,628
whenever you're going to these sites
they're more if there were more

101
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:47,310
reputable than you know your then like
your monster your your diet things like

102
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,900
that so you look at these look at the
specific jobs and and look for you know

103
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,878
focus in on you again but we're kind of
going from the most desirable to the

104
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,560
least but this is definitely will get
away up there and on that note this is

105
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,849
rob this is moving he's been doing a
really cool thing at conferences for the

106
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:09,719
last couple years is he'll actually put
a call out for companies to put together

107
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:15,120

want to interview you and talk to you at

108

the flare we go yeah we're all together

114
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,490
now we're all awake so there are a lot
of obviously puns of stuff on reddit for

115
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,500
specifically information security jobs
industry regions things like that it's a

116
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,729
source of information and you can get
bored there's lots of really cool cat

for jobs as well so this is a great

123
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,330
environment to show up to and talk to
people but not just this con think about

124
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:36,329
local it local things like user groups
or brown bags or meet ups or birds of a

125
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,460
feather meetups where you live

126
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,960
it doesn't have to be infosec I've
gotten great connections with people

127
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,330
from programming conferences from like I
said linux user group security user

128
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,720
group so don't just limit yourself to
thinking well I've got to go to dirty

129
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,070
your hush for defcon or girl Conor
whatever anything where like-minded

130
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,510

getting your name out there talking to

131
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,100
people and hey have a resume with you
have it have it handy ready to go for

132
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,080
you on that you know and then once you
actually window down you go from your

133
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,670
friends Twitter the job boards to read
it now you've actually got the job you

134
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,990
want to go for ready in hand you've got
your resume primed all your github of

135
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,050

cool stuff that makes you the unique

136

snowflake that you really are is ready
to go out there

137
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:30,180
however just be wary you're going to
apply for a job and sometimes this is

138
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,770
going to be the person that receives it

139
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,370
so give them a break they've got a lot
of things to go through so make sure

140
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,360
that within a reasonable amount of time
maybe within a week or so follow up

141
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,510
don't be the pushy every two hours
what's the word what's the word kind of

142
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,930
thing but also don't let it fall by
because you want to make sure that this

143
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,890
guy wakes up at some point to process
your application so my head over to

144
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,000
Richard

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,690
so next on the other side of things as a
company we do these we need to use the

146
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,700
exact same order of operations we need
to go and use referrals first that's the

147
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,600
first I put this in there because that's
all i could think that guy was thinking

148
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,820
we use our friends first like referrals
are your best source of finding new

149
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,410
people my whole team every single one of
the people on there has been by referral

150
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,550
we haven't had to source anybody we've
just gone through friends and found very

151
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,609
very good people on top after that going
to Twitter going to job boards that that

152
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,400
needs to be the exact same order of
operations because that's how you're

153
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,800
going to get good people up so let's
talk about how you present yourself and

154
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,920
what you're going to do when you
actually go for this job and you're

155
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,819
putting your resume together you have to
think about the image that you're

156
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,930
presenting in the information that
you're presenting so this is brad Brad

157
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,500
super-excited friends very proud he's
done a lot of things and he really wants

158
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,630
to tell you about him because Brad cissp
and he's super proud because that's a

159
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:01,200
really hard certain you should be super
proud of it and he's a CH and g CIA and

160
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,250
a derpy anagram and all in a new pattern
flurbin butts he he's got all of these

161
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,860
certs and he has a listed right on his
resume because he's God that he thinks

162
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,140
it there just the best things ever

163
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,850
the problem is Brad's interviewing with
this guy this dude doesn't give any

164
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,750
shits about any of those certs this guy
wants to hear about what you broke it

165
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,020
into vague descriptions of the
engagements that you've done things like

166
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,329
that he doesn't care about certs however
so then brad has a sad because Brad

167
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,070
doesn't get his job and he's really sad

168
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,150
however Brad's interviewing with this
dude this dude love certs because this

169
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,300
is a gumby bro and heavy bros love
search because they have boxes they have

170
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,680
to check now I know I'm renting a little
bit but this isn't really me saying

171
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,910
search or bad or good

172
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,569
the point is you need to play to your
audience here the puter the company that

173
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,780
you're trying to get a job at dependent
on that company they're going to be

174
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,410
looking at different things on your
resume so make sure that you are playing

175
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,370
towards that you have to understand
certain companies will love certain

176
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,600
companies will love

177
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,389
descriptions of project certain
companies will love descriptions of

178
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:09,779
engagements you have to play towards
what you're going for

179
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:16,139
if you have a very academic looking at
resume that's not going to play well for

180
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,839
like a red team or something like that
you have to think about these things

181
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,819
before you put that together so I want
to talk a little bit about recruiting

182
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:28,259
just quickly i'm just recruiting is
their recruiters in general or slightly

183
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,279
a double-edged sword there's basically
two kinds of recruiters i'm generalizing

184
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,839
but deal with it

185
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,250
there's internal recruiters and external
recruiters so the problem with external

186
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,850
recruiters that you deal with is that
every if you have like a recruiting

187
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,660
agency handling the sourcing for you
every person that they find they're

188
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,269
gonna be like this dude hot shit you
should hire him

189
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:53,459
it's amazing hiring immediately and the
problem is it's not always true in fact

190
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,410
the majority of the time it's not true

191
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,769
the reason this happens is recruiters
that are external are paid on Commission

192
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,579
usually the way they work is they get a
percentage of the first year salary of

193
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,569
the person that they place and because
of that they want to place as many

194
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:09,750
people as fast as possible and it
doesn't really matter if they're the

195
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,980
best I mean obviously they'll get used
more if they've source good people but

196
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,139
that doesn't seem to be how they work

197
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,949
so that's what you get with external
recruiters with internal recruiters are

198
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:24,389
not paid on Commission so they're not
and they're not necessarily security

199
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,939
people they don't net know what you're
looking for

200
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:31,050
so with internal recruiters they don't
know how to source the people a lot of

201
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,819
the time that you're really looking for

202
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:36,660
so when you're dealing with recruiters
the best advice I can give you is put

203
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,980
together all of the information that you
need to see on a resume or that you

204
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,910
would be interested for me I'm looking
for reverse engineers and people to do

205
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,079
our analysis so I have keywords that are
very important like I want to see get

206
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,859
hub i want to see idea pro I want to see
see in Python like these are the things

207
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,720
that I need in order for somebody to
succeed on my team you put together that

208
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,319
list so that that recruiter can succeed
in terms of what they give you

209
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,650
so now let's talk about actually putting
together an interview preparation for

210
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,189
another interview is the biggest failure
that i see in the whole process

211
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,880
nobody wants to actually do any prep
work and i understand that it takes a

212
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,910
little bit of time but if you put in a
little bit of effort you're going to get

213
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,100
better results if you think about
exactly how to interview and the

214
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,930
different steps and kind of what what
you really want to get out of it you can

215
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,219
put together a little bit of a plan so
the way that I go about it is we do a

216
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,090
phone screen essentially meeting at
doing a little bit of tech questions and

217
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,180
a little bit of culture questions just
to see if I'd want to work with this

218
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,689
person and if I think they're smart like
that's essentially what a phone screen

219
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,690
is it's the weed out anybody that I'm
like at don't want to work with this

220
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,100
person after that you'll set up a series
of other interviews

221
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,670
those are usually more heavy technical
I'm with the cross-section of skills

222
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,819
that you want to cover so a different
interview for you maybe each skill you

223
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,480
want to cover i usually do a programming
interview a reversing interview and like

224
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,900
a malware not college interview and then
you know you maybe have something that's

225
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,290
like a big picture interview like you
have a vp e or whatever is in your

226
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,740
company do something where they talk to
you about like the company and where

227
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,460
you're going

228
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,280
mainly kind of like the sales pitch
interview where you like you want to

229
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,180
work here that kind of thing if you put
together a little bit of a plan there

230
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,329
and give each interviewer a goal of like
what we need to get out of this

231
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:28,620
interview you get better results now so
let's talk about the intro this is

232
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,550
another place i see a lot of failures
and interviews just the introduction of

233
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,780
the interview like when you call up
somebody and it to interview them

234
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,760
calling them saying hey I'm Richard for
palo alto networks tell me about TCP it

235
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,170
doesn't really work very well it makes
it really impersonal and kind of elite

236
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,890
you kind of come off as aloof you want
to actually have a discussion with a

237
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,790
person the best interview I've ever had
have been discussions like it was just a

238
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,900
conversation where after it was over as
i go in our past that was awesome

239
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,579
that's kind of what you want to go for
so have a conversation when I when I

240
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,000
screen somebody I tell them my
background and where I'm coming from and

241
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,540
why I got into security so that they
understand that i'm excited about this

242
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,260
stuff and why I do this and then I asked
them to do the same i've read their

243
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,529
resume obviously but ice

244
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:18,769
want to hear them say it because it will
tell me something about them and then

245
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,879
you'll go into actual city tech
questions and different things like that

246
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,860
so you also want to ask questions when
you're asking tech questions or general

247
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,410
questions that are about creativity and
how people will handle situations don't

248
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,819
ask straight knowledge-based questions
like people can memorize things and it's

249
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:41,599
pretty useless to you if you have
somebody that just memorize things what

250
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,259
you need to ask questions where you find
out if somebody can handle a situation

251
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:50,180
that they're going to be thrown into the
job that they're going to do so I like

252
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,819
to ask some ridiculous questions that
are more

253
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:56,329
hey if I ask you something weird that
you probably never thought of how can

254
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:57,410
you handle it

255
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:04,939
I'm so I'm being told five minutes and
i'm gonna ignore him so I like to ask i

256
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:08,419
stole this question from fuzzy knob
actually I ask a question that's name

257
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:10,250
ten things that you can do with a brick

258
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,299
it's a stupid question but name ten
things it's really hard actually because

259
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,770
it's you think I build something at the
wrong answer is I build something i

260
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,480
don't know anything else they the right
answer is basically anything else

261
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,079
one of my favorite answers to this was i
eat it it's like I would have never

262
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,470
thought to say that that's pretty
awesome i've also heard i grind it down

263
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,419
and use it as ninja dust like that's a
cool answer i like that so just like if

264
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:38,990
somebody will will come up with stupid
things to do it throw it break something

265
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,679
like stupid things how they handle a
situation like that can tell you

266
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:47,240
something about them so next we have to
talk about tech questions obviously i'm

267
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,320
going to cover some possibilities for
good and bad questions i'm going to

268
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,559
cover Blue Team Red Team and pen testing
if you want to hear some good and bad

269
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,580
questions for other sources curve for
other fields

270
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,850
I'm happy to talk afterwards because we
can cover everything that we wanted to

271
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:07,250
cover we also i'm not above bribery I
have some coins from the labyrinth CTF

272
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,140
that just finished so first person to
yell scream or put up their hand now not

273
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:19,309
yet of the one that I think is the best
is allen key going Aaron is going to run

274
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,120
and grant and handy one of these so
first we'll start with blue team

275
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,399
what's the best one of these pros and
cons of these different vendors have you

276
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,090
written to improve

277
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:32,899
detective for your company describe your
ideal security product solution with

278
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,070
infinite budget

279
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:43,370
this man says to I heard three from you
that I like that answer but that man

280
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,540
already has a coin

281
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,530
I'm gonna give it a unitary bit number
three is actually my favorite one here

282
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:54,530
so the first one naming it pros and cons
of different vendors is not necessarily

283
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,770
the best question because they may not
have used them the better question would

284
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,280
be

285
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,240
hey I'm describe your favorite security
vendor or like vendor that you used and

286
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,870
what they like what they've added and
what why you use them and why it was

287
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,310
beneficial what have you written to
improve detection that can be good but

288
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,540
not all blue team people are coders so
it might not necessarily fit for the

289
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,770
person that you're interviewing the last
one it gets you some creativity get

290
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,270
allow somebody to ramble everybody
that's probably used some product like

291
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,900
alto networks or whatever probably has
been like this bullshit i would do this

292
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,070
differently of you probably have thought
about these things in reversing now

293
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,220
where I look at my where i'm like i
think i would do this differently if I

294
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,780
was evil you so asking them to tell you
about that it's a good thing ask him to

295
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:44,450
give you some information about how they
would design something so red team ideal

296
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,080
malware for long-term engagement social
engineer me to give you my phone number

297
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,350
right now in this environment which
phone would you use

298
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:57,560
I heard two from this man immediately no
I i saw the hand back there and he said

299
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:08,120
three and no Batman alright order of
operations but yes so in number one is I

300
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,889
i like because your ideal malware it's
the question i discard just described

301
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,820
you thought about this probably is as
you're renting like what he what would

302
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,560
you write in order to you know get into
it get into an environment persist and

303
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,550
not be detected

304
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,030
that's something that's important to red
teamers a lot of the time social

305
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,180
engineer me to give you my phone number
right now I disagree with that one

306
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,990
because you're putting somebody on the
spot and it might that can be great but

307
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,380
you can also come off as a dick for push
putting somebody on the spot like that

308
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,410
it's kinda there's pros and cons to that
one

309
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,710
and then in this specific environment
what Vaughn would you use

310
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,450
that's a very specific knowledge
question better things are like tell me

311
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,990
about your favorite moment why it's cool
like something like that where you're

312
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,590
getting somebody to tell you about
something interesting if they tell you

313
00:20:54,590 --> 00:21:02,030
about the most basic phone you're
learning something from it and then at

314
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,190
who said it

315
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:12,710
alright giving coin so for pentesting
metasploit commands pentesting a Bitcoin

316
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,370
exchange and then lists these things
similar stuff

317
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:21,110
metasploit commands for crafting a PDF
is very specific knowledge may not know

318
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,620
it

319
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,610
pentesting a Bitcoin exchange it's
interesting they can think about it and

320
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,100
probably give you some ideas they
probably thought about these things

321
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,790
before and then the last one is very
specific knowledge i don't even know how

322
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,980
to answer that that's a dumb question

323
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,450
I'm and then lastly with interviewing
you want to make sure that you're not

324
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,960
repeating yourself so make sure that
there's no repetition and overlap in

325
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,840
your interviewers they need to come in
with the list of questions that they

326
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,129
want to ask and they need to not be the
same as the last person that interview

327
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,880
you make that makes you look dumb in
general and you're not getting any extra

328
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,670
knowledge so make sure that your
interviewers go in with separate

329
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,750
questions and even separate goals of
like what they want to learn about this

330
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:06,920
person's knowledge to repeat avoid
repetition whenever possible benefit so

331
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,670
to conclude don't get past fail
questions don't ask like straight

332
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,900
knowledgebase questions don't ask
dictionary info questions like you want

333
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,380
to ask creativity or like figure out how
but how somebody thinks you're going to

334
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,650
get a better idea of how somebody's
gonna work at a job if you ask those

335
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,070
kind of questions and then make sure not
to repeat make sure not to repeat

336
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,860
yeah it so I'm on the other side of
things let's talk about the people that

337
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:36,860
are being like red flags that can happen
in every so um this guy this guy doesn't

338
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,770
get a job if you walk in interview again

339
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,940
Cooley aye honestly got the response
when i asked so why are you interested

340
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,920
in palo alto networks the guy responded
with a decent job decent wages and I was

341
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,990
like no like didn't want to talk to him
whatsoever

342
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,080
you need to come off as passionate like
this is stuff that interests you

343
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,360
so when and also when you're coming in
as an interviewee and the person across

344
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,530
the desk from you props his feet up with
his funky cool disco socks and his

345
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,280
outfit everything else he's hitting his
like vape and that's the size of his arm

346
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,490
while you're answering questions he
doesn't care

347
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,570
all he cares about is how cool he looks
how much hot shit he is and he wants you

348
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:21,379
to know how awesome he is that's not the
kind of company or the kind of person

349
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,640
you want to work with so at that point
if this is all about that person is

350
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,840
really cool socks

351
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,740
you probably should just walk away save
your energy for the next one you want

352
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:36,020
passion on both sides into of the table
for the work essentially that this last

353
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,770
one also came from a guy that I
interviewed with earth that a friend of

354
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,540
mine interviewed and his interviewer
came in in boardshorts barefoot put his

355
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,740
feet up on the desk

356
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,820
it started hitting his paper and talking
about himself like it doesn't come off

357
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:55,100
very good this guy also doesn't get a
job it's okay to say you don't know

358
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,939
something i would much rather say have
you say I don't know then

359
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,290
oh yeah I know I know this and then just
like try to come up with an answer

360
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:08,629
that's wrong it's totally fine to say
you don't know saying the coming up with

361
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,020
an answer will come off as like in a
work situation if you don't know

362
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,780
something you're going to try to lie
your way through it and that's not

363
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,950
somebody that I want to work with so
just be okay with not knowing some if

364
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,030
you know everything

365
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,020
also don't be this guy be humble about
it nobody wants to work with that dick

366
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,850
that like knows everything and really
wants to tell you it so this is probably

367
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,439
my favorite one from my interviews was
going to interview and the guys that can

368
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,040
ask you a personal question I was like
yeah sure you know keep it you know my

369
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,300
pg-13 or whatever but

370
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,260
so is it so we asked me what kind of get
do you play games like every video games

371
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,520
do what kind of games equal acid-like
co-op like Halo and Gears war he's like

372
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,690
what about call DSS wrong i'm not really
a fan I'm not the big pvp guys like

373
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,740
lovely quality and he's like you know I
find Carly to be a really you know at

374
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,810
you know a relationship between infosec
and what's going on so I'm really you

375
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,679
know it's kind of me or not they call
duty and so I'm like okay whoa man when

376
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,490
you get adversarial with the person in
the interview again kind of a red flag

377
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,080
also this is the same person that told
me with respect to the infrastructure

378
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,370
pentesting he goes you know you don't
see windows 98 boxes connect to the

379
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,939
internet anymore without a firewall
running remote desktop services mean

380
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,590
that is a literal word for word quote so
at that point I was like a i'm not going

381
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,490
to get this job no way in hell and be
probably really don't want to work with

382
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,870
this guy because he and I are just going
to boil in water so definitely great red

383
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:38,570
flag for me to walk away from and also
never respond to a question with this

384
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,230
don't say you can google something I
specifically asked questions that i know

385
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,980
that you can't google because I don't
want to hear this it's useless to me I

386
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,420
don't ask like straight information
questions if you say this it's never an

387
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,900
appropriate answer because obviously we
all have google we all have

388
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,140
stackoverflow we all have these things
but i want to know what you know off the

389
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,730
top of your head you never respond with
this you come off as you know it kind of

390
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,060
comes off as like a fuck you like that's
kind of how it sounds anytime that you

391
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:10,070
say that I'm sorry to the small child in
the front row fit it's just noticed that

392
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:15,530
and I feel like an outcast again 50 that
I know she's here right

393
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:22,040
finally it it probably here in the last
half hour

394
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,220
boom so the last that last red flag come
with questions always be prepared to ask

395
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,210
questions in an interview the worst
thing to do is in your first interview

396
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,330
with somebody coming and saying oh yeah
I don't have any questions you should

397
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,780
have a long list of things that you want
to know about working at this place it's

398
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,440
important to come in with that

399
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,510
and then finally be yourself like you
have to you have to want to work with

400
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,450
the people that are interviewing you and
you they need to want to work with you

401
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,660
as well so if you're filtering yourself
down to nothing

402
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,110
it's not gonna work out in six months
when they figure out that you're freakin

403
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,070
weirdo because we're all a little bit
autistic in this field so it's okay to

404
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,620
be yourself a little bit because you
want to figure out if the relationship

405
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,610
and the culture fit is going to be good
if you're this guy you probably don't

406
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,189
want to work with w bros it's not gonna
work out

407
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:14,430
and with that we will take any questions
that you guys have a good fit for that

408
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:21,120
this is cost better take a coin back if
it

409
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:28,290
yeah you were how do you work through a
question someone who doesn't like no

410
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:28,590
other

411
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:33,720
yes I i tend to if they don't know where
to begin whatsoever i'll try to give

412
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,320
some leading answers or two like lead
them to something where they might be a

413
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,429
little bit more comfortable and if it's
still just a complete missed then i will

414
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,060
probably move on to something else i
mean i usually have twice as twice the

415
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,260
number of questions that i can ask in an
interview ready to ask so that in that

416
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,490
scenario you this isn't your field
that's fine you don't know this we move

417
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,420
on to something that you may know
because I wanted if I get nothing from

418
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,450
the interview I don't know that I don't
know this i don't know then I'm it's

419
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,870
useless to me you might be great and I
just asked you the wrong question

420
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:12,060
so I just move on to something that you
might now this one I tried to throw in

421
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,080
my pretty

422
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,240
I actually really like that and I might
use that instead of my brick question

423
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,950
from now on pick it like you have the
future potential years

424
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,759
yeah like that are allowed to the
airport

425
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:36,579
well there's a certain type of person
that like that have sure sure yeah he's

426
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:40,359
asking how do you select the people that
you have interview somebody other than

427
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:45,009
like your initial screen i'm in general
i like to have a cross-section of skills

428
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:48,279
like i was saying so I picked the people
that are good at the skills that I want

429
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:52,269
to have them interview for the UH so
like I have somebody that's a good

430
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:56,739
programmer interview for the programming
skills I have somebody one of my and are

431
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:59,949
a very good re-interview for the reverse
engineering skills and so on and so

432
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:00,759
forth

433
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:04,389
I'm in general the the things you don't
want to do if you have like somebody

434
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:07,718
that's hell autistic on your team just
don't ever have him interview anybody

435
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:10,089
because the results are never good

436
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:13,658
like there are people that you don't
want to have interview i thankfully

437
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:18,369
don't have any on my team but there are
people internally in every company I've

438
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:21,369
ever seen where I was like no it and
I've been interviews where it's like why

439
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:25,389
the hell would you pick him to interview
me like this is like horrible language

440
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:29,948
barrier and then on top of that has no
idea how to explain a problem so it's

441
00:29:29,949 --> 00:29:34,329
you want to you want to pick somebody
where the kind of the communications

442
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:48,489
going to be easy right here so you ring
so in terms of that I can

443
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:52,329
oh crap sorry and now it's bright colors

444
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:57,819
he's asking how how we rank or score
after an interview in general like we

445
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:01,269
don't have to as much and I'm spoiled
when it comes to this because

446
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:06,219
everybody's been referral based so we're
it's either just like a no or yes and we

447
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:09,789
actually have never had an offer turned
down so every time we've made an offer

448
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:10,869
it's been accepted

449
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:15,819
so there's not been like a serious
process for that um in general the best

450
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:19,539
way to do it in my opinion from what
I've experienced with at other jobs and

451
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:24,158
in general is having a roundtable with
have the same people interview all of

452
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,119
them and then you pro and con all of
them like you can't you don't score them

453
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:32,139
but like you pro and con all of them
with the same people and then you see

454
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:35,559
who everybody would want to work with
the most and you make sure that you have

455
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,410
their peer the people they would be
working with as part of that round

456
00:30:39,410 --> 00:31:00,590
yeah that number of new sure um it in
general i find it hard to say things

457
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:04,699
like you should have X number of
questions and a scoring system from A to

458
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:10,850
B and because it's eight people aren't
exactly scorable in my opinion like on

459
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:15,889
such a strict basis it's much more like
if you put it if you like everybody up

460
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,620
together you're gonna have you're going
to be able to be like these are the ones

461
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,739
I want to work with like that you'll be
able to draw the delineation of like

462
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,830
throw these away and these are the ones
that I want to work with that tends to

463
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:30,679
be better number of questions is tough i
like i said i like a conversation for an

464
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,510
interview so I don't go in with like I
need to ask these questions i go in with

465
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:39,379
I need to know if you have if you you
will be able to do this job that's more

466
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:44,600
important to me so I'd say number of
questions and stuff yeah he's less

467
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,689
because he's gonna have something dumb
can tell a red egg laying the sign of

468
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:57,770
Indian please don't want to work versus
um usually you'll be able to tell from

469
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,980
the person that dinner he's asking how
do you tell the difference between a red

470
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,580
flag that's a place you don't want to
work in a bad interviewer I'm usually

471
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,389
the bad interviewer is going to be
pretty obvious but also it's an

472
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,030
indication of if the students work in
there maybe you don't want to work there

473
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:17,090
like that's also potentially thing and
it's II usually the bad interviewer will

474
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:22,220
that becomes obvious pretty quickly
because you know that interviewers

475
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,270
stated that pretty like ridiculous in
terms of the things the last will be

476
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,420
able to answer that better

477
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,470
questions from a manager and that seemed
okay but when you get to the period of

478
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:36,480
you sometimes maybe never been up here
in the u.s has me what kind of preview

479
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:44,700
but I sure that real thing yeah so so in
my are you in a beauty pageant right if

480
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,740
it don't know we're not going to go
there so yeah so I had the same problem

481
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,330
with a lot of my interviews and heard me
you actually came across with a question

482
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,540
of cock with what was the confidence
level of the person doing the

483
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,280
interviewing so the guy that asked me
about my call of duty and video games

484
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,300
and I was an awful person because I
don't do what about pentesting as a god

485
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,820
this guy was completely confident all
day long he knew what he was talking

486
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:16,290
about he had everything down a nervous
interviewer or somebody that's new to

487
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,020
doing . interviewing they're generally
not going to have that level of

488
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,400
confidence and so for me that was kind
of cut off of well okay this persons ask

489
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,790
me questions I'm not really getting a
good feel here but I kind of feel like

490
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,120
they may not be have done this a whole
lot I mean I've been interviewing a

491
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,689
whole lot recently so I'm kind of an
expert on that one and this person is

492
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,400
not so I get the only benefit out and
also if there are other peer interviews

493
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,940
involved and they're stronger than I'm
like well it's just that one person they

494
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,600
want on their game that day but yet he
was a confidence level

495
00:33:49,400 --> 00:34:19,610
on your yeah yeah actually that boy was
me so it's been my early on you way I

496
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:24,350
actually go through the entire interview
just because you hit a red flag

497
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:29,569
I mean it could be like an IED level
explosion but you never know what's

498
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,290
going on

499
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:33,949
I always finish the interview for two
reasons 1i want to know what the rest of

500
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:38,389
it is out there i may be surprised it's
gonna educate me for future interviewing

501
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:43,609
an interviewee so it's good to know plus
something might have just happened in

502
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,880
what's going on with that person's life
and I always give them the benefit of

503
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,480
the doubt it's like hey I realize this
is probably gonna work out but I want to

504
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,810
finish it out and my wife can tell you
when i finished up the interview with

505
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,070
the call of duty dude I was crushed and
I like cried myself to sleep in a fetal

506
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,580
position in the closet that night but I
learned from it now I'm up here talking

507
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:06,529
to you guys about this stuff so you know
finished up as the interviewer on the on

508
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,190
the other side of that the when you get
a red flag like that you want to finish

509
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,550
I mean give them the benefit of the
doubt if it's something like they try to

510
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,870
answer a question too hard and and they
don't actually know anything about it

511
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:22,009
you know move on to something else you
can cut off an interview short very

512
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,390
easily i've done that before it like I
it's a point of I'm now wasting your

513
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,980
time and you're wasting my time so no I
don't tell them that

514
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:41,210
sure I i have had interviews where I
would wear I've basically told a person

515
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,600
yeah this isn't this isn't the right fit
and guided them towards what i thought

516
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,680
might be the right fit for them but it's
tough to do that sometimes and people

517
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,399
don't accept that kind of criticism very
well a lot of the time so you have to

518
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,890
kind of way whether or not you want to
go about it that way

519
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,420
the other piece I interviews i try to
educate but like if somebody doesn't

520
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,490
know something I'll tell them the answer
to it after

521
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,330
her after i asked them because like at
least they learned something from it but

522
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,630
in terms of cutting off interviews the
one thing i will say even if you're in a

523
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:13,070
series of interviews that a person is up
for if you hit red flags and you're sure

524
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:17,360
you're not hiring a person cut off the
interview sequence immediately like

525
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,410
there's no need to have more interviews
if you're just wasting people's time

526
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:26,480
because there's no you're just wasting
time wasting so you can just let them

527
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,660
know that this isn't a good fit via
email or let your recruiter do it or

528
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:34,520
whatever and cut it even if you're in
the second interview out of four

529
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,890
interviews that you've already scheduled
it's totally fine to knock that out any

530
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,640
other questions were way over time so
we'll be at the bar and we'll buy you a

531
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,350
drink but thanks guys
