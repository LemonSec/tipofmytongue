twitter at infant namecheap don't ask

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,650
about the name i'm awesome IT guy by day
by night i do physical penetration

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,880
testing i am now starting in network
penetration testing hopefully to have

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:23,400
that down soon muscle developer i
developed in jaiva get to see python

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:32,820
c-sharp also a windows foam wait wait on
Windows Phone he bought you have those

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,770
but we're thing is married she added
this photo powerpoint has this new thing

7
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,579
called design ideas which lets you make
great slides by uploading the slide to

8
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,410
the cloud and I had no problem uploading
the size of the crowd if Microsoft one

9
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,459
look at it they can some like okay let's
go game

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,360
give me teens and where they're
great-looking lot of payment according

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,640
to Microsoft really actually have an
iphone i don't know if that's any better

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,049
i also used to work for a company ran by
this guy

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:16,470
what name is on for global IT at a call
center here in Kentucky also have a

14
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,490
hedgehog and i am also a foursome
speaker thank you

15
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,369
so first off before the talk does start
i do have to give some apologies my

16
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,500
first apology is I am sorry for the
description of the talk i was in the car

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,200
riding up the description didn't think i
was gonna get the Derby Khan and I'm

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,079
like okay let's just submit anyway see
what happens

19
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,189
got the email max oh okay I get to wait
the update now also i'm sorry for the

20
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,139
live demo we will have a live demo I
just gonna be windows base i was

21
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,060
planning to have this on a mobile
simulator iOS or Android our mac heart

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,950
or job did die in the main development
machine we did not use get unfortunately

23
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,380
so we did have a back-up we actually
turn off time machine

24
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,950
and we were quoted twelve-thousand
dollars for the SSD repaired so again

25
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,410
sorry about that

26
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,380
so of course my company told me I had to
add legal stuff and that's actually a

27
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,790
disclaimer

28
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,370
so this talk doesn't express the views
of myself and myself only my employer

29
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:40,480
former current and future is not liable
for anything in this talk we have

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,109
reached out to the corporations and
vendors about any possible for abilities

31
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:51,070
any complaints should be sent to
complaints at not infosec dot-com for

32
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,989
further analysis by legal professional
in almost a nice in case English is not

33
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,640
your first language I don't wanna get
sued that you now see this in for the

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:12,730
languages so we have spanish we have
french I'm not reading that we have

35
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:21,459
going on and then we have weddings if
you cannot read that I don't know who

36
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,500
you are

37
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,340
so now we got all the legal stuff out
the way great we have to get to the good

38
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,270
talk

39
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:34,780
so first off this is gonna be a no hands
up or not survey um you don't have to

40
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,760
it's just I'm trying to figure out who
the crowd is so we're going to a who he

41
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,760
who here has heard of or use google
cloud platform

42
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,790
Wow more people thought he know they had
it until my reddit gold aspired to start

43
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,489
seeing ads for to get 300 always free

44
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:59,740
well Microsoft Azure okay um mainly used
for online ad services are durisimo 365

45
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:08,680
kind of service about AWS good so we're
gonna be mainly using AWS and this whole

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:16,209
entire talk are not because i'm told to
or I'm not being paid by them is just my

47
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:24,000
personal preference i do i am a sysadmin
for AWS so I do like AWS morning

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,900
solutions for this talk you can replace
it with any other solution you want or

49
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,390
physical in case you don't know what AWS
is the school and learn a little bit

50
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,260
first

51
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:41,940
so we're gonna have an AWS 101 so it's a
cloud-based platform offers services

52
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:51,240
like easy to route 53 s3 device farm rd
s SMS lambda um services i have your

53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,780
marker of the most popular which is easy
to which is your virtual private servers

54
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,840
route 53 of course is your dns s reuse
easier simple storage services RDS is

55
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,429
your relational database services device
form is literally a device form of it

56
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,350
mobile devices and more you get per hour
pricing you don't have to pay up front

57
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:17,400
of large fee and then be bill we can use
server for an hour you can deploy it in

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,060
a couple of seconds which makes great
for penetration testing also get 140

59
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,900
access who does not like getting one
upset for access to a machine so thanks

60
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,000
exhale XKCD because you don't make me a
sandwich and we magically get a sandwich

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,110
from AWS in case you have co-workers you
can give them IM access you can have

62
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,530
nine percent route so they can't delete
you that will be kind of stupid to have

63
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,989
so notes delete you they don't like you
like hey I want to meet this person and

64
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:01,830
then gets fired you can spin up in OS
and couple of seconds and then there's

65
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:09,539
tons of integration which is memory
mainly like why like it if you do want

66
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,580
to learn more about AWS i am going to be
offering free training for the entirety

67
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,830
of the con if you want to get in touch
with me by my twitter or email i have

68
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:25,830
five thousand dollars were for training
just to give away so we can sit down do

69
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,590
some training just want a little bit
more this bucket gets filled up so often

70
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,419
i'm not even sure how much they've been
thought up

71
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:43,270
so let's go about what this talk is and
what the top really isn't so maybe we're

72
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,880
going to be doing a proof of concepts
we're going to show on that this

73
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,890
solution is feasible

74
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,539
however it may not be the perfect
solution yet we're trying to get all the

75
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,810
bugs excel and make sure it's gonna be a
feasible solution in the future how to

76
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,340
use AWS or any other cloud platform for
us not so into the purpose

77
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,890
AWS is not meant for penetration testing
but they do allow in an outbound

78
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,090
penetration testing

79
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:16,960
yes they do have a lot of DoD contracts
what and why the need is so we're going

80
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,820
to go over who needs us

81
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:27,010
why do we need it and where can we use
it also had to be a cool we have sore so

82
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,440
what this talk really isn't

83
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:37,270
now I promise you there's no O'Day's if
you're looking for a day I hate say you

84
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,539
came to the wrong hawk

85
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,010
I'm not attacking our person or company
i'm not attacking anyone during this

86
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,880
talk and I'm especially not sporting a
tosser you agreements again I don't want

87
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,790
to get soon hopefully this is not gonna
be a bad talk again they said I had

88
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:02,290
first time speaker so trim a little bit
lightly here and it may seem like a

89
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:06,880
selfish trust me this is not so switch
again this is my opinion your opinion

90
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:17,620
may vary so this is my phone I still
rocking iphone 5s ok I mean it's old

91
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:24,610
still works great but this is one
problem it's not really designed for

92
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:32,110
hacking is designed to be a close source
easy-to-use operating system on a kind

93
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:39,280
of good bill phone now it's mainly
targeted to some other end users but

94
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,049
again tons of these iphones

95
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:51,050
this is not my phone I wish it was but
the nexus lines are Android any android

96
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,630
phones can hack pretty easily

97
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,649
andrea is an open-source operating
system you can do almost anything you

98
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:03,019
want an android or an android phone as
long as you have the way to root it and

99
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:10,579
uploaded waters so why are we even
talking about this

100
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,709
so this all started back three years ago
some my friends now we're joking around

101
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:22,279
saying hey let's hack with our phones we
didn't really know that cali no hunter

102
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:28,010
was even a thing we didn't know that
this stuff existed we knew Callie was a

103
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,800
thing we know you can solid on our
phones also get iphones we couldn't do

104
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,870
much on those they're very locked down
unless you either a gay jailbreak or

105
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:47,240
being a public APR private api then we
started playing this game this game is

106
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,390
called watchdogs if you heard of it

107
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,600
basically you're overplaying the primary
guy

108
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,959
aiden pearce you you're in the city of
Chicago Chicago installs a stupid thing

109
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:07,310
called CTOs which controls the whole
entire city on basically 10 s we can't

110
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:13,969
have that now Windows but this in
control board and what even that would

111
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:21,290
even be feasible so again he is a hacker
he has he's basically gotten more

112
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:28,490
ability for CTOs and put on his phone he
can then do anything in the city and

113
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,230
when I mean anything I legitimately mean
anything

114
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:39,440
so there is a video what c2s does which
I'll show you right now was actually it

115
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,130
does

116
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:46,490
America's first central operating system
ctos is a computer software that manages

117
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:51,529
entire cities providing centralized
control over subway lines traffic lights

118
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:55,970
surveillance cameras and electricity
grid a computer now controls the major

119
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:02,990
city again that is something that we're
going to but I would never like to see

120
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,629
not only the things i mentioned but
controls ATMs all EMS services it

121
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:13,790
control anything within a city once you
gain access to that you're golden

122
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:19,519
you have anything for the user so that's
where we got the idea for this top 12

123
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:27,050
hackmore phones again we're on lockdown
phones and can't really do much so our

124
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:34,248
main goal for this talk is it sounds
pretty audacious is to put cali on

125
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:39,800
android phones iPhones in windows phones
again

126
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,939
that sounds pretty audacious we have
been called idiotic we have been called

127
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:45,139
liars

128
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:52,579
just because people think that these
phones can't really run anything and we

129
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:57,109
have developed the applications we have
developed the backbone we have gotten

130
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:03,500
this working with a twenty-four percent
success rate the moment and with current

131
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:10,699
development we are currently alpha 0.02
very very low after working for three

132
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:17,870
years we finally got something working
and I mentioned windows phone

133
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,189
yes we are going to put in someone's
phone is anyone here at you have a

134
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:30,860
Windows 10 sorry for you but really yes
we are putting this on windows phone i

135
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,550
do know that there is a fanbase out
there for windows phone and I am NOT

136
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,069
hating on this one I really do like
witness home

137
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:44,509
it's just that this saying yes we're
putting cali on this also microsoft

138
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:51,199
please up to me i upgrade windows to on
the first day but again this is a mango

139
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:58,279
we're putting cali on these three
devices so but this isn't ale for us

140
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:03,889
long nights . here drinking constantly
crying

141
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:08,629
in the fetal position getting this
software working of course we all have

142
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:13,639
day jobs we have to do those first again
we've been working on this for three

143
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:21,769
years trying to get this perfected and
now we did so before I mentioned cali

144
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:26,329
net hunter most you guys know Callie net
hunter only runs on these devices

145
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:34,519
officially supported by the cali Team
six devices that's not a lot and for

146
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,859
those devices you also have to have a
external Wi-Fi antenna get to get a

147
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:44,660
tp-link or other good are other
compatible device that hooks the back of

148
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,879
the phone use an OTG cable that's really
not a good solution

149
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:56,089
I mean yes it does help with the
hardware but with having that solution

150
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:57,799
you're adding bulk to your phone

151
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:04,699
you also make it more suspicious and
also devices are expensive yo really

152
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:13,128
this is on swapper nexus 6 last sold for
the 32 gig 175 is probably in pretty bad

153
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:20,899
condition nexus 5 19 on i'm gonna say
it's a little bit better condition but

154
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:30,079
the nexus 7 $200 nexus 9 240 also i mean
if you wanna buy the next six brand-new

155
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:38,118
$300 shipped and sold by amazon that's
way too expensive for phone especially

156
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:43,220
when you have a 400 or 500 dollar phone
right in your pocket

157
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:51,860
so again why not use your own device
that's what we're trying to get that and

158
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,829
also important my buying stuff

159
00:14:54,829 --> 00:15:00,709
most employers will not buy you a
five-hour dongle and first-hand I do

160
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:06,258
understand this but supporters are
pretty stingy about this stuff and when

161
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:12,350
they see a purchase order come in for a
phone like quiet lounges your phone we

162
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,669
can just pay the bill

163
00:15:13,669 --> 00:15:17,150
there are other pay a bill then bye

164
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:25,010
so we said we're gonna be putting this
on all three major platforms so we do

165
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:30,650
have a list of requirements we do have
to go over so this is a current this is

166
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,550
smallest of the current requirements we
do require for you to have your phone

167
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,290
iOS iOS 10 running on iphone 5s or later
with current jailbreak currently does

168
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:47,420
not really a joke after iOS 10 iOS 9.3 .
3 is currently latest one

169
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,160
you can also use your Apple watch if you
do have one of those devices has to be a

170
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,390
series one or later with watch us three
Windows Phone OS 10 or later

171
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,870
android lollipop with route also you
have to have a current active internet

172
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:09,890
connection 200 megabytes of storage 1
gig ram bluetooth 4.0 if this actually

173
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:19,790
needed and active or working USB port
again get medium also almost every newer

174
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:26,780
device works every device we have tested
works it's a small list of devices we

175
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:32,839
have tested but again we are getting but
a good success rate especially for an

176
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,990
alpha with tons of bugs on a small
amount of devices so whenever we saw

177
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,920
this for basin like mind blown house
even working and here's our current

178
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:55,130
missile testing devices nexus 5 nexus 6
1 plus 3s 7 x of s and 6s plus these

179
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,590
devices we have tests on and we have all
run these for the same test we have

180
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:06,230
connected to an HP printer with a open
wireless network we have one in maps can

181
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,720
we found everything on the network then
we have mcafee Mac authentication on

182
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:19,700
network we basically then use our booth
to corn mac address were in so this is

183
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,290
that's the current test me running to
see if these devices are working now

184
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:30,639
you also might be thinking itself
weights iphones really don't know

185
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,770
for this we do have a contact apple now
we're going to disclose any information

186
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:42,010
of that that's why the iOS side of this
is will be closed source unfortunately i

187
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:48,280
will still be publishing all the files
IPA files you can download it you can

188
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,870
just look at everything in there if you
want to it's just I cannot publish the

189
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:58,810
source code to the legal and so again
these devices are working and we're

190
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:03,370
still taking this concept of hey we
don't need these devices anymore we can

191
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:08,500
use these devices to do these things so
currently does anyone have any questions

192
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,870
at the moment no questions

193
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:20,920
ok so what's going to little bit more of
how this is actual work so we done our

194
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:28,540
main idea whose is for basically why
we're doing this to me Steve this is

195
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:36,490
iphone see if Carly has Wi-Fi enabled
this is a company a company a makes food

196
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:42,310
products for like Walmart so Steve
connects to an open Wi-Fi network on

197
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:47,679
company's network okay we can't have a
little bit more of an idea of how this

198
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,440
is actually going to work so Stephen
opens up the cali connect app on his

199
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,170
phone and first off he does have to have
a current server so whether it be on AWS

200
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:04,720
cloud platform or just a physical
machine as long as it has a dr cali

201
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,930
connector app on it you're good to go

202
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,300
so then Steve starts up starts doing a
split VPN connection so he can retain

203
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,100
their network

204
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,620
awesome can get on the Amazon network so
then processing those r AWS and says hey

205
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,570
I need this inside i'm connecting this
instance ID with this public dns record

206
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:32,379
it routes traffic properly and gets on
the cali server so then the cali connect

207
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,230
app runs a command to actually start up
a new server police on AWS it's gonna be

208
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,520
starting up a file server using linux
and it's gonna be storing all

209
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:50,290
logs after any sessions turned in that
sir will be automatically deleted just

210
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,760
so we can actually see

211
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,170
hey at least we can troubleshoot but
again we're so not one have many logs

212
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:03,940
accessible so let's say Steve starts Ron
aircrack on the network he sees this

213
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,940
open SSID he wants to get into so he
sends commands to the Kelly server and

214
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,610
say okay I want our processes commands
Kally didn't start communicating with

215
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,379
the phone to grab all the information
needs and it starts processing it in the

216
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,510
cloud so what's this dumb process and
once it started process and it won't you

217
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,050
know so once a certain starts letting
you know

218
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:35,530
hey you're golden you may get a wireless
password may say okay I little more time

219
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,260
estimated time with that being said you
we only have a limited number of

220
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,330
applications the are confirmed working
some more very limited some more whole

221
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,300
feature will go over that here in a bit

222
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:56,260
so let's say company a gets kind smart
here and they block VPN traffic

223
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,770
okay well that's not really a problem

224
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:06,730
so now we have Bob Bob parent has 4g on
his phone he also has bluetooth enabled

225
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,870
so we're also going to be working on
trying to get a drop box enabled in the

226
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:16,000
future will you continue like like a
hybrid vega is we have cali light

227
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,100
pre-installed on it and so you can go
ahead start processing demands so

228
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,860
there's company's network and then Bob
just go ahead and connect to the dropbox

229
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:32,320
the dropbox employees into the ethernet
network of any open court hopefully it's

230
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,139
not walk down and then we can get the
company's Network up

231
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:47,260
well i just use icon for dropbox
universal um so with that being said if

232
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:53,770
the company does block all VPN traffic
you're now on 4g LTE which most cellular

233
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,370
providers do not block

234
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:00,590
DPN traffic so we can start running the
same process

235
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,780
yes maybe up your data or you can find
another way to actually buy passes if

236
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,149
they're blocking a certain port we do
have a way to change the default port so

237
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:17,630
you can go say hey if this port working
uses port uses port so the list of tools

238
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:22,700
and current have working is again pretty
small we can have aircraft are fern in

239
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:29,929
map metasploit which is very limited
john the ripper and arts booth and again

240
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:34,760
we are always looking for requests
myself in my to developers we are

241
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,110
currently actively looking for requests
from the community if you have any

242
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,459
requests i highly encourage you to
submit the request and not info sitecom

243
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,320
so we can look at it and see if we can
get that compatibility working so with

244
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,629
this small list

245
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,340
we're still able to do a lot now you
also notice that with the list of

246
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,320
applications to our support him

247
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,050
you do have a CLI arguing I or someone
have a custom GUI or both

248
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,179
so with a custom GUI you can actually
course but it's the way you like you

249
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:12,800
don't have to use are defined you can
make it your defined if you don't like

250
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,580
something there

251
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:20,300
remove it at it you're good normal great
UI stuff if you want to type in a sea la

252
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,030
command on the small phone keyboard

253
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:29,420
I'm not gonna stop you go ahead if you
like using sea lion more great are you

254
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,220
can also use your Apple watch in start
running commands using the custom doing

255
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,890
i just put Syrian there is a joke

256
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,750
it would just be funny to say hey Siri
but john the ripper and get a hash

257
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:49,520
that's something we actually might do
because now Apple did open up Siri

258
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,700
integration for other applications again
we are going to launch an open-source

259
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,520
I'm gonna have the code for Android
Windows Phone and Windows application in

260
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,160
cali OS to be all publicly available we
be able to view any source gonna be

261
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,260
available on github

262
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,640
it however you like we're always looking
for feedback from the community if we

263
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,420
mess up

264
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:22,400
let us know that's a warning here for us
again I'm sorry but any iOS device code

265
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,540
will be closed source again due to
apples legal services in front of one or

266
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,420
more but we know we have a small talk

267
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,130
sit down have a beer whatever we can
wear more about this application i can

268
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,710
show you a little bit more in-depth what
it actually does

269
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:46,220
and again we just learn more how we can
actually advances for the community so

270
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,010
we have a not-so problems

271
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,770
download schedule so currently we are
anticipating that the full windows

272
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,970
application will be available for
download late December 2016 so you can

273
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,710
do is start running on windows at least
I on all the mobile devices

274
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:13,640
it should be a label available in late
March 2017 for iphone devices

275
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,990
we're gonna be in the profile basic
profile use was sorry

276
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,170
this one had the application for you
we're good to go

277
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:26,030
of course we can't publish this on the
app store i'm pretty sure our developer

278
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,129
account will be instantly band

279
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,590
um we're going to also have premium
support in small little support

280
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,640
really you're gonna be offering the same
times we won't try to get back to as

281
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,730
fast as possible if you have a problem
with it we won't try to get back to at

282
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,530
least within 48 hours 3-4 is just going
to give you

283
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:50,780
not much is going to little star ticket
but that's just this is saying you

284
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,760
believe in the project you donated
that's a dollar if you want to donate to

285
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,460
this you can you don't have to use 21
get the same amount support because i

286
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:07,100
don't want to have a system where you
pay for support and you get this SLA I

287
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,510
do not believe in that if you have a
problem with your software we need to

288
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:17,990
fix it we want to know about instantly
will try to fix as fast as possible so

289
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,010
let's go over a quick demo again we're
gonna be demoing the window

290
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:28,790
application so i'm gonna go ahead and
sit out here quick and i currently have

291
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:40,610
a test machines set up on AWS go ahead
and do this here you go ahead and close

292
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:57,830
it if i can get out of this awesome so
again we're growing our tests over here

293
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:03,620
just windows server 2012 r2 standard so
now we're gonna be running the cali

294
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,360
connect that uh we do have to have an
account this is basically how we store

295
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,250
all your in societies all the servers
you added but now we're not gonna be

296
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,330
asking lost you

297
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:19,580
username password more not wanting in
your personal information we don't want

298
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,550
your email or phone number with my
address

299
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:26,389
we don't want anything from you just
because again we do believe youre parte

300
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,420
privacy we do want your privacy to be
there

301
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:34,760
that's what we're asking a lot from you
so i'm gonna go ahead and login here

302
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:47,570
ok so basically everything is going to
be stored on AWS sequel server it is

303
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:53,840
fully encrypted using a double asu
56-bit with salt so everything is going

304
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,770
to be secure

305
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,570
hopefully so now i do have a couple
servers here that we have set up so as

306
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:04,399
you currently have cali in the ESX hosts
at home also in hyper-v also have a

307
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,530
physical desktop but also have on

308
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:14,120
naww s curly look on amazon web services
there is currently no 8am eyesore which

309
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,120
is your custom operating system for easy
to the Kali team did actually drop that

310
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,350
because they weren't given enough
support from amazon i kinda will have

311
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:29,899
some content from it was on that can get
support from so we can going to try to

312
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,960
get the am i up a little bit faster get
a little more

313
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:44,650
port so what's actually hope this works
during the go and try to get vs exos ok

314
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:50,830
so i imagine surprised that you worked
so i can we do have some commands here

315
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:55,300
that i actually have set up against you
start running in map medicine boy John

316
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:01,480
the Ripper aircrack scream well i have
set up if you want add a custom server

317
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,350
you definitely can you can go to
software settings want to have automatic

318
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,879
login just that's just simple stuff um
again you can change the default port

319
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,830
number if you change it on the
calculated up on the host you will need

320
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:20,949
to change in here in this will basically
let you connect at newport um we also

321
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:25,300
offer Killswitch moment so basically
with the kill switch mode enabled as

322
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,970
well as soon as the computer was asleep
or the tilde key is press all VPN is

323
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:37,750
terminated instantly again that's just
protect you make sure nothing happens if

324
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,410
you want a server you can definitely go
ahead and go for the wizard simple

325
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:47,350
process it just needs to server name am
I dns will go and start connecting to it

326
00:29:47,350 --> 00:30:02,560
so let's see if we can try to get these
to actually launch and it looks like

327
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,320
it's actually not watching

328
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:18,850
ok so the demo did it again if we are
incurring alpha we are not expecting

329
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:25,209
this to be a full-fledged software i
dunno a map does work it does crash

330
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,230
history it does crash a whole entire
application within about five seconds

331
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:36,250
ago we are currently trying to get this
torus whatever usable but this is what

332
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,270
we have right now after suffering a
major de los we do have a whole lot more

333
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,290
working on the android and iphone side
and hopefully we do

334
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:52,099
that connection back up and get that
basically backup so everyone can use we

335
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:56,658
are currently going on hardboard coach
am trying to get this the work I've

336
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:04,399
taken a lot of pto to try to get this
actually done I'm this is basically what

337
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:11,059
we got right now and I'm sorry I'm sorry
we didn't have much of a demo here this

338
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:18,649
is crazy what we got and this is what
we're currently working on so this is

339
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:24,949
bullshit again we are going to be giving
out the cali connect app was it free

341
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:37,009
