11
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
it hates me

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,799
alright packing for homeschoolers still
projects from twenty dollars i speak a

13
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,570
lot of conferences every year I did kind
of a technical speech and then the the

14
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,389
next year I do a non-technical speech

15
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:54,869
this is more of my technical day one of
these last year kind of gave everybody

16
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,240
an idea what homeschooling is how you
can incorporate it into your lesson

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,009
plans that and then this one's more of
solid projects

18
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,450
built by highlighted one project last
year my sixteen-year-old did where we

19
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:16,500
literally took 17 boxes to Johnny long
and a professor i made her project

20
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,820
manager for doing that as well as
deploying some educational servers that

21
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,750
I made your build and by the way
whatever is just 14 at the time when we

22
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,970
started this and I didn't make my
fourteen-year-old do all of the linux

23
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,640
plugins and stuff like that from an
online so she loves me and other stuff

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,850
going on

25
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,850
well i'm currently principal security
consultant for into security us formally

26
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,380
solution i've been that for two weeks
our manager prior to that but we just

27
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,010
marched bunch of other company i'm no
longer matter i consider myself a

28
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,329
hardware acker although i suffer from
imposter syndrome so i'll tell you got

29
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:12,690
it bad three kids and about it right now
but obviously you're saying my beautiful

30
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,420
bride and I'm a Christian which plays
into y yd homeschool landmark one of the

31
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,320
reasons why we make that decision and
applause I work for the federal

32
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:30,030
government 20 years a little leery about
their overreaching certain areas and

33
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:36,269
officially I'm the Dean of willing way
Academy anybody here from Kentucky you

34
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:39,989
homeschool you have to send a little
letter letter every year saying around

35
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:46,170
for kids but we pick the Academy name
except letter and cool stuff so solid

36
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,760
beam my wife is the teacher and the
counselor and then cook lunch

37
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,570
I've got an important so why are we
doing this

38
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,959
this isn't

39
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:07,060
Caroline I doing this why are we here
today are because science right still is

40
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,760
the first letter science i believe it's
important that we teach our children at

41
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,620
least fundamental scientific principles
or if you've got a public school that we

42
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,350
supplement what they received from the
public location

43
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:28,600
I it's easier to teach three students
than it is to teach 30 students are

44
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,350
experienced with public school from a
child it was quoting gifted and talented

45
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:43,000
but we discovered was dyslexic is that
the teachers don't necessarily focus on

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,050
the larger percentage they have to focus
on a stellar performer so they can get

47
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,250
them started and then focus on the
problem kids and kind of that sixty

48
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:58,150
percent in the middle sometimes gets
overlooked well why else well my love

49
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:06,340
so the second letter is technology it's
basically learning mostly IT information

50
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:12,010
technology things that you use there's
really not a lot of focus in normal

51
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,349
public school on technology that we use
it as a tool lot of times they don't

52
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,700
even know how to use it

53
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,140
you'd be surprised our local elementary
school in our community

54
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,940
I was talking to one of the the teachers
there that's where we used to go up

55
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,920
scales kids and she was remarking how
she had this you know 1,500 our

56
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,870
projector that was basically a
paperweight

57
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,150
she did not use it they provided
training on how to use the smartboard so

58
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:46,270
I actually help training her and other
teachers staff there right after that

59
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,219
they actually gave them a teacher
training day were they trying on they

60
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,260
had in the classroom from six months so
that's just how public schools are

61
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:02,380
sometimes and then the last two are
engineering and force match so that's

62
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,240
what makes up the still and

63
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:11,319
said I use this picture so I liked the
fact that

64
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:18,699
yeah the government tends to focus on
still federal programs on it we want to

65
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,750
be number one in international testing
the market place and I use the word

66
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,979
marketplace because a lot of money
involved not necessarily education and

67
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:38,409
they tend you not focus on a liberal
arts and no studies use it it really

68
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:43,180
disturbs me sometimes whatever teachers
say they don't teach music because math

69
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,319
is more important

70
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:55,180
music is math it's fractious when you
struggle teaching a child math you can

71
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,750
use music to get those same learning
objectives published so once again are

72
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,400
our daughter thats dyslexic when she
struggles math because she gets her

73
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,179
numbers backwards and it's hard to add
sometimes we focus on music house why

74
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:20,349
also here because I don't want to live
in a band member right if I can do my

75
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:23,830
little part to ensure that their
successful we're not talking

76
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,389
millionaires I'm talking successful like
set their own goals that cheek

77
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,719
they don't have I would like for that to
include self-sufficient but then that's

78
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:41,650
already met my wife i have a lot once
again i'm not saying liberal arts are

79
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,120
important

80
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,979
my wife is one of the most intelligent
right now attended a little mini college

81
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:52,900
here in Kentucky called Georgetown
College it's a liberal arts school but

82
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:59,830
what they teach at what they teach is
how to tie series constants and together

83
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,960
throughout the entire learning
engagement that the whole warriors there

84
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,210
that's the purpose of Liberal Arts not
to study something very specifically

85
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:16,510
that you don't no effect on something
else so that my heart another very great

86
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:16,950
man

87
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:23,010
are bought and sold multiple businesses
retired at age 52 he's a liberal studies

88
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:29,070
she's one of the most technically
competent people that I have he can pick

89
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:35,010
up things read about them and apply and
he will tell you it's because human

90
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:45,060
logic in college with his little sister
almost the other thing is it's your

91
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,910
moral obligation to our nation study
science technology engineering math now

92
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:59,699
I i put this up here as a reminder if
you are starting to the Stillman

93
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,370
programs I i challenge you to go out and
read the history of why this came out

94
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,180
there are a lot of half-truths from the
government

95
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:16,260
they'll tell you things like worth 30 50
industrialized nations that's pretty bad

96
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,300
but they don't take things once again
and this holistic approach those same

97
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,760
things like how will NASA ever compete
in the future if we don't have still now

98
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,060
NASA is actually international
organization just happens to be hosted

99
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,219
think about that we pay the money for it

100
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,670
it's located here but most of the people
that work

101
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,229
masts are no longer us evidence they're
actually immigrants to this country

102
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:53,250
that's not a bad thing we just put you
know Rovers on Mars you're just sex in

103
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,250
years ago that was done an international
effort we are very good in this country

104
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:05,100
combining ideas and making sure that
there are actually you know their works

105
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,280
from the beginning all the way to the
end and that are integrated into the

106
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:15,030
next so it kind of upsets me sometimes
whenever people say you know America ok

107
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,040
so the military 20 years i believe in
murder but also believe in international

108
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:27,630
community and working together by the
way the top ten nations on that list of

109
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,740
of smartest nations

110
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,760
bro they also have the top there are
some of the same list or the number of

111
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,030
teenage suicides that so

112
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:45,100
alright what about homeschool I've been
different if your kids are in school and

113
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:52,210
you're not their primary teacher you are
a teacher so when they come home it's

114
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,920
your job to actually feel that
supplement their public learning part

115
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,790
right

116
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:04,689
oh and this continues to write right I
used to tell my dad you know I have

117
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,080
better test scores than you so I'm
smarter than you remember this

118
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,500
conversation is 15 16 right I apparently
I'm not because i'm still paying a

119
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,520
mechanic whatever he fixes his own car
that's very expensive vegetable list of

120
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,360
things like that so just keepin on

121
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,740
you may have the primary educators but
as a parent you're really screwing up

122
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,320
itself any questions so far

123
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,850
alright let's get into the meat of this
i can stop my grandma will start fun

124
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:44,410
stuff so yeah yeah so let's talk about
gathering resources because if you're

125
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,360
going to do any still projects you need
resources right this usually with public

126
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,470
schools complained about the most so the
first thing I'll tell you is on track to

127
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,180
the garbage day

128
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,800
go around your community give you $MONEY
and pick up everything that your

129
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,130
neighbors throw it if its electron grab
because you're going to need those parts

130
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,900
become a scavenger this is actually
something it's a game now my kids they

131
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:17,260
love it they like bringing back
especially unusual things I VCRs unusual

132
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:25,060
children what VCRs and printers are some
of the best items get the reason i say

133
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,689
that is because you not only have
electrical components inside but you

134
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,480
also have motors years you have rods
that you can bend and making an unusual

135
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,260
shapes so go get stuff your neighbors
their tracks your expression also save

136
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,910
you a lot of the other thing is
craigslist this is Lexington Kentucky

137
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,189
practice page as yesterday

138
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,500
number two is a nice to TV old school
right

139
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,310
actually the VCR connected to the bottom
i love these items you have lots of

140
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:10,420
things in there that you can use
personal projects caution if you get

141
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:19,240
things such as all schools have tubes
and pastors they're gonna pass goes on

142
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,990
there right

143
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,120
microwave microwave area to that mean
they got timers they've got logic

144
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,420
controllers they have motors and those
capacitors and there will kill so avoid

145
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,520
that upper usually upper right-hand
section has the big things that look

146
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,520
like this except they're like bigger
they look like and sometimes co-champs

147
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,040
as a general rule that i kinda hesitate
and saying this but i'll go ahead and

148
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:55,959
say it when you're looking at marquis if
you see something that's 1,000 micro

149
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:02,920
cracks or one military had 30 volts
starting right at that area that's

150
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,599
whatever things are going to pop they're
going to spark and they're going to

151
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,080
scale

152
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,400
p out anything below that is pretty safe

153
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:24,160
I a higher number of guesses are the
further away from voltage that you like

154
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,610
one volt 1000 micro-cracks you won't
even feel it on your skin so those are

155
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:38,170
things that you will need anything
that's pastor or an electronic God so in

156
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,800
old-school electron guns and our whole
focus is to use electricity and such a

157
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,130
way that they can focus that being onto
the screen those are like thousands of

158
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:58,540
volts they can be one fair at ar-15s so
thousand volts . 5 fair is that means

159
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:06,130
you so that old-school TV it's not for
everybody everybody should use I like to

160
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:06,970
take them apart

161
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:14,470
I just that first whatever comes out
afterwards I solid questions about that

162
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:21,130
i think this rubber capacitors they
store charges dissipate very quickly

163
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,130
dissipates into your body can be that

164
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:34,210
yes just starting at anything that's 100
micro I'm sorry I 100 micro 30 volts or

165
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,440
last night discharge trigger anything
above that I don't touch

166
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:45,370
there are special tools you can buy for
discharging baskets they can hold a

167
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,720
charge for years

168
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,380
it depends on the state of the weather
composed of so why's your ceramic vases

169
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,330
are going to be very low-impact you can
touch us finger but yes I'm years

170
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,620
they'll sit on a shelf charged i
discovered that the hard way in the Navy

171
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:09,820
was working an old-school had no
business working on it

172
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,560
they're going to get rid of it as i play
with it that's that's first and right

173
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,609
second mistake was I open the top and it
was still in addressed but yeah

174
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:24,960
start tinkering a lot of bees pass

175
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:33,720
Oh tools tools from craigslist don't go
crazy buying tools first cardiology laid

176
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,770
over time I think it's always
recommended the pair of diagonal

177
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:48,660
diagonal cutters a heavy user arm shrink
gun or a gun if you don't have one just

178
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,810
use the form of those things called yeah
those are very odd i don't usually blow

179
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,739
drying my hair get it right

180
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,639
oh yeah and a good sorry I mean I my
first starting area was a little Freddie

181
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,540
you take it cost me like 12 bucks but I
mean it did its job

182
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,970
we're not building something that you're
going to commercially produced self were

183
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,130
literally just trying to get components
of boards and then solder them back

184
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:28,439
together in some way that it holds right
sometimes for the 15 seconds so keep

185
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,940
that in mind I love harbor free and
northern holes got one of those probably

186
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,120
the best stop to loaner program out
there

187
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:44,340
I you know probably last 10-15 days or
1015 using blood authority since part

188
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:53,730
was right questions about collecting
resources or now except capacitors

189
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,830
remember that websites so everything
that we do at school

190
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:05,700
none of it starts out as original ideas
i always go to one of these websites i'm

191
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,350
going to show you first or back of the
room no starch press they have some

192
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:17,340
really good books i recommend the lady
oh gun book it rocks my son loves it

193
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:23,970
I instructables by some calls this
indestructible because he loves building

194
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:30,410
and destroying it and are usually once
you build something and put which you

195
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:38,600
write it off our instructor will sign up
they'll give you the spam museum or they

196
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,240
want you can set the level of
information get a little bit more

197
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,010
advanced it's going to be hackaday this
is a really good one maybe notifications

198
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:55,730
as well I say advance because they they
actually go up they actually storefronts

199
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,900
that they can sell you a different
things and if you're like I don't have a

200
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:06,050
total to do that that that project than
that though usually able to sell it to

201
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,350
you

202
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,360
they also sell a single word computers
things of that nature sometimes can be

203
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:19,340
hard to find some parks or older
radioshack's tell you how ready are

204
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:29,149
ready to check we are using subscribe to
smarter every day this is a dad is a

205
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,470
scientist

206
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,470
it's a little high level so middle
school high school not a lot of concepts

207
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:43,460
so he just goes right into the science
sometimes I'll usually if we're going to

208
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,910
introduce one of his ideas or projects
i'll review a couple of times we show

209
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,140
the kids because sometimes they can be a
little confusing but that brings us to

210
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,590
this at the king of random love this guy

211
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:04,100
absolutely love it my son was actually
building 10 i summon my daughter's 13

212
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:10,250
they were building things on the road
and I asked him I was like yeah this is

213
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,890
really good ideas i was proud at moments
I'm doing something right everybody

214
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,900
that's on the road like found this
website for idea they started building

215
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:26,450
these items so those are the main ones
that there's a lot of other things that

216
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:34,670
I subscribe to my Mac Mac by sorry it's
a raspberry PI's magazine are it's

217
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,670
really good they have a soft copy
version that counts

218
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:43,789
first time I just kind of stuck over the
side all of our Raspberry Pi projects

219
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:47,720
are usually direction something else by
hackers for charity or other

220
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,989
organizations that use the pass he had
this guy in his great absolutely great

221
00:20:53,989 --> 00:21:00,379
arm so examples of what your kids to do
every one of these projects except for

222
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:06,889
one of my kids already done and usually
what that means is i do and then I

223
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:10,639
forget you know because I forget about
social teaching them and they complain

224
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:15,649
about it and I always have and then I
help them do and then they complain

225
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:23,869
about it then they do it on like I said
every one of these is unoriginal i get

226
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:28,820
from the website usually about a third
fourth time we do one of these projects

227
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,619
they're they're just making stuff up on
that's really what you want right you

228
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:40,609
want your kids to be figuring out what
doesn does not work failure and still is

229
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:52,489
necessary kids that don't fail was going
to summer semester so caution when our

230
00:21:52,489 --> 00:22:01,039
caution just let me explain myself so
the photos are not my photos i suck it

231
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:09,470
started this is my daughter she's 16 why
I i started getting heavy understand my

232
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,679
god do i do because you are to me

233
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:18,710
I don't know it unless I know you can't
define it but whatever you see it you

234
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,100
know it is i still don't see why I can't
explain it

235
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:30,739
so what action shots right no learners
she can make the background lighting

236
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:36,200
I mean like perfect silhouette right
sun's behind i could never take that

237
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:44,389
picture depth-of-field focus or lack of
focus right and then you combine at all

238
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:48,919
this is what she does she was gonna be
an artist someday this

239
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:55,580
what I do with target so I said some of
the photos are things that I've taken

240
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,949
all of you come from those websites that
i gave because it's just yeah that's

241
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:11,540
cool that's so hasty in tennis the very
first project did was probably three

242
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:18,409
years ago now my son was seven star was
ten my other daughter was in king of my

243
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:24,200
life so I had a teacher that was
horrible i used to write about my life

244
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:32,210
and almost or not doing anything and she
left me the kingdom 42 on a mission trip

245
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,490
there it was but I told you been
Christian is important to me because i

246
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,440
have great power

247
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:50,149
so this is the very first eight entire
we those literally phone board glue gun

248
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:58,850
a template from instructables aluminum
foil and paper so you cut it all out put

249
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:06,830
it together and it's a hf antenna
two-track system that's what's 3333 are

250
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:12,889
very good directional antenna actually
got rid of my radio shack HD antenna

251
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:18,770
whatever will I was really surprised
kids the excellent job so this is

252
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,540
something that i gave instructions and
scissors to a seven-year-old general

253
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:32,180
legal wonderful and get a little bit
more advanced so this is a multi

254
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:38,150
directional antenna actually
bidirectional and very so by advanced I

255
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,950
mean this user would they have power
tools in the drill that use a

256
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:48,980
screwdriver and cocaine and of course
that failing is the only thing i bought

257
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:56,300
this scenario everything else i had
strapped failing converts the RF from

258
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,090
usually

259
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:05,909
150-200 arms are putting their 275
office also that he used you can build

260
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:15,060
Balin lot of effort right i bought six
or seven dollars so involves a lot of

261
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:22,770
crappy if you want to build your own so
many things i saw i replace the HD trap

262
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:28,050
antenna system with this one and we went
from i live in Lexington Kentucky where

263
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:34,740
we really have no station seven stations
get this one actually pick up to local

264
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:42,570
stations so that is almost 65 miles away
to my house with this excellent to put

265
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:49,950
two of these intense i get 13 stations
so that rocks if you do the math

266
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,180
yes they have one of the mapping
programs any ham ham guys in here

267
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:59,250
build your own tennis i will I brought
that to mind Nomar the guy that taught

268
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,410
me and he's like that's a lie

269
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:07,740
several my antennas and he's like oh
that's pretty cool so he did all the

270
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:16,200
analysis on it earlier good intense fire
starter so my son come Scouts I was a

271
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,410
boy scout love fires I love camping that
luxury

272
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:26,159
that's another story I so what are you
talking about fire that's a very

273
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,750
technical topic so you have three
elements for any fire you have to have

274
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:37,380
oxygen you have she have fuel so you can
incorporate something as simple as the

275
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,050
dryer and vaseline toilet paper rolls
and come up with your own chemical fire

276
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:49,409
starters I don't have a saline use
candles the wax candles preferred

277
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,080
parallax but what

278
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,120
so this is beautiful because everything
everything there is either combustible

279
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:05,040
or mobile and it's slow learning you can
actually start fires i smite my side and

280
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,659
start a fire with wet wood using one

281
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:14,560
artwyrd up so i have to explain the
whole theory of why fires importance on

282
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,310
what you need for fire then you take
away one of those elements see what

283
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,389
happens

284
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:23,620
so this was a whole week's worth of
science based on this one project

285
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,880
Oh little bit less technical you don't
have all those things on your own dryer

286
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,520
i guess my bag of our start a fire with
that is it possible

287
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,680
yes it's possible you can hold that a
certain way capture the light focus the

288
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,360
beginning now you're talking about
reflection refraction diffraction

289
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,149
diffusion so these are all scientific
terms you can incorporate the bag of

290
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,150
water and fire in my heart

291
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:01,419
let's say you don't have water in a
ziploc bag what do you have plastic and

292
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:10,690
urine capture it put in a tight ball the
same this next a lot more of a goldwater

293
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:28,420
oh but yeah just lit my son's like a
plastic and start a fire outside the

294
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:37,000
speaker so yeah this is the box and this
was the parts list on instructables

295
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:45,160
having everything in this example this
Peter I'm sorry yeah this jacket here

296
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:51,100
the 3.5 millimeter jack i came from just
stuff that I got actually my neighbor

297
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:58,389
clean it up a little bit on some of it
really is just because you bought you

298
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:08,380
right so I destroy his old stuff use it
over here and here so the first time I

299
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:17,320
tried to incorporate ac/dc is much
better 9-volt batteries way to go from

300
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:25,659
most most own projects with us you know
bad moments is that whenever alkaloid

301
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:31,960
metal can AC I can insulate that circuit
enough to make this work and it

302
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:42,190
this isn't the original black and simple
robots this is this is really where my

303
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:49,060
kids taken off and they love doing this
once again every one of these parts for

304
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:57,970
this five called bipedal two-footed
robot arm hanging from your face and

305
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:09,550
this was a memory either friend this
old-school I printer are those

306
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:18,790
yeah I had one did not always the metal
containers but I mean this thing ended

307
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:22,000
up being this tall is great

308
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,790
well the the first one with gold this
one will fire as well asked a motor and

309
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,350
a huge battery but it's really tiny

310
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:39,950
right and my son was like yeah I want to
use those color-coded days just tell me

311
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:45,500
about and a project so is the resistors
on the floor with no they really

312
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,870
inspired lips so up here just get
creative

313
00:30:50,870 --> 00:31:00,889
this this is one he actually is on so
and by design we drew it on this second

314
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,890
one we have troubles

315
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:14,510
once again I think the only for this was
the glue to have a good time right

316
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:18,679
that's what it's all about our
electricity whatever you're talking

317
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:27,110
about electricity but the safeway like
that don't use AC AC by had my wife

318
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,668
picked up the kids

319
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:33,500
it's called snap circuits I think she
got himself about fifteen dollars at our

320
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:40,880
local long secondhand store really have
something like a little breadboard you

321
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:49,520
snap on the circuit diagrams drawing so
we played with these for probably a

322
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:57,049
couple of months a really good
foundation of just electric circuits and

323
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:03,260
in my kids are building on so I
challenged almost building those same

324
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:10,160
circuits with stuff from my so we don't
use circuits and you want to just go up

325
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,510
to the garage

326
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:22,100
let's get here that a battery saver they
just no not the police yet I wanted to

327
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:28,399
introduce light to my kids I am NOT an
Aeronautics guy i know very little

328
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:35,389
no I dragon with that was more from
submarines same principle the arm so

329
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:44,779
onion soubise plank and a fun way many
crossbows this thing around . that cash

330
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:50,719
wonderful this many crossbow is actually
a laundry flip that's how big

331
00:32:50,719 --> 00:33:01,039
so they're fighting with matches
shooting each other good in my head is

332
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:12,559
all white men go outside with that so
good question

333
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,779
it's a piece of wood scrapes it does
catch on fire not the wood the match so

334
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:20,779
whatever you do this outside trying to
be safe

335
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:30,979
start a little bit more advanced so
Rockets who doesn't have two leaders we

336
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:35,570
don't drink soda spandex bottle one of
my son's like all three gonna make it

337
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,789
right

338
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:42,559
so will this put together a little
baking soda and vinegar that your

339
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,999
propulsion now I want you have the
bigger the bottle morning that you have

340
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:51,799
and it's kind of tricky get the timing
down or you can go a little more fancy

341
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:58,519
this is a system with the catch system
and this little arrow right here that's

342
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:04,190
a little nipple that you can plug your
bicycle pump to pump it up and so you

343
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:12,139
can for your son ways like 20 pounds ten
right ways almost yes and you have

344
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:21,019
school system which I love so that's
just pressure with air or water so

345
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:21,828
either way

346
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:27,349
instructables that's where I got this
and then to kind of wrap it up

347
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:32,029
these are some of the more complicated
ones my wife loves lobby they always

348
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:33,889
have stuff on clearance

349
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:38,929
this is a little two liter bottle that
holds a weather system she can go out

350
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:43,200
and make judgments on you know how much
rain did we have all right

351
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:50,129
that down that time like that over time
I tend to do just go out of my mind on

352
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:54,480
me so I looked at that was like how can
i make that better we have as berry pies

353
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,980
lying around the house so I found this
website called raspberry whether they

354
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,240
actually have all the software that you
need to load your Raspberry Pi they

355
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,250
actually have android and iphone so that
you can actually talk to the station

356
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,869
remotely and download the information
right then you can export the data

357
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:21,060
tables and manipulate things that this
is really cool website this is the one

358
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,900
that we have not done yet that I are
just itching to do

359
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:34,770
fortunately on the road seven out of
eight so troubled 25-percent this

360
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:42,930
morning this is my daughter works your
sporting in the middle of kenya

361
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:48,328
troubleshooting a rachel pot which you
can step over hfc you all about Rachel

362
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:55,710
eyes like their first iteration of
educational services are and then that

363
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:01,349
culminated with 2 xa·ens number one
built two of these skeletons lies or

364
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:12,150
ruggedized I solar power take DC DC
volts all the way to AC 240 volts verse

365
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:19,170
it's a nice . 5 volt signal two lamps
out around very high internal and hey

366
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:25,079
Ryder hotels i've been trying to speed
shooting on for years and never said no

367
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,430
to a fourteen-year-old puts her
application and I have to go whenever

368
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,120
she gets elected

369
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:42,830
I do use my children like you don't

370
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:53,900
alright I and finally fail fail often
fell early so constantly so that some of

371
00:36:53,900 --> 00:37:01,340
the biggest you know pearls we overcame
this is our failure and my kids know

372
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,260
this and i encourage them to fail i mean
a ten-year-old it hurts normal

373
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,300
sixteen-year-old we're going to come up
with some really dumb ideas designs but

374
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:17,060
it's their way of learning they don't
know it's done even when never fails

375
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,320
they know it's not done

376
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,100
they know its processes hitter at fixing
things

377
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:33,290
so there's that I any questions whenever
I want time to get off alright yeah

378
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:41,360
anybody gets hurt like your mobile down
7-3 clothes hung out with their

379
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,530
electronic storage called your list they
have like everything in terms of

380
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:51,020
electronics if you take just any type of
electronic today more than likely have

381
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,900
it was another people down there like
this one guy have a refrigerator

382
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,650
motherboard blue call the company and no
you have to buy this like pot or then he

383
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:06,920
took down there was there i go here is
use it was dollar surgery so it's about

384
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:13,310
purush yet down 7 Street some of and all
on one for that area is all going to go

385
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:19,730
down left or something like that but
they have like yourself has a really

386
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,900
sort of electronic those stars are out
of action they really are

387
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:32,210
that's what we find is Jim exactly and
otherwise yes sir question about

388
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,200
software

389
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,680
yes

390
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:46,919
ok have it software place where there's
natural specific places natural point

391
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,480
across

392
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,480
hardware software

393
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,710
yeah I avoid software because I I I
don't do software well like I'm not a

394
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:03,690
developer the last language I learned to
code in basic and that was 90 91 and

395
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,790
that was a lot of the crash course for
the right before they said we don't use

396
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:16,740
basic that's right i attended see and
some assembly and compiled languages

397
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,080
that was another one of course that it

398
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:24,360
yeah scratch about the only thing I've
ever used

399
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,480
yes sir there's some other one my prayer
camp

400
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,780
yes I wouldn't want to talk about that
online minecraft camps

401
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:40,320
it's literally like that summer pants
where you're on minecraft servers and

402
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,970
the whole school

403
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:49,709
oh yeah i think at bsides anvils talking
to somebody about they actually have

404
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:55,740
remote schools now they're easy
minecraft servers for students to login

405
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:05,970
scrap someone who scratch scratch tea
and a question just learn to program

406
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:17,279
with minecraft stroke and where did you
get that closer start to press a lot of

407
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,470
their books and they can have like
children python book and I can almost

408
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,450
keep up with that

409
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:30,598
don't have their Swift like Apple Swift
yeah it's called Swift way around it

410
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,660
came out highlights and it helps all I
went through with concomitant really

411
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:45,149
cool i like almost like a scratch or you
can help build iOS yeah so if you want

412
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,570
to be part of the man feel like you're
not know

413
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,570
yes

414
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,910
yeah total yes

415
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:12,150
so back to that logic discussion i was
talking about before our part of why I

416
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:18,990
suck at code is because i have a hard
time with a non-physical attack vs so I

417
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,520
still print out an email sometimes if I
really concerned about what it says

418
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:31,319
printed out market up but that's because
i was never taught logic until a later

419
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:38,009
age so I was probably my 34 i actually
had a course on and that's pretty sad so

420
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:43,109
if you can teach your kid logic early
then it becomes part of the wife and i

421
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:47,880
don't mean but there's a difference and
it might say math and everything else so

422
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,420
a equals B go sit there for eight will
see is excellent math you can prove that

423
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:03,359
water are on a boat i'm driving through
water water is just like a cloud because

424
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,440
that's made of water so whenever an
airplane flights for a cloud you in
