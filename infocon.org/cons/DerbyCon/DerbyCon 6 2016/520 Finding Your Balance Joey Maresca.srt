1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
they're kind of work

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,490
well it's twelve o'clock so i'll go
ahead and get started

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,198
you guys ready all right uh-huh good
afternoon just barely everybody my name

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,160
is Joey lost knowledge the talk is
finding your balance kind of about

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,180
finding your work-life balance and what
that's all about

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,679
so i guess first off you know why am I
doing this talk

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,450
there's a conversation i had about
should say i want jun 16 so what about

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:47,640
four months ago three months ago with
total cough on twitter about you know

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,500
she felt like there wasn't such things
work like bounce that didn't exist and I

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,579
kind of disagree with her because i feel
like i've managed to find find that and

11
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,319
so that's kind of why I want to give
this presentation because you know I I

12
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:11,070
felt like there were other people who
also didn't think it existed and so I

13
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,729
want to try to share some of my
background in history with folks so that

14
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,220
they could hopefully find it a little
faster than it took me so if you knows

15
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:27,000
about doing ten plus years into my
security career before I found a

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,710
situation that i thought was properly
balanced so hello about my background I

17
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:42,839
grew up in Kentucky I went to school
high estate and then I spent 10 years

18
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,240
living in Northern Virginia and the DC
metro area which from a low-stress

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,390
perspective is one of the last places in
the world you probably ever want to live

20
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,659
it is significantly more stressful in my
mind that probably even some other large

21
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,450
cities and I think in part because of
how sprawling them the metropolis area

22
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,310
is

23
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,060
just a little bit more background this
will be a little bit more work related

24
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,610
so when I got out of school the first
thing i want up doing was working at the

25
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,970
US Patent Office which was probably one
of the most boring jobs I've ever had

26
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:27,510
I'm you know it was a was my first drop
out of school it was good in the sense

27
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,380
that you know I had a pretty set
schedule when I was in the office is

28
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,269
working when i was in the office that
wasn't working but it was pretty it was

29
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:42,150
a pretty bad commute had the benefit of
being mostly via public transit so I

30
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,310
didn't have to necessarily you know pay
attention to what I was doing but it was

31
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:54,000
still very boring job and having just
been moved out there it was very

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,920
isolating right so he goes someplace
where you don't know anybody and you

33
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,609
spend 8 + hours a day working attack on
two hours a day commuting you have a lot

34
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:15,450
less time to actually you know do things
so i left there after about eight months

35
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:24,089
or so and started working for a company
called at one which was a small steps

36
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:31,680
validation company was my first real
security job you know it again working

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,720
40 hour weeks my commute went from being
an hour was probably about the same

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,889
early on it maybe middle closer to 40
minutes but it was it was a far more

39
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:54,810
interesting job and and as such kind of
kept me motivated and it also helped

40
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,209
that it was a much smaller company

41
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,470
alright so when you being in a new area
not know a lot of people was good to be

42
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:07,170
with a company that actually kind of had
a small-company feel and had a kind of

43
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,679
family atmosphere because people wanted
to spend time with each other outside of

44
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,579
the office and so that was that was a
big boost as well kind of me staying out

45
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:28,409
there so about three years into working
their way up by saic and not solely

46
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:32,849
decis fault things started changing a
lot some of the atmosphere things

47
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:38,729
obviously changed but the same time and
that that . i took on more managerial

48
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:45,270
duties i started doing more project
management people management all the fun

49
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,460
things that take people don't want to do
especially when they're young and

50
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:58,020
working 60 + $OPERAND hour work weeks so
it was a real drain on me i was

51
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,490
traveling a lot and that kind of you
know took me to my next step and i knew

52
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,180
i wanted to get back to a smaller
company and so that's what i wanted

53
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,400
doing i went back to a small company and
tenacity that was doing government

54
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,020
contract work

55
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,039
this is the first time I really got into
penn testing which is what I'm still

56
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:28,979
doing today again it was a small
atmosphere a little bigger than a twin

57
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,510
and i think its peak was 12 or 15 people
tenacity as peak was about a hundred

58
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:40,289
hundred fifty but it was still a very
very small atmosphere we still did

59
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:47,340
monthly get-togethers were drinking and
and having a good time they used to do

60
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,760
annual offsites we would all go one year
we all went up to New York City and you

61
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,190
know basically a giant party for weekend
as with my last small company experience

62
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:07,680
that ended this was significantly more
painful in my mind and again a large

63
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,919
company kind of killed the atmosphere
but it also unlike the first acquisition

64
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,580
it killed a lot of benefits and really

65
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,530
all my work remains the same and what i
was doing wasn't any different it was a

66
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:30,960
in that situation it was a lot of a lot
of it was who always working for that

67
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,650
was more my problem than what I was
doing

68
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm and I'll kind of get into some of my
stuff later so that leaves me up to

69
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:49,139
modern history or is present-day so now
I got out of DC I moved to Tennessee I

70
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,930
work for i will say an average to large
sized company but the benefit is we have

71
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,889
a small security team and they still
have a pretty small company atmosphere

72
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:02,129
and I have worked love to do

73
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:08,610
I'm in a place that I enjoy for more and
so because of that you know I've I'm a

74
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,669
much happier individual i'm relatively
speaking

75
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:20,580
so now that I've gone through all that
reveal what is work-life balance so you

76
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,099
know I think there's kind of two ways to
look at it right

77
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,770
I'm a lot of people consider you know
trying to trying to find that balance

78
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,060
between your work life your personal
life for me I feel like it's a lot of

79
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:37,469
trying to balance balances things but
also balance the stress right there's a

80
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:40,949
lot of stress that comes associated with
with both work and with both our

81
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:46,650
personal lives and so trying to find
ways to balance that so that you know we

82
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:56,698
so the things so that life in general
isn't more enjoyable experience i just i

83
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,759
do together some numbers because i was
sitting around and you know trying to

84
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,120
figure out you know how do you is there
a way to just like quantify it and I

85
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,080
mean you can see there there's how much
over time we spend at work i do think

86
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,359
comes into play i don't think i'd like
to think most people are putting in 20

87
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,460
80 or more hours a year for work

88
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,859
I'd like to think you're working less
and government contracts the that was

89
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,009
the one nice thing about government
contracting work most government

90
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,670
contracts cat the number of hours that

91
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,510
infinite build which meant it was really
hard for you to work more than eighteen

92
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,760
sixty you got 1860 hours you're done
like they couldn't put you on a contract

93
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,569
anymore they couldn't get to the
contract anymore without approvals and

94
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,110
so that was one nice thing about that
right because i knew at the end of the

95
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:54,770
day that 1860 works out to roughly about
3-4 weeks leave plus ten with ten

96
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:01,939
federal holidays so it's that's probably
more reasonable number for what I try to

97
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,830
keep targeted as far as how much I want
to work and I think that's a big part of

98
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:13,400
it even if you even if you love your job
at still work and all of my current job

99
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,689
but it's still my job and there's still
things like to do that aren't related to

100
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,780
my job and I like to have as much time
as possible to do is like I said there's

101
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,610
a lot of stress in our lives right

102
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:32,090
there's their stress from both work and
you know and and a personalized but the

103
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,300
thing to remember about stresses that it
takes a bit can take a big toll on its

104
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,829
rightful physically and mentally having
gone through that you know in the past

105
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:50,960
for me the the physical part was
probably not as bad as the mental I mean

106
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,640
I'm sure probably had slightly higher
blood pressure and and you know and and

107
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,180
stuff like that from from from a
physical perspective but for me it was a

108
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,349
lot more mental it was very draining
being instruct being in the stressful

109
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:11,210
environments i was in and so it it
impacted kind of my you know my desire

110
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,470
to do other things normally when we had
you know what free time we did have I

111
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,790
wanted to spend doing very specific
things and wasn't as keen on going and

112
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:26,120
doing other things I might not have been
inclined to do including going out with

113
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,690
friends and stuff like that i would
rather spend more time kind of doing

114
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,170
stuff around our house you know doing
some of the other things i enjoy doing

115
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,209
so it kinda was also a little isolating
and of itself

116
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:48,550
so you know is that there's the quote
find you know there's many variations on

117
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,699
you find something you enjoy doing and
you know you never work a day in your

118
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,600
life

119
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,770
it's only a partially true statement now
don't get me wrong if you're in a job

120
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,529
you hate your going to be miserable
there's nothing I can do about that or

121
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:04,510
you can do about that if you're in a job
you really enjoy though it does make a

122
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,819
big difference and so having a job you
enjoy is important but you know there's

123
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,140
a lot of other factors that come into
that you know even though there's work

124
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,520
that you may enjoy and might like doing
the people you're working with who

125
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,630
you're working for

126
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:27,100
I'm can i would say have a pretty big
impact on all that there's just a normal

127
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,490
life stresses you know the reality is
you know we have stress that comes along

128
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,110
with having friends having family you
know they can be both benefit our

129
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,440
friends and families can both be
benefits and sometime hindrances but you

130
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:52,120
know it's all about you know looking at
the looking at what looking at how those

131
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,020
things impact you and what they're doing
so I guess that takes me kind of to how

132
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:08,890
do you find your balance so so really
you know when you're trying to find your

133
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:14,140
balance you need to be looking at you
know is trying to find ways to minimize

134
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:24,819
that stress and and also looking at ways
to ways to you know find get the maximum

135
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,690
enjoyment what time you do have you know
what your free time is and so you know

136
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,040
for me it's it's about a big part of it
is you know trying to find what your

137
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,790
priorities are from both work in a life
perspective right so

138
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,779
you know when you go to find your work
priorities you know you want to find a

139
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:47,189
job you know you might have you no pay
maybe a consideration the work you're

140
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:53,969
doing you know benefits and stuff like
that but you know you want a job you

141
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,199
enjoy right and you know we have to
imagine Usain Bolt enjoys his job right

142
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,670
i mean the man can run a race and be
smiling at you know the camera while

143
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,939
beating everybody but it's very it's
very much trying to identify what's

144
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:15,360
important for you right so what do you
want out of a job you know for me for me

145
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,399
that was you know a lot of it was where
I was working when i was doing that was

146
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,300
a big reason why i left the DC area for
me that environment alone was a big

147
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,959
stressor and and I knew what kind of
work like to do I knew what I wanted and

148
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,410
I wanted a company that you know
supported support my ability to come to

149
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,219
events like this and wasn't gonna be a
hindrance to me attending conferences

150
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,529
speaking at conferences so those are all
things i considered when I was looking

151
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:52,410
and so I think that's you know when you
go and you're looking at you know what

152
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,149
how do i find that balance you know if
it's if there's things in your current

153
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:01,679
job or in your current life situation
that make that difficult than looking at

154
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,709
these priorities and saying what are the
most important items is is the beginning

155
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,279
of trying to you know move into a
situation where you're going to have a

156
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,749
better balance

157
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:17,999
um you know you need to find your
personal priorities you know it's going

158
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:23,100
to vary from person to person right a
single guy who doesn't have you know a

159
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,410
family is going to have much different
priorities and a guy who is married and

160
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,230
has three kids at home right

161
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,649
you know the guy with kids probably has
more likely don't want to spend a lot

162
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,799
more time with his kids and be there for
his kids growing up the single guy you

163
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:41,339
know probably wants that more time for
friends more time for hanging out you

164
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:48,179
know whatever debauchery single men do
now it is um so you know for me find my

165
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,839
priorities really you know

166
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,550
first was more free time right that more
time for me to do things I enjoy playing

167
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,740
with my Legos playing with my xbox you
know working on Arduino projects doing

168
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,200
you know I still do security research in
my free time and I think that was one of

169
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,540
the one of the things that the total
cost brought in our conversation on

170
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,790
Twitter was you know that she felt like
do work life balance was a possible

171
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,469
because a lot of a spend free time doing
research and security and stuff like

172
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,510
that and I think what I think what kind
of bothered me about that statement was

173
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:32,420
as if you feel like your hobby as a job
or part of your job then it's not a

174
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,490
hobby anymore

175
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,680
there's a clear delineation between what
I do for security research and what I do

176
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,620
in my day-to-day some of what I do in my
you know and research may wind up

177
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:53,390
overlapping with my work but I don't let
it define me and if I get tired of if

178
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,880
though if the research I'm doing becomes
too intertwined with my work then you

179
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,640
know I need I just need to move on to
something else I don't let those things

180
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,110
I try to keep those things very distinct
and separate and so in that regard even

181
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:13,340
though i work in security i'm a pen
tester for me to go do research on other

182
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,060
things in my mind takes me a lot of
times I'm going and looking at stuff and

183
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,839
security kind of outside of my normal
realm of what I'm doing on a day-to-day

184
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:27,500
basis so I try I try very hard to
separate those that's one of things you

185
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:33,200
know I feel like you know since we do
have that overlap a lot of times but

186
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,270
some people do you know feel like it's
just going from work into their personal

187
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,530
lives

188
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:45,020
I wanted more times of friends you know
going to conferences hang out with

189
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,480
everybody you know I always enjoy coming
getting to see people you know being

190
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,460
able you know mr. before not going to
necessarily go out you know last week

191
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,260
you know going out with friends who came
down into nashville and hanging out like

192
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,490
I will you know to a year and a half two
years ago when I was little

193
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,150
in DC I would have had very little
motivation to want to go out and go do

194
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:14,270
that just because of the situation so
that's been a big that's been a big part

195
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,410
of the change from airing so some people
are going to ask

196
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:25,459
aren't you an angry guy and you know i
gave it i gave a Twitter example i do

197
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,559
tweet a lot i do that a lot on Twitter I
do swear a lot of the fact i've gotten

198
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,139
this far as presentation that a
significant swear words pretty

199
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:41,120
impressive i I've you on a daily basis i
use all seven George Karl's very words

200
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:50,959
I'm so you know it's yes I'm very angry
but in my mind uh those angry statements

201
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,610
and that for me is a lot of release and
it's not letting it all the pent-up

202
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,750
alright let leaving stuff be picked up

203
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:07,189
can can create more problems right and
it i feel like that's what before there

204
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,090
was a period where I let a lot of those
things build up and they never really

205
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,399
ended and very violent eruptions of
anger and rage which were pleasant to be

206
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,320
around and weren't necessarily good for
me physically because I sometimes hurt

207
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:29,450
myself when I punch things not people
things so i found that leaving letting

208
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:35,720
those little things and just getting
shit out of the way when it happens has

209
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,040
helped me a lot

210
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,920
you know it reminds me a lot of there's
a old scene from Family Guy where you

211
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,540
know Brian looks at us and says do you
see you know basis as you know countries

212
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,830
they stop and think geez sometimes you
know got married to that guy and she

213
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,149
goes no I just press it and Brian goes
is that healthy and then there's like a

214
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,600
Peter's voice singing as I I'm a tumor
in her brain

215
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,000
you know it's it's all sorts of things
like I try not to let I try not to let

216
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,030
the stress and those things build up
because you know it just feels like when

217
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,500
you let those things build up they lead
to either more stress down the line or

218
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
you know more health issues down the
line

219
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,639
like i said yes i can come off pretty
angry but it's all relative

220
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,890
at least it wasn't doing for me so I
know kind of throwing a lot of

221
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,210
information about what I've done and
some of the things I've done in finding

222
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:42,050
you know work-life balance and so I
intentionally try to leave a lot of time

223
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,309
in here for questions because i figured
that they would probably be some and

224
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:52,520
also you know to kind of expand on any
of the topics discussed if anybody you

225
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,760
know wanted to so does anybody have any
questions

226
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:01,100
nobody is going to be a silent room
cheese guys hold on

227
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:09,770
no nobody ok sorry I i logged into the
live stream so people on the livestream

228
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,150
could ask me questions too

229
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,150
yes sir

230
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:28,100
no I mean one of the things for me
especially when I was little I've been

231
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:33,320
doing jobs is one of the in inevitable
downfalls to most places I've worked as

232
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,600
i get bored in my job

233
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,449
one of the reasons that the job at my
one of my first jobs which I no word

234
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,210
from a lot for a lot of people and
security policy sounds boring as heck

235
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,440
right you're doing you know validations
and you're doing assessments and going

236
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,640
to check boxes to test products but for
me pour the reason that was very

237
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,770
interesting job and why I stayed in it
for six years was the variance and what

238
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,580
I saw

239
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:07,790
so one week we would be doing
assessments with network devices the

240
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,480
next we could be software one week you
may be doing smartcards actually maybe

241
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,380
doing hardware security modules and so

242
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:20,890
doing those different things working on
those different projects I was and I was

243
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:27,100
still doing a lot of a big part of that
was also code review and I you know for

244
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,669
me part of it was I got to see a lot of
code that you know outside of the

245
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:38,110
organizations that we were working with
people didn't see a lot of that code so

246
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:44,050
it was kind of cool to be able to do a
lot of that and actually was when I

247
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,879
really started to learn and you know I
got a lot of information about

248
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,690
cryptography then so i would say I
probably have more than most average

249
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,860
person's but I'm nowhere near like a
cryptographer level but it was very much

250
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:04,479
an interesting time to kind of learn and
expand whereas my last pentesting job I

251
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,520
enjoyed it a lot but it felt because of
the process and the methods that we used

252
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,900
in that in that organization it felt
very repetitive it felt like we were

253
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,200
doing the same things over and over and
part because we're probably find we were

254
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,060
spending the same things over and over
within our networks so far have not seen

255
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,740
that issue in our and my current job
you're doing internal pentesting you

256
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,080
might think oh god it get boring really
quick

257
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,149
you know the current company i work for
has a very big network we have lots of

258
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,830
applications and so far it's been very
interesting kind of doing one thing to

259
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:44,800
another and i'm still learning stuff so
you know I don't worry as much about it

260
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,300
as I did in my last job where it felt
like we everybody on the team had a very

261
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,629
specific role and nobody went outside of
their little scope of the role of Palms

262
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,530
me

263
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,960
ah so that's been a big part of it for
me

264
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,200
um yeah yeah sure

265
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:26,269
so you know for me you know someone over
time and I kind of decided this I think

266
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:30,590
sometime during my last job

267
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:35,689
um you know I know that I eventually I'm
gonna lead down to a path of management

268
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:43,640
i do i've done it twice in my career now
and I I've honestly enjoyed it

269
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:50,929
helping to develop new people helping
them kind of grow from you know from

270
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:57,169
entry-level folks and become more more
senior talent over time was actually a

271
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,559
very filling process for me so i know
that something I'm kind of working

272
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,260
towards and that's another part of
reason why I took the job that I'm in

273
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:09,769
now is because you know right now we're
a team of one on pen testing but there

274
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:15,200
was no knowledge when i interviewed that
you know we would be growing the team

275
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,029
that had basically have a lot of input
and how that team gets built and so

276
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:24,409
because of that you know I'm not
basically that was a big reason for

277
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:29,899
taking the my current job was that I
wanted to be able to find people that I

278
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:34,129
wanted to work with and be able to help
them grow and develop the skills and

279
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,539
become pen testers and if you know they
work for us if you know in the future if

280
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:42,889
they work force for a year to move on to
you know even bigger better things great

281
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:49,039
you know I want people like to see
people you know succeed at least the

282
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,330
ones who seek the help and want to to
learn and so for me that's been a big

283
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:59,990
part of kind of where my where I feel
like my future and the field is

284
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:27,789
yeah right i think so right if if you
were working for one company and going

285
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:31,870
from one contract to another I feel like
that nobody could fault you if you you

286
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,379
know like trying to be stagnant I
definitely think where people talk about

287
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,429
moving from one company to another one
job to another I sometimes feel as an

288
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:44,260
overrated statement and it looks at a
very narrow scope of it right you know

289
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,908
some people I've met people who are
older than me who are perfectly content

290
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:54,909
being senior seniors and lead developers
or testers and they don't want any part

291
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:57,820
to do with management they don't like
dealing with it they don't like dealing

292
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,439
with you know the things associated with
it especially if they have to do the HR

293
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,570
side of things and so do but they're
good at what they do and they're going

294
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,769
to keep doing it

295
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:15,279
I'm oh so you know I feel like everyone
used to look at their own situation and

296
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,240
I was trying and try not to get hung up
on these like theories and believes that

297
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,610
everybody has about what is and isn't
you know acceptable for helping somebody

298
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:29,649
in their career so I'd like to take more
questions but I'm kind of up against the

299
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:34,870
time so i will put my contact
information if anybody does have any
