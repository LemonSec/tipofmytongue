1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
good important goal

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,780
alright so I'm right berman from black
theory is my handle on the bottom Eric

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:17,698
all be on Twitter and my partner and I
easy we're pretty much but it is it's

4
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,010
designed to give you guys a general
overview of how to get filled by you

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,930
guys all experts but you know kind of
seems like filled with a lot of people

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,910
want to get into that are quite sure how
to and so I such we're going to talk

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,078
about today who could not enough

8
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,360
ok it's ok louder alright let's get
started

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:53,789
oh my Brian course their pride and
playing so make sure degrees and things

10
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,500
wat smokers what I do today mostly
security analyst researcher pastor and I

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,159
get to work with those three awesome
guys who just spoke for me really happy

12
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,430
about work for John also amazing cat
videos so if you guys have a great video

13
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:19,650
send them to me and I love good cavity
or send them over so why should we care

14
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,820
about hardware

15
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,809
well one of the things a lot of people
out all the same devices a lot of these

16
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,729
devices so if I start picking some of
these things up like that even even with

17
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,060
the just about it you guys are organized
with those of you guys probably seen

18
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,979
that right well the thing is a lot of
companies also have these exact same

19
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,460
devices a lot of corporations use the
exact same devices from company to

20
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,169
company and the thing is that these
devices are like pieces of software not

21
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,030
operating systems they don't receive
updates as frequently and so a lot of

22
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,960
times when these products have put out
you'll find a little back doors to get

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,960
put out or you know administration for
you no call for companies to play around

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,539
with

25
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:08,259
so for instance i got this is a docsis
modem thing here you know stuff like

26
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:13,540
that and so the thing is is we just need
to know how to look for these little

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,359
mysteries little treetops probably fine
and so again just before we get going

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,630
what i mean by hardware well i'm talking
about a lot of these devices that I have

29
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,750
up here talking about your router's
talking about your motives

30
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,050
maybe he falls for your car which i hope
we still have in my pocket

31
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,420
yes okay cool i'm a lossy shadows
actually worried about that smart home

32
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,410
devices this is another big one so we're
talking about like master i would talk

33
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,820
about security devices especially things
like didn't you guys read about it in

34
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,470
the company yeah those guys coming her
asking all the time so things like that

35
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,180
and additionally smart grid devices so
now we're looking at houses that are

36
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,070
getting these devices put on them so the
power companies can remotely control you

37
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,390
know shut down your door and I demand
energy systems during peak hours of the

38
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:08,109
day so that's what we're talking about
the harbor and so what good is do well

39
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,250
imagine you're on a test and you're
looking at the devices that are

40
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,239
available on this company you find out
they have a public-facing device that

41
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,860
ends up being a router you find out what
type of router this is so what can you

42
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,489
do

43
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,410
well go on by the same model router more
than likely that's going to be available

44
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,950
I mean a lot of times this isn't soft
quiet area equipment that only one

45
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,250
company owns is going to something that
you can go out and you can buy yourself

46
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,750
go out grab it and start playing around
with it and maybe play around with it

47
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,970
and find out that inside of it there's
this account we're out and it doesn't

48
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:49,299
get changed by default so now you might
have a way i want you

49
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:53,200
how can we actually go about doing this
happened pull their credit you standard

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,548
protocols that are built into different
devices and a lot of times when these

51
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,239
devices get manufacturer they get put
out of the production line these

52
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,860
protocols are actually left over some
companies disabled then i'll show you

53
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,620
guys when I hope

54
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,430
couple these pieces of hardware they try
to do that but a lot of times these are

55
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,409
locked open the thing is it's not always
apparent if you go back and look at some

56
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:19,190
older devices it is a lot more apparent
I've actually I was over to a friend's

57
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,479
house so I couple months ago and i
started he had like an old box those

58
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,620
possible equipment like most of us do
and i started looking through it and

59
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,330
sure enough a lot of those devices is
literally labeled what protocols are but

60
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,949
that's not always pays

61
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:40,789
however we do have some tools that can
help us along with this process so what

62
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:45,050
are some of the protocols will look at
here well sure the main product balls

63
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,870
are a tad so join test action group and
also you are almost universal

64
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,190
asynchronous received transmit also
known as many as a serial type of

65
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,419
communication so jtagging in 10

66
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:03,169
no Jack I've never actually watched the
show but that's the best I could come up

67
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:11,270
with those so jtag this is this is a
really good one upon if you can find us

68
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,320
and you can you can interface for this
is fantastic because a lot of times it's

69
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,010
used for debugging and programming the
hardware sizes hardware comes off the

70
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,789
line baby testing the hardware use a
glass in the front where you can

71
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,690
actually use it for debugging as well to
you so you can look into this interface

72
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,560
a lot of times you can run the software
that song on this piece of art from

73
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,789
former sorry and you can step through
line by line what's going on you can see

74
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:40,070
the bodies remembering all the stuff and
it was actually running on the chokes on

75
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:46,789
the hardware itself and in some cases we
can actually use this protocol this jet

76
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:50,539
pack protocol to dump off the firmware
so we can grab them from where the

77
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:57,979
device itself we can dump it off and we
can start inspecting it and so what can

78
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,880
we find it as well sometimes you can
find things like passwords in clear-text

79
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,340
we can find private so you know ssh-keys
encryption keys you can find all this

80
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,929
stuff in there may be some endpoints on
the web

81
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,889
device with which devices communicating
and so you can go out and play around

82
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,759
with those endpoints you would have
other else otherwise found and see

83
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,360
what's there may be some backdoor you
know tell them to open maybe it's open

84
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,930
on a different port and you what you
would expect all these things you can go

85
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,979
and you can look at other things you
might be able to do on so maybe you're

86
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,508
not necessarily looking to attack some
remote device but maybe you have a

87
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,479
device and you wanted to do something a
little bit differently than what it's

88
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:38,440
supposed to do

89
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,820
well if you can get ahold of a jtag
interface you can actually hold firm off

90
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,469
potentially modified firmware and flash
it back on now you can have it kind of

91
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,889
you know reprogram its speed

92
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:56,860
what are you are well this one's pretty
often defined as well too because a lot

93
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,229
of times if you can find aur interface
you will get a straight-up console on

94
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:06,490
the device a lot of times this console
is not password protective you drop

95
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,940
right into a root shell and you can
start playing around with exploring

96
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:16,240
which I'll show you guys on one of these
devices coming up bubs

97
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,080
yeah it's another thing to play around
with with partner happy to do this so we

98
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,609
need to look into all software defined
radio SDR and i'm going to talk about

99
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,320
that at the end of this presentation I'm
not to go too much into it I'm going .

100
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,680
you guys references so you guys how to
get started on it and then you can go

101
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,720
out and go nuts

102
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,630
so what are some different tools we
should get there's quite a few different

103
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:47,380
things that I that I suggest a lot of
these devices are actually pretty I know

104
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,840
it seems a little bit intimidating at
first but there's something different

105
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,229
about calculator starting out pretty
much played this before this is by a guy

106
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,349
named Joe Graham from grand ideas
studios

107
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:03,940
this one's really good really nice for
help me to bind the you are and jtag of

108
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,310
places i think mine might be a little
bit funny side of the road

109
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,380
I over what but we can still use a
release one of the demos today what is

110
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:22,830
some of the other things closed so the
next one okay so some of the other

111
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,060
specialty devices besides the calculator
so if you calculate what it's going to

112
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,610
do a lot of you find you are a regular
basis so we say we find a jtag interface

113
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,010
what do we do next well couple different
things we have what's called the bus

114
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,809
pirate which is good for our computers
and things not just a tad but just

115
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:46,829
barely cheat and pretty pretty easy to
play around with it looks going to open

116
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:53,700
OCD another one which i haven't actually
played around with you up but I've read

117
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,780
good things from another device are
fairly inexpensive pick up this was

118
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,439
supposed to be a little more above
robust the boss pirate want to show on

119
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,090
the bus part is that they're really easy
Rick I have like six of these things now

120
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,650
on three of them are no longer working
for whatever reason they stopped on

121
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,650
so you've got to be really really really
careful with these guys

122
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,450
yes sir

123
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:29,370
what's all this is this about you 30
bucks this across to you

124
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,730
45 bucks this once the marks pensive on
which we're hoping it didn't break for

125
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,100
this wash about iron 75 so I am working
on something I'm not going to give away

126
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,400
too many details but i'm trying to make
kind of roll these all into something

127
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:51,540
it's going to our possibilities are you
so staging bit so that's rough red ball

128
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,810
on what other things should look at

129
00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:03,900
well a lot of little bit and so one of
the things like a game show host for

130
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,199
this

131
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:21,290
I going to solder i personally like my
trusty Weller making really really can't

132
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,319
see what's out there any work they
called my free workstations you can get

133
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,820
go out span a couple hundred dollars you
want to get something pretty cool what I

134
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,240
suggest not doing is not going to
walmart by the one for like twenty bucks

135
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,080
that's hardly a soldering gun in my
opinion it's just a piece about its

136
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:43,610
really off Bob that's about it but this
thing is that under 500 boxes what I got

137
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,180
from it and store and treated by our
office actually cheaper

138
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:54,739
this one's the the w/e s51 that had a
thing for seven years now and I've never

139
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,030
had a problem with that I for the same
serious abuse it looks old school

140
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,970
because it is it's been around for a
while but it if you have something that

141
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,600
works

142
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:10,700
no reason to change up so highly highly
suggest one of these what else did you

143
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,660
get to go with that

144
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:19,760
well sometimes just for the soldering
station so I so you'll notice on the

145
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,350
bottom of this has this little square
that's meant to be for a damned spot

146
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:32,270
that's what we do that somebody showed
me one of these so these things are

147
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,650
frickin awesome

148
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,699
he's up on amazon i can't remember it
was called basically it's just some

149
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,350
metal stuff in there and you just stick
the soldering iron in there and just

150
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:49,460
clean it off and it's nice to have to go
down Spanish fantastic so that's out

151
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:55,430
what else do I don't have my station so
something like this is gonna be pretty

152
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,810
handy to this is called helping hands
you get a magnifying boss you can take a

153
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,130
closer look at what your soldering and
also we need to solder like two wires

154
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,480
together this thing is going to stick
them in there it's on it's great this

155
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,200
thing is awesome i was just that what
else

156
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:25,540
I stress going on getting up on show
these so these are ok

157
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:40,870
oh no tengo sweet alright just getting
their mail and wire email email email

158
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,680
you can pick up giant accident i should
just going out just getting a bunch of

159
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,680
those really really helpful

160
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,880
it's really weird

161
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:06,579
alright what other things definitely
multimeter go out and get yourself one

162
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,260
of these I pick this thing up for like
20 bucks from war i had another one like

163
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,550
it which i also have the same feller it
just finally crapped out on me a couple

164
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,640
months ago I had to go by anyone but you
have twenty bucks

165
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,390
this thing is fantastic i mean they make
other ones that are good too but this is

166
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,990
really all you need basically the main
features will need to just the voltage

167
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,760
feature on the homes and continuity so
the continuity child to tell you

168
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,030
basically are two things connective you
get that lovely sound God get one of

169
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:44,439
these go all of us what other autumns
security bits

170
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,260
I don't even know why they call security
that's because you can just go to

171
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,960
Harvard great pick up these things for
five bucks that's it and your act done

172
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,760
right all right about some screwdrivers
or it

173
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,290
these things I picked up online for
about five boxes are pretty happy you

174
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,140
got like a giant set of them on just a
little

175
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,040
these are things different shapes sizes
all i get stopped by home box

176
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:16,960
what kind of solder do I use when I got
this one from radioshack also around

177
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,410
telling how long this will last you if
you just going to pick something up

178
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:26,860
so this one is a 60-40 rocky core solder
points 0 32 inch diameter and he doesn't

179
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:33,220
want it all matter all that much but I'm
67 bucks whatever what else are always

180
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,280
keeps on my stories here and move on

181
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,329
so one of these so this is just kind of
a little bit of the gospel got this

182
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,130
great basically just tiny little
screwdrivers in a little pics and stuff

183
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:52,480
Marisol to think this was notified your
inbox get yourself a good pair of

184
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,170
clippers

185
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,760
that's what i call this just a little
nice and then a good pair of strippers

186
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,920
so really all part for most of these
little odds and ends here i mean

187
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,880
probably maybe like a hundred box or so
for all the other box on the soldering

188
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:14,110
iron iron sorry everyone always makes
fun of it is about iron alright is one

189
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,620
of these two little bread board without
a little bread board either

190
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,449
alright that's all stuff seems like a
lot of stuff but honestly if you just go

191
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:26,230
on Amazon and you searched around you
get that absolutely terrible light you

192
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,380
might also be interested and so you
start out wanting your heart by the time

193
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,860
you got 20 things in your heart and I
scope management

194
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:39,790
alright moving on that's all the stuff
right so what about the SDR on highly

195
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,660
suggest hat all right one then has to
str device

196
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,280
I don't have it with me but if you want
to do STR stuff highly I was just going

197
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,579
out and getting one of those and what
we'll talk about that a little bit later

198
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,740
software

199
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,360
what do we use for that so typically a
bunch of type OS or reality is what

200
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,890
we're going to use here I up basic
serial console so you can screen is many

201
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:08,980
Tom whatever you ever open OCD if you're
going to do the jtag stuff they want to

202
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:18,280
draw gravel LCD I've been walking a new
radio what else happened after look that

203
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,569
says I stole your chair

204
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,610
what are you going to do about it

205
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:30,519
alright so let's do a quick like demo
here fire extinguisher one of only half

206
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,029
joking about video poker good fish

207
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,430
alright got that up so boarded up

208
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:19,089
alright so we're gonna look at the soul
router device that got on again this is

209
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,839
just stop it i'm laying around my house
is our game should and the sort of

210
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,990
started going around all that stop this
my wife going to get rid of a long time

211
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:32,679
ago just like yeah right you gotta we
gotta . purposes now so we got this one

212
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:35,679
slaughtered and let me by

213
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,700
alright so what are some of the things
are looking for what we're trying to

214
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,940
find these interfaces on something
you'll see a lot

215
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:53,530
all right you can see that you'll find
these quite a bit so those almost always

216
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:59,049
are going to be for you are facts
whether or not they're enabled is a

217
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:03,879
different story but either way these are
going to be things you want to look for

218
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:20,490
it's possible that they might come in
slightly different forms so rather than

219
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:26,309
my holes might have something like this
or just pass a little out there

220
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:35,039
see they're over here as well you right
here again after you see the holes so

221
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:51,900
it's going to be things are going to
look look for something else that's not

222
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:59,850
a bad idea how much better than idea to
grab are these our heads but sometimes

223
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,918
you get lucky the device but most time
it's not and so once you find these

224
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,690
interfaces especially if it's like a
through bolt so it's all water place you

225
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,140
can go ahead and make things easier and
go ahead and just saw her on your own

226
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:21,809
your own letters back richer for it so
here on Thomas interface if you look

227
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:26,580
real close so you see that actually have
54 holes but i'm only father for free so

228
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,449
if you look really close with it's
really hard to see with this era but you

229
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,980
actually notice that only three out of
five of those up here to be connected so

230
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,299
you look on the board and that's really
hard to say

231
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:43,740
basically you'll see little lines to go
from the holster it places on the board

232
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,360
those are all races and if you don't see
me race is going from the holes it

233
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,850
doesn't necessarily mean there isn't
anything connected it could be a

234
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,899
multi-layer board and you just can't see
him but in this case this is just a

235
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,460
cheap single-layer bored so I knew that
only three out of these five are

236
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:07,980
actually effective this one had decided
up some cutters to those pins to those

237
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,980
holes

238
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:22,070
all right call

239
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:42,110
so next up find my wires all right so
I'm gonna know you guys probably put

240
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,280
that camera is just terrible can debug
so the next thing that the center

241
00:20:46,280 --> 00:21:14,570
gravity wires here five minutes and
she's ones that are not Joe ok gotta

242
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:22,639
plug down and looking directly into the
calculator if you want to i would like

243
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,990
to do is I want to use the argues the
breadboard is kind of like a military

244
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:32,810
base just makes it a little bit less
likely they were going to rip out the

245
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:41,899
bottle stock from the board and give you
a little bit more freedom and enter ok

246
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,620
fires here and my headers wires on the
breadboard

247
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:32,680
Marshall small part part call so now I'm
the way the redwoods work is that you

248
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,660
have all the power in the ground rail so
basically this whole rails connected

249
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,200
anything any one of these holes on the
red line connected together any one of

250
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,710
these falls on the blue line is
connected together have and then

251
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:50,380
otherwise is these rows going by numbers
so going this way so that bloody knees

252
00:22:50,380 --> 00:23:17,980
and like that these are all connected
together now i'm going to come over to

253
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:32,170
my ID tag later are so this

254
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,620
alright so calculator we have different
channels basically 24 different channels

255
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:45,280
we can play around it and also have
round and we have a voltage so I'm gonna

256
00:23:45,280 --> 00:24:01,230
plug these into channels 20 through 22

257
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:07,500
all right call

258
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:18,059
so one final day common ground

259
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,450
this is something that will drive you
nuts if you don't pay attention to it

260
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:28,620
basically I'll with electronics we have
a cold ground reference so we're looking

261
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,689
at voltage that voltage is in reference
to some other point and this point it is

262
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,110
ground we're talking about the ground
the ground reference for both these

263
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:40,799
devices are they need to have a palm
ground otherwise this isn't going to

264
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,679
work correctly i'm going to work out
quite the way that you hoped it would

265
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:53,580
and so I'm gonna get common ground by
the ways of you on these power adapters

266
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:04,620
the power adapter is almost always have
this little have tried switching

267
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:14,340
backboard like that so I've already
soldered on ground about being a little

268
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,299
power doctor here our foot on the side
of it is almost always going to be metal

269
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,960
tab it's almost always going to drop
granddaughter of a wire to that solder

270
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,919
solder whatever you want it doesn't
really matter but that allow you to get

271
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,919
a common ground between digit calculator
and this device sir

272
00:25:47,030 --> 00:26:25,070
ok call so next I'm going to do I'm
going to plug in my router hopefully not

273
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:33,889
let out the magic smoke all right when
he likes good sign right so let's go

274
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:45,890
take this camera opposites we're saying
i'm going to go ahead and plug energy

275
00:26:45,890 --> 00:27:02,660
calculators just a little mini micro USB
connector are it and it looks like a

276
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,510
connected that's good and again as you
can see this will be M you don't have to

277
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:17,480
have a dedicated of us and now you can
use on or whatever out your protocol you

278
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,590
want radius as many common

279
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:37,259
so Steve + tab you want us to be 0 it's
going to give it AB operate for the

280
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:43,799
regulator it's a 115 to Hunter hey we're
connected we don't see anything

281
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,990
there's a sweet splash screen so there's
a little reset button on here you going

282
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:56,039
to hit the reset button get the awesome
little ask the are you later alright so

283
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:04,019
once you're in here we do something like
first I'm going to control a Z so you're

284
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:09,360
lazy will bring up this of calm so
there's quite a few different options of

285
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:17,758
what i'm going to do is turn off local
echo which is capital e put off so i

286
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:24,480
hope and you can see we have general
fans may have managed to our mats and so

287
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,059
read it first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go ahead and type de so i set the

288
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:35,789
voltage level and we're going to 3.3
almost devices are going to play around

289
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,720
with it probably going to be 3.3 volts
you might run into someone . tables of

290
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,279
devices but for the most part they're
probably going to be 3.3 volt so now I

291
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:49,230
said 3.3 volt what's the next thing i
want to do well let's go ahead and

292
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,830
already know the answer this one but was
tried to see if there's a gate and face

293
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:07,769
so that's 4.jpg interfaces got the itv2
options here I code and my ass the ID

294
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,730
code is a quick way to determine if
there's potentially a jtag interface on

295
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,629
the device

296
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:16,230
it won't give you all the panels but at
least tell you is there possibly an

297
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,260
interface here it'll be quick i won't
give you all the information

298
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,320
but it'll actually know if you should
use the smaller option which is the

299
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,790
bypass can on the bypass can we'll go
ahead and give you all just takes a

300
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,629
little bit longer

301
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,430
normal you want to run the numbers for
the ID code in this case I have three

302
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:40,170
channels to remember i hook up three
wires through and nothing you did find

303
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,490
something here you go ahead and hit be
many beyond checking out to see whether

304
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:54,030
it was the rest of us are all right next
we're going to look for you are so you

305
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,080
can see for the you are man we have you
or identify you are and we have tea for

306
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,490
the you are a sir

307
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:06,660
so what's going on to you and here we
can give it a string is just like to do

308
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:16,920
test it with the number of channels
3-space party began to start writing

309
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,370
through this

310
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:25,439
nothing alright so if you do this and
you don't get anything on you are

311
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,060
portion don't be discouraged

312
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:33,030
don't give up it doesn't necessarily in
there is anything that walks us how to

313
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:53,190
reset the device now we're going to get
you past three space bar to get are

314
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:58,410
sacrificed a chicken

315
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,100
I did not that might be part of it

316
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:32,100
and I think that out so i think that
some of those bars are used so i have a

317
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,189
step getting a bunch of these because
some of the others that you might run

318
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,960
into will have destroyed the these
portions of the character and look at

319
00:31:39,960 --> 00:32:13,170
least they won't actually make a
connection so I'm okay already wires on

320
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:22,110
that let's try again us i come back out

321
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,680
alright so we got the splash screen i'm
gonna set bolted sweet 132 go ahead and

322
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:36,330
load the gun for the you are testing
testing im gonna do three and then we

323
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:43,980
get this screen here it's going to plug
it in and everyone cross your fingers to

324
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,530
all right

325
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:00,149
alright so i think that is my treat a
greater being broken but have no fear

326
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:23,580
can try two different channels on their
part

327
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,890
so I

328
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:40,190
get up from 0 1 2 & 3 to be on four five
and six so I'm just gonna tell it's

329
00:33:40,190 --> 00:34:42,110
seven channels all right work question
was what does it actually send you on

330
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,040
this is one reason that it's so great a
greater is a great device do not get me

331
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,909
wrong but it does have some down times
especially when attacking you are ranked

332
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:53,840
beside the fact that mine is a little
bit broken even when it's working

333
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,610
correctly all it's doing is it's running
through all permutations of the pan that

334
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,090
I've selected i selected seven channels
it's going to go through and it's going

335
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,930
to pair those off its going to say ok
I'm going to use channel 0 as my

336
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,549
centerline i'm gonna use channel one as
my received why I chose spring testing

337
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,560
if you can see up there call it will
send out that string and will look to

338
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,970
see if you receive that screen back so
it's going to send that testing string

339
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,810
over the transmit walk and it's going to
look at the receiving line and what ok

340
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:29,420
did I get anything back something in my
little crazy when you're doing this is

341
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:34,400
not some devices you might have you are
protocol but it might just be that you

342
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,050
aren't able to actually essential

343
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,130
send character to that kind of scrutiny
to receive them back so you might run

344
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:49,980
this and a lot of times we'll likely see
stuff like this to see this come back .

345
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,710
about g ? you'll see a bunch of stuff
that is not what you sacked again do not

346
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,880
get discouraged that does not mean that
you don't have you are that you can

347
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,300
interface with it it just might mean
that during the time you're standing you

348
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,420
can't necessarily interact with it so if
you see this

349
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,220
be happy be very happy exciting so you
can play around with it a little bit

350
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,850
more and you might be able to actually
interact with it might just take a

351
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,110
little bit of work though

352
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,840
alright so let's roll out now that it's
working alright let's call back

353
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:35,220
question question what if the mo device
does not care back so the question the

354
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,930
question was if it does not follow the
characters back this is jtaggable fail

355
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,129
I'm not necessarily what you'll get is
you get basically what i talked about so

356
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,900
if it's it as long as speed if there's a
serial console ball

357
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,400
are there some kind of you are interface
if it's the device itself is outputting

358
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,530
text as long as you see something coming
back then go you might have to go

359
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,830
investigate a little further it might
not necessarily be the word that you set

360
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:07,200
over because it might happen . exactly
what he said but as long as you see

361
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,770
something that you might want to dive a
little bit for good question

362
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:20,180
alright so scrolling on it

363
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,990
this device because I knew that this one
doesn't go pack which makes things a

364
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,930
little bit easier it will be easier to
show as long as your calculator is

365
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:29,930
working correctly which parent to anyone

366
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:39,230
John so it goes through and you see that
what it what it does is we have this txt

367
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,210
rxd baud rate and the data so this is
telling us which of the channels on a

368
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,500
calculator used or it's actually
backwards so this is saying the

369
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,910
transmitter and the device of the target
device and the receipt and of the target

370
00:37:52,910 --> 00:38:01,670
the bus so here we use five child 550 XD
channel 64 rhd at a moderate of 115 to

371
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,410
monitor this one is pretty common you're
going to see 12 water or 9600 either one

372
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,790
of those us there are other father it's
going to use with your pregnancy 1

373
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:16,759
alright now that i got that I got txt 5r
sd-6 the bond rating 150-200 let's play

374
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,220
around a little bit more

375
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:32,299
break 4 beds3 so now that I've got out
i'm going to use a hit a guy and you are

376
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:37,069
and together we have there are the key
for the you are asteroids what's going

377
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:45,829
to do that to be a dad tells me the new
CFC head which was five large head

378
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:53,210
little sips and moderate which was born
15 now this is there anything at all

379
00:38:53,210 --> 00:39:01,700
like doesn't want you to leave us okay
so max it out let's try that again he so

380
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,960
one nice thing I was a stage of previous
settings so here it tells me by whereas

381
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:16,190
before 10 so I'm just going to hit our
air this way to change 115200 I'm local

382
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,830
echo

383
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:23,480
alright I don't see anything I can't get
anything

384
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:30,830
dang right no again don't be discouraged
leave this open like that much reset the

385
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:35,060
device again here really the same as you
try to turn it all off and back on again

386
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:41,630
like that really really applies not
seriously trying to back off and about

387
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,890
audience

388
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:51,319
what's what's this it's like school is
this happening

389
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,780
yes the right colors

390
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:10,880
alright so what to do at this point is
just to start tiny too much stuff going

391
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,870
on its best

392
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:24,770
okay it's off wait so go ahead and
syntax are over-the-top sweet ok I'm

393
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,720
just going to just just find my keys

394
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,509
it doesn't stop it just puts out my
stuff just keep going and watching

395
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:38,270
please like it almost always work to
practice even know but your YouTube

396
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:38,630
video

397
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:45,260
this way you know here's the average
grade LS o we

398
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:54,740
what is that what is that file so stone
right all right so I around us

399
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,900
no such file directory

400
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:08,060
I don't know that was weird so nothing
to see there are already rude

401
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:14,450
here we are looking out beyond file on
you no te sirve p.m. so i gave you some

402
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:17,660
stuff to work out course just your
standard router on

403
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:22,609
there might be something belong here but
this just to give you an idea right this

404
00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:26,060
is just give me an idea of playing
around these devices you might if you

405
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,910
play around enough with us just using
some of the stuff you might be able to

406
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:32,598
drop into a shell who knows what you're
going to buy that . right but it's

407
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:35,510
really exciting with you I mean after
all that stuff for like dollars are

408
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:38,660
going to work as a kind of work isn't
wait what is that right

409
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:45,349
alright so let's unite video using the
regulator and the URL based on get a lot

410
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:49,460
of times this you'll drop into a console
like this will drop into a console you

411
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,609
won't need a password and you'll be able
to start digging around see what else

412
00:41:52,609 --> 00:42:01,490
you can find any questions on out so far
besides I was not working the program

413
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,200
shell and so that you don't have the
password file and seen I'm documented

414
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,049
accounts back to work it's crazy

415
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:18,109
no not yet but i think that they just
think that was the point of typing all

416
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:25,940
this flow and disorder ride but i found
this one is it will just keep up

417
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,310
so what are the questions i was
appointed type of stuff and what happens

418
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,270
to be just let it run

419
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,750
so if you just let it run on this one
you'll never actually drop into the

420
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:40,339
console title just stop there is at some
point in the script what I'll say it any

421
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:45,049
key to stop the process and that's all
I'm doing they're basically is hiding

422
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,609
stuff until I hit that prompt that kills
the auto group here to let it continue

423
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,240
going it's just going to keep scrolling
stuff and it will never actually drop

424
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,348
your console so basically just killing
the boot process and drop themselves

425
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:01,790
into a possible actually got a component
devices as well guess what round was

426
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:06,950
that test so this was just a linksys
loops

427
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,130
it's also not going to move things
around but then you will let automatics

428
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:25,830
over this one is a cisco don't I have a
serial number here but it's basically

429
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:32,340
two so cheap little cisco router and I
found that I hold of the cisco routers

430
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,120
and with a happy you are interfaces open
so if you want an almost for sure thing

431
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,089
that we're going to drop into it you are
also brought to describe cheeks cool

432
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,390
Robert Hall School cheese surrounding
you're probably dropping possible

433
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,200
questions on any other questions forum

434
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:56,040
all right thank you guys for bearing
with me through the mission is painful

435
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,970
alright so what are some of the other
things you can look at what is sunday

436
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,830
devices i have looked at it's really
sweet guy is this look at it and think

437
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:08,190
about before I started playing around
with hardware hacking go on ebay and

438
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:14,490
order up a bunch of old use hardware so
i ordered on one of these cisco 80 . i

439
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:18,569
choose a lot of places of unison
airports and see this in a lot of other

440
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:23,580
places so however this up i started
playing around with that I got you are

441
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:28,080
in place on it i wasn't able to get a
full consoles where I could play around

442
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:33,360
it but just by watching the stuff scroll
through I found quite interesting things

443
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,260
found this helpful longer hospital they
have sold it off and they haven't

444
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,400
cleared off the Roll information from it
so it still had all their research on it

445
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,510
and other information on as well and
also had these endpoints so as I'm

446
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,080
sitting there watching this information
scroll by see that there's a status that

447
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,430
out of the sand . the response from the
same . ago and just pull it up real

448
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,680
quick to see what's there and turn up
it's a wife

449
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,240
why I want you to play around with so
you never know what you're going to find

450
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,870
if you order all the jihad portion so
the jihad is actually disabled my tea

451
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,870
party in the same carry this picture

452
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,660
but there's the there's the interface
for you gotta line everything was good

453
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,759
until you have been here that's of
solder flux for me playing around with

454
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,970
it but what they do is they actually
removed certain resistors and capacitors

455
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:28,740
so that you can interface with the jtag
protocol honest if you want to solve

456
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,689
those back-end you'll be good to go to
top off whatever is on there and play

457
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,780
around

458
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:42,060
what else here's an example of actually
being able to interface with the jtag

459
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:46,680
protocol so here I have two detectives
are going on this was on a smart meter

460
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,629
which one

461
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:52,109
even though it's separate from the
companies that we're testing for the

462
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:53,790
company who made this device

463
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:58,710
no you cannot actually talk about this
device itself so i'm going to say which

464
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:05,520
one but it is a smart meter and we ran
out of the gate hang on and we found

465
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:11,369
this protocol we found out first up here
is the quick scan that i was talking

466
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:17,430
about that's the ID codes can see that
we get out all the Pens seperti I on so

467
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,450
it identifies these but if you want to
actually interface with that article we

468
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:26,819
need all and so after finding this micro
sweet ok there's a tag call rerun the

469
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:31,290
bypass which is a little bit slower but
that all identify all the plans for you

470
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:41,970
then use the bus part2 actually
interface for those Barton OCD and after

471
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:48,868
doing that Ryan OCD with the best part
it has interfaces quite nicely finds it

472
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:57,329
ok there's stm32 chip on here with that
we can watch you have that open no city

473
00:46:57,329 --> 00:47:01,319
has a nice command actually just jumped
up off the image you can come off within

474
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,490
file permit on from there you can start
playing around with this you can do

475
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:11,040
things like run strings against it in
this case found some 80 commands and

476
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,300
internal communication and points every
packet out there but still fun stuff on

477
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,130
the device you can go and play around
with

478
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:22,650
and the last thing i want to talk about
moving on from the shake-a-lator any

479
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:31,500
questions on a4a about yes sir but if
seen this before a device is waiting for

480
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:37,769
a service light or the black in all
uppercase letters for will do anything

481
00:47:37,769 --> 00:47:44,160
for not only was it potentially so if
you have to know what it's you know what

482
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,308
it's looking more at not any probably
have to write a prescription to start

483
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:48,869
sending over strings

484
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:54,269
once you have been at least found the
it's received line or I'm sorry its

485
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:57,149
transmitted lining that interface and
you might have to start playing around

486
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,599
trying to find its received wine and you
know script up something just hand over

487
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:05,940
a bunch of different pens but another
thing I've seen is where some devices

488
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,450
well they'll sit there and wait for some
kind of a network communication or dhcp

489
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:13,109
before they continue in that case just
plug it into like a rabbit you have or

490
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:19,769
something else to send out the days you
here to get an abortion smart here like

491
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:24,569
something that measuring the gas your
house that kind of a smart meter I'm so

492
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:29,009
smart meter in this case it was also i'm
going to use to essentially shut off

493
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:34,589
high demand devices during heat out of
the mass times condition

494
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:38,220
yes

495
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:47,609
questions questions just couple minutes
left so SDR as i mentioned you want to

496
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:52,200
get a heart wants wanted i suggested a
couple others out there and these books

497
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:58,980
screaming about go out by these books
are very long there and passed it on for

498
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,779
me anyways again took some of the magic
out of radio transmission stuff wrong

499
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:07,319
with these they're just absolutely
fantastic

500
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,730
in addition to the books there's also an
install guide for the new radio which

501
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,380
would be a little bit topic get set up
and it definitely was

502
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:23,590
football check out that link . get you
going alright what else on other things

503
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:27,910
that will help you out with your str
stop is a one of those one of the nice

504
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:32,290
things with the sec is that the required
basically any of these transmitting and

505
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:36,850
receiving devices a registered
information about themselves and this

506
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:41,380
information is publicly available and
can be quite scripted there's a link

507
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:48,460
down there sec aida io if you hop on
Marion search around there's my default

508
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,550
and on the back of it

509
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:57,550
catalyst get there but has an FCC ID and
if you grab Heidi and your mom site we

510
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:02,620
can search it come up with some
information and probably one of the most

511
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:07,660
useful things out of here is this right
here is telling us the exact frequency

512
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,020
with this going to transmit also once
you've got your back are upset all you

513
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,170
got to do radio installed you're trying
to sniff for the traffic you know

514
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,420
exactly what frequency list on

515
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:25,420
Thank You FCC and some other information
to I found on this before a manual that

516
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,170
actually gave the entire Palace purposes
fantastic so you never know what's going

517
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:33,190
. so I best my heart thank you guys for
bearing with me for the technical

518
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:41,050
difficulties on any any last questions
is but one that no well thanks for

519
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:57,460
standing on my head on it
