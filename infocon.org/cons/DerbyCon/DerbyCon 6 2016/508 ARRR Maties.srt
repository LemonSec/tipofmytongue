1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
absolute first derby Khan and I'm having
a great time and more importantly

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,599
sponsors actually let me come up the
organizers let me come up here and talk

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,040
in front of y'all for a few minutes
about what can be a very touchy subject

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,439
patriotism and speaking of touchy
subjects my lawyers are very touchy also

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,470
and want to make sure that I give the
standard disclaimer so everything about

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,140
to say or just my ideas and i have no
way shape or form any way reflect the

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,279
official policy of my employer my
employers employers so I'm going to talk

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,079
a little background today provide a use
case and then take any questions and

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,290
like everybody else today it seems in
this room this talk started as an

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,910
hour-long talk so I've knocked it down
to fit within the the 25 minutes so if

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,328
there seem to be any abrupt jumps and
the reasoning I'd love to talk with you

12
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,289
outside afterwards so I'm a scientist so
I start with a hypothesis and here's my

13
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,020
hypothesis today to spark conversation I
think on a very needed topic and that is

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,650
I completely believe that the United
States government cannot defend the

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,400
nation and its citizens in the digital
domain and I believe this is a

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,360
significant problem and so therefore we
should be exploring what capabilities

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,920
private citizens and corporations should
be allowed to employ for themselves

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,060
which means we have to evolve our
mindset over the next year or so to

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,740
figure out what capabilities private
industry should be allowed to protect

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,820
themselves more robustly until the
government can do their job

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,039
so today I'm not going to talk about
being pirates but being patriots and how

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,020
it's in our blood line to be able to
hack back so life used to be a lot less

23
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,509
complicated if someone wanted to hurt
you

24
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,530
they had to get pretty close to you and
then we developed the repeating rifle

25
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,939
and someone could be hiding on a
Ridgeline a hundred yards away and then

26
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,750
we figured out bombs and missiles and
drones and now they could be a continent

27
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,490
away and harm you and more importantly
today we have ones and zeros that can

28
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,048
damage your way of life and they could
be a world away when they attack you and

29
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,369
so normally as each way of disruptive
technology was imagined our laws

30
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,540
eventually catch up with the crime and
our defensive forces are eventually

31
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,470
resource

32
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,550
to be able to regulate encounter so in
the words of our greatest wartime

33
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,960
president abraham lincoln as our cases
in New so we have to think and act new

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,270
but I say hold hold a second we don't
really have to think of anything new we

35
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,490
can just resurrect older regulations and
concepts that are still on the books and

36
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,720
just go back to the future to make them
happen so if we hop in the wayback

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,350
machine right to 1787 when our founding
fathers were drafting the Constitution

38
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,959
so our founding fathers were really
revolutionary group they were diverse in

39
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,100
their professions and yet they were
unified in a common goal of American

40
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,170
liberty so they saw America's land of
freedom and opportunity with minimal

41
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,910
government intrusion and a very limited
federal government whose main goal in

42
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,680
life was to protect the people and
create a safe environment for them to

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,670
pursue happiness and so having just
defeated a centralized tyranny in the

44
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,989
revolutionary war they were very careful
about what powers they gave the federal

45
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:16,950
government to do those two things
protect the people and maintain a safe

46
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,238
environment for them so an article 1
section 8 of the Constitution this is

47
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,470
what made the final cut is being so
important and so the founding fathers

48
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,420
deliberated extensively to come up with
a document that can adapt and grow as x

49
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,768
went along to tackle issues technologies
and ways of life that they couldn't

50
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,300
possibly imagine

51
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,690
so what are these letters that the
Constitution refers to

52
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,799
well there a way that a nation can
redress the injuries of its citizens

53
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,019
without the need to go to full scale war
and over the years these terms have

54
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,620
become interchangeable and sometimes we
use them together but when Europe

55
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,810
started using them in the 13 hundreds
they had nuances and differences so

56
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,340
first you have letters of reprisal so
these were self-help remedies for

57
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,600
merchants that were injured by foreign
parties so basically they were issued in

58
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,640
a time of peace which is where we are
right now today right to allow the

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,108
bearer to seize property belonging to
individuals from a foreign nation in

60
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:20,579
recompense for their injuries on the
other hand these letters of marque your

61
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,300
mark depending on the correct
pronunciation of them we can argue that

62
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,710
for an hour to start with our issue
during a time of war authorizing

63
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,620
captain's to prey on enemy vessels and
international waters but regardless both

64
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,539
of them enabled private entities to be
an agent for the government to right a

65
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:43,289
wrong either dumb to them or to the
nation from a foreign actor or a

66
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:48,360
nation-state so if you think about it
back to the 17 seventies our nation was

67
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,130
faced with a monstrous fo Great Britain
it was the empire that the Sun never set

68
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,330
on they were a powerhouse not only in
the military sense both on land and on

69
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,919
see but also in the economic sense they
ruled the world and we were merely a

70
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,520
fledgling collection states that we were
trying to figure out how we were going

71
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,570
to prepare to fight on both land and sea
against a resource down to me that felt

72
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,380
they could just do whatever they wanted
to do and so George Washington

73
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,640
recognizing that we lack the time and
resources to develop a standing army

74
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,680
understanding Navy to fight for
independence turn to its citizens to our

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,160
Patriots and so these were men and women
that set aside their normal life

76
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,840
activities there nine to five job to
defend the nation and its people they

77
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,679
were faced with corruption and thieving
and malicious intent from an enemy that

78
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,700
did not respect the hard work that we
had put into constructing our way of

79
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,750
life until they took up arms to defend
the nation and it's the same thing we

80
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,400
face today I mean we're faced with
resourced enemies that don't respect our

81
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,440
laws don't respect our privacy or our
property and the government's just not

82
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,789
resource to defend us and so I can go
real a lot further in the history lesson

83
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,120
but due to time there's only one thing
you have to take away from it and that

84
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,710
is as a nation and even as a larger
international community we have long

85
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,400
provided that they're separate rules for
when we fight on land and when we fight

86
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,840
on see because we have different
objectives and so I'm contending that

87
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,060
conflict in the digital domain maps to
conflict on the open sea and therefore

88
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,720
we can use the same legal constructs so
let me explain

89
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:26,669
naval domain fighting in the eighteen
hundreds digital domain fighting today

90
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:31,320
so in both the attacker bears very
little personal risk right from a

91
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,580
privateer perspective the letters
allowed them to go after any vessel that

92
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,849
was flying a certain flag so they could

93
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:41,479
who's who they wanted to go against
right so they're gonna weigh the amount

94
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,039
of cool cargo on the vessel and how much
our moment that convoy has before they

95
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,300
make that decision to get the best rate
of return and for the bulk of the crew

96
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,719
they didn't have any personal resources
tied into whether the mission was

97
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:58,279
successful or not so it was minimal risk
for them and so from today's perspective

98
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:04,069
and offensive operator or Patriot is
going to be executing his hunts from for

99
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:07,999
her hunt from continents away and
therefore not closing in with the enemy

100
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:12,019
and going to be physically harmed well I
mean maybe eventually carpal tunnel

101
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:16,249
syndrome depending on how good and how
long they work and in both you can

102
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:22,189
impose significant economic harm without
civilian deaths so due to the built-in

103
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:25,369
constraints and legalities of the
privateering system which I'll talk

104
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:26,569
about in a minute

105
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:30,619
the system encourage the protection of
civilians because the target was just

106
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:36,559
disrupt the economy not other people
same thing today and additionally in

107
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:40,219
both it's hard to tell the difference
between a military on a civilian target

108
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:44,300
and infrastructure right because the
ship flooring a British flag then could

109
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,199
be a merchant with trade goods for the
Orient or they could be a resupply for

110
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,639
the English troops at Bunker Hill had to
board the vessel to figure out how it

111
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,930
was going to be able to be used and
that's why in conflict on the sea

112
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,819
targets were divided into permissible
things and impermissible things you

113
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:05,629
could not divide them into military
versus civilian targets and it's the

114
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:10,399
same thing for today's Patriots write a
cisco router or linux machine well it

115
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,939
could be a private companies or it could
be a military target and you don't know

116
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:18,679
until you actually touch it and in both
situations though you really don't want

117
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:23,958
to engage military targets right from a
privateer perspective your merchant ship

118
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,009
ok heavily armed merchant ship why in
the world would you go against a

119
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,499
line-of-battle British ship right

120
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:34,159
not only would they have just about no
cargo that was worth anything but they

121
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,519
were so heavily armed that they were
going to kick your body so there was no

122
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,649
purpose and it's the same with a today
it would be silly to go against military

123
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:48,500
targets in this construct and finally in
both the US forces just aren't currently

124
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,889
capable of defending the nation and bike

125
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:54,730
mention its citizens the moment there's
a great pool of trained folks both in

126
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,059
the civilian community in the military
community but the government still

127
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:01,988
trying to gather the resources required
to man trained and equipped a standing

128
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:06,160
force and you know unfortunately the
enemy's not going to wait for posits

129
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,719
actions and tool ready

130
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,350
we can't just tell the world stop
touching us until ready to defend the

131
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,730
nation and then you can start so we have
to figure out something as a stopgap

132
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,660
measure and so history tells us the
privateering and using these letters was

133
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,579
quite commonplace european union
european nations use this model for

134
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:29,349
centuries and more importantly for us
today it would grant us the time to

135
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,189
build our capabilities within the United
States government without completely

136
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:38,559
seeding the battlefield in the meantime
so the use of privateers also provides

137
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,579
the nation a strategic advantage as it's
a way to inflict harm on a foreign

138
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:48,459
entity without going to full-out war so
how we would do it i shall show you

139
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,689
so first we start with the players so
who are the players in this construct

140
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:57,160
well the first is the privateer right so
historically this was an armed vessel

141
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,660
owned outfitted and manned by private
parties not related to the federal

142
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,929
government with a commission to act from
the government

143
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,100
so today our crew of our ship would be a
crackerjack group of private individuals

144
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,149
with required technical skills to
conduct search and acquire missions

145
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,980
within the digital domain then we come
up to the promoter of the venture so

146
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,339
these were the owners of the vessels
that also finance the entire thing

147
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:26,110
so today this could be a company that
was attacked by a foreign entity they

148
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,129
would finance the entire reprisal
operation and I mean if there were a

149
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,879
large corporation maybe they have these
cracker jacks already on staff or if

150
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,539
there are smaller corporation they could
contract them out and this is the same

151
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:41,949
thing that used to happen in historic
times also then you come to who's

152
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:45,549
supposed to be issuing these letters
while the Constitution clearly states

153
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:50,439
that Congress has the sole right to
issue letters today and then you come up

154
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:54,399
with the Admiralty court so this was the
prize Court so this was the federal

155
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,069
court that once you went out and you did
your mission

156
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:00,128
you had to bring the bounty home to so
that way they could certify that

157
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:03,680
everything you did on the cruise was a
compliance with the letter

158
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,810
and today US federal statutes name the
federal district court as this entity so

159
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,550
this was a last debated back in the
early nineteen hundreds and so it's the

160
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,219
federal district court for us today

161
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,690
so now that I've identified the players
will lay out the game and so I'm going

162
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,620
to be talking about letters of reprisal
because unless congress declared war

163
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,290
this morning and I wasn't paying
attention because i was listening to

164
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,180
become talks i'm assuming we're still at
peace with the rest of the world so I'm

165
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,500
just talking about letters of reprisal
so first you have to prove that you've

166
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,270
been wrong to the federal district court
so you introduce some evidence and you

167
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,709
provide some sense of attribution on on
who performed the damage to you and your

168
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,520
corporation and you talk a little bit
about the scope or extent of the damage

169
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,000
that was that you received and so I
completely get it

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,620
attribution is really difficult and if
we start talking about apts it gets even

171
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,580
more difficult but the thing is is that
there's a lot of attacks that's just

172
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,260
totally not the case

173
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,089
I mean picture yourself as Land Rover
two years ago they were able to

174
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:13,130
attribute beyond the shadow of illegal
doubt that a Chinese auto manufacturing

175
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,060
company stole their intellectual
property which caused them significant

176
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,229
economic harm so this construct have
been in place back then they could have

177
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,860
approached the modern-day version of
this admiralty court to request a letter

178
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,660
of reprisal so kind of update and put
your head picture an episode of Judge

179
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,140
Judy right and that's kind of what the
plaintiff provides is what you have to

180
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,830
provide to the federal district court
but unlike you know judge judy where she

181
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,370
hears two amazing cases and merely a
30-minute window and makes the final

182
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,510
decision on who's guilty and who's not
in this case the federal district court

183
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,069
hears all the facts of the case and then
would pass a recommendation to Congress

184
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,310
or sub committee of Congress saying
whether or not the facts of the case

185
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:57,050
supported the issuance of a letter and
that's because well you're getting a

186
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,510
letter because it was a foreign actor
that did this to you

187
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,470
and so the idea is that Congress should
be able to take a strategic view and

188
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,520
decide if there's other foreign policy
concerns or constraints about not

189
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,180
wanting to issue a letter at least
that's what they're supposed to be doing

190
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,680
right keeping track of the strategic
environment so if you can prove that you

191
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,290
were wrong

192
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,680
and who wronged you and so let's say
that Congress gives you a letter

193
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,719
reprisal so the real economic damage to
land rover can you guess which is the

194
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,769
real land rover and which is the
knockoff version it wasn't the loss of

195
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:32,160
sales right because true believers will
understand this is merely a knockoff

196
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,269
about the big damage came from the
dilution of its trademark and design and

197
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:40,649
all the R&D they put into this car so
you get the letter and it goes to the

198
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,300
captain of the team so this is the CEO
of the wrong company and so the letter

199
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,508
comes with certain requirements and
bounds this is not just a free-for-all

200
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:49,949
to do what you will

201
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:55,589
against this other auto manufacturer
others constraints that are built in and

202
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:58,800
so letters started with a bunch of
standard constraints and then some

203
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,729
specific ones but the first two big
things for what you were not allowed to

204
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,730
do and this has been an every letter
that the United States government has

205
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,680
ever issued in its lifetime and the
first is you can't suppress or distort

206
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,910
evidence that you found when you board
the vessel that makes sense right

207
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,360
something to definitely keep for our
modern-day reinterpretation basically

208
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,680
you just can't falsify the information
or the action logs of how your operation

209
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,099
took place or what you found and
needless to say you have to keep very

210
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,819
good records as you go along so you can
later prove exactly what you did and

211
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,949
what you targeted in your operation

212
00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:35,279
the second thing you weren't allowed to
do is you weren't allowed to embezzle

213
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,260
cargo also very solid basically you are
required to present to the court at the

214
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,949
end of the operation with a true
accounting of all property in this case

215
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,519
both intellectual and monetary that you
recovered or seized during your

216
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,449
operation

217
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:51,569
I mean you're already being allowed to
do really cool stuff so why would you

218
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:56,519
lie about what you actually found next
you had to bring once the operation was

219
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,899
done everything all the prizes to the
proper court for adjudication which

220
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,290
basically means you go back to the
federal district court to validate your

221
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,670
actions and the scope of the prize and
which did and of course you are always

222
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,760
required to protect neutral rights
during the operation

223
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,209
you couldn't go attacking neutral
parties which in the equivalent of

224
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:18,300
military operations is we don't go out
and start attacking the Red Cross

225
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,399
there was also limitations placed on the
captain of what was a permissible target

226
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,050
at the start of the operation

227
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,949
so basically this will tell you the
scope of who you could recoup your

228
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:35,529
losses from and then it also talked
about the prize sums so how it would be

229
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:39,699
divided between the owners in the crew
and this was to ensure that all promises

230
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,750
a prize money were duly recorded before
the adventure began so that way no one

231
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,560
got cheated out of their fair share and
I think it's a good thing to keep in our

232
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,250
modern-day letters to protect our
crackerjack team and they also said what

233
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,029
you were allowed to take and then
finally all letters had an expiration

234
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:58,899
date it wasn't an open-ended thing you
would have so many days in order to

235
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,610
execute your operation so this is all
sorts of information that would be in

236
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,449
your letter

237
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:07,060
who's allowed to do it what you're
allowed to do and how much you can take

238
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:11,768
for instance if you received a letter
reprisal out that a specific threat

239
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:16,389
entity caused you 10 million dollars in
damage would be constrained to something

240
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:20,680
along the same order of magnitude to
steal back in to recoup your losses and

241
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,819
you would not be allowed to go try to
take a hundred million dollars from that

242
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:29,529
that company these letters which
authorized actions at your own expense

243
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,829
in essence made you an agent of the
government when you were doing the

244
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:36,609
actions in accordance with the scope of
the letter and so therefore you would be

245
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,540
protected from being arrested or
extradited to a foreign nation for the

246
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,410
results of these operations as long as
you stayed and bounded letter you're

247
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,120
protected so in order to receive this
letter right so Congress decides the

248
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,329
federal court says ok we agree you got
$MONEY

249
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:59,109
hey you definitely need a letter you got
your stuff stolen and they decide here's

250
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,189
the bounds of your letter before you can
start the operation you had to put up a

251
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,780
bond and so that bond would cover the
estimated cost of damages that you might

252
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,220
ensue if the operation goes outside the
scope of the letter so you post a bond

253
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,380
not a james bond but a bond to make sure
that you don't turn pirate and you know

254
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,230
there's some math out there that could
help develop with a good bond for

255
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,760
specific hacking operation would be but
once you have the bond in place then the

256
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,169
operation can begin

257
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:30,790
so going back to the land rover example
just purely fictional Land Rovers is a

258
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,950
really large company with an excellent
IT staff

259
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,180
laughs but they weren't really trained
in offensive operations so they

260
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,490
subcontracted out to a team of Cracker
Jacks from a private company and so when

261
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,320
the CEO was granted a letter against JMC
it listed Land Rovers the wronged party

262
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,179
and enlisted who they had subcontracted
with and this was to make sure of the

263
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,690
credentials of the individuals that are
doing the work because it's not just any

264
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,810
Tom Dick or Harry you don't want them
just mucking around you wanted

265
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:03,250
professionals to do it so historically
once the operation is done so you go do

266
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,570
the operation you bring your booty back
to the federal district court and that's

267
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,230
when the adjudication starts and so back
in the day it started with a public

268
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,760
announcement so that way everybody that
wanted to attend could and basically

269
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,080
what the US always did in our use of
letters of reprisal was we did a trial

270
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,189
by jury and the whole purpose of that
trial when it came back was to make sure

271
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,540
that the captured vessel and goods were
within scope of the letter and that the

272
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,560
crew absolutely conducted operations
within the bounds of the letter that's

273
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,700
all they were validating so back to the
land rover example right so they've

274
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,240
completed their operation and now they
have to explain what they did so that

275
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,710
their that team of Cracker Jacks was
able to infiltrate the CEO of GMCs

276
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,390
computer do to your password management
because that's the easiest way so it

277
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,630
turns out the CEO had bought a new
toaster which connects to your home

278
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,320
Wi-Fi to pull the weather report for the
day and then series that into your

279
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,950
morning toast this is indeed a true
product on the market today

280
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:05,050
well turns out there's flaws in the code
well it's fictional right i don't know

281
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,800
if there's actually flaws in the code
but no let's just pretend they're art

282
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,330
and it allowed the Land Rover team into
his home Wi-Fi because of course he uses

283
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,290
the same credentials at home as he does
for his business computer and so on and

284
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,830
so on and so on and we can all see
what's going to happen at this point and

285
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,580
the net result is they were able to
transfer 300 million dollars to an

286
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,409
offshore bank account and they cause no
permanent physical damage to any device

287
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:34,630
or any person throughout the operation
so the CEO of land rover and his chief

288
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,630
of his cracker jacks come to back to the
federal district court they lay out

289
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,480
everything they did how they did it

290
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,870
the amount of money that captured and of
course luckily for them the court agrees

291
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,189
everything was done with a bow

292
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,150
little the letter and now they were able
to transfer that 300 million dollars to

293
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,130
their own account so in essence the
prize Court controlled the income of the

294
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,380
pot privateers they only made money if
you snagged prizes off the high seas

295
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,280
within the bounds of the Charter and
bring it safely back to court so once

296
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,610
land rover pays whatever court costs and
lawyer fees are associated with the

297
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,240
action they divide up the remainder of
the money in accordance with the letter

298
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,710
between the team of Cracker Jacks in the
company so what happens if the Court

299
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,730
finds that the operation was totally
legit and it was outside the bounds of

300
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,360
the letters written well first there was
the bond right the big bond that they

301
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,649
put up so if someone comes forward and
says that they were grievously harmed

302
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,000
because the mission

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,060
well then they could petition the
federal district court and they could

304
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,520
receive a portion of that bond but if
the operation is considered a outside

305
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,490
the scope of the issued letter other
than the government could effectively

306
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,110
rescind the protections of the letter
and therefore that foreign entity can

307
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,620
pursue criminal charges on the captain
and crew in accordance with their laws

308
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,760
and well if we had an extradition treaty
with them well I hope you enjoy your new

309
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,900
jail cell

310
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,940
so three big questions very briefly the
first big question is did it really work

311
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,560
when private citizens and patriots focus
on disrupting the economies of foreign

312
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,550
entities that had done harm to u.s.
citizens didn't really stop them from

313
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,720
doing it again

314
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,250
well most historians say yes but there's
no real limited ability to actually

315
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,810
prove it because most of the records are
gone the next question is does Congress

316
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,889
still have the power to issue these and
well even though Congress has an

317
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,670
exercise his power and almost 200 years
the courts will likely find that

318
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,480
Congress still indeed has it because the
clause is still in our Constitution and

319
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,960
more importantly we've never signed or
ratified any international agreements to

320
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,060
include the decoration of Paris of 1865
to give up that right so offline we can

321
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,240
talk lots about international law if
you'd like to

322
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,350
and is there really need to be able to
use them well I say they're kinda is

323
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,399
right we sure not going to declare war
with North Korea because Sony lost some

324
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,270
property

325
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,750
I mean so many other their actions in
the last decades have not propelled us

326
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,720
to declare war with them

327
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,169
you know we should have an ability for a
lesser response i mean other than

328
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:01,770
parking a nuclear submarine off the
coast or landing army troops on the

329
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,700
ground we should have something to
respond to them when foreign actors

330
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,059
attack our citizens and our way of life
because you know if your house was

331
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,330
broken into today you could call the
police and they would do something about

332
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,770
it if your servers broken into tomorrow
and your intellectual property is stolen

333
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:21,270
our governments as tough luck you should
have had better protection on because

334
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,850
the government's not resource to be able
to defend you

335
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,360
so we can either wait till they are
resourced or we can do something now to

336
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,289
hold the tide the hacking of
corporations in cyberspace will not stop

337
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:35,010
until hostile states and foreign actors
are forced to reconsider the cost of

338
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,820
their actions are government should be
defending its citizens and our right to

339
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,928
happiness in a more perfect union and
using Patriots as a time-honored way to

340
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,590
do that so back to my hypothesis to
start at all the United States

341
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,860
government can't provide protection or
defendant citizens in the digital domain

342
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,570
today and therefore we should be having
a meaningful conversation as a nation to

343
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,928
talk about what capabilities we should
allow private citizens or private

344
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:00,150
corporations to have and many people
think
