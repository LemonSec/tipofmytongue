1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
i guess i can start whenever no one
really gave me a heads-up or anything so

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,540
i'm chris lopez bein my talks really
about my childhood hacking adventures

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,399
and how I grew up packing diablo 2 i'm
going to talk a lot about diablo 2 um

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,190
there's way more involved with this but
first I'm gonna tell you a little bit

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,630
about myself and my professional
experience and that sort of thing so

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,830
really who I am I like right now this
quote really sums up my life and I'm

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,119
actually going to read it to you

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,570
I'm learning to understand rather than
immediately judge or to be judged i

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,530
cannot find sorry I'm not used to
speaking with a mic like this i cannot

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,630
blindly follow the crowd and accept
their approach

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,020
I will not allow myself to indulge in
the usual manipulating game roll clip

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,160
roll creation

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,269
fortunately for me my self knowledge has
transcended that that and I have become

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,460
to understand that life is best to be
lived not to be conceptualized I'm happy

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,789
because I'm growing daily and honestly
not knowing where the limit lies to be

16
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,180
certain everyday there can be a new
revelation or new discovery at church

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,469
their memory of the past misfortunes has
added more to my bank of 42 that's kind

18
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,850
of like my monitor on life right now and
so really I'm a Red Team guy like I've

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,429
always been breaking things that's
always what I've been interested in i

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,210
just kind of fell into it when I was
younger so and I get really excited when

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,990
i bypassed things like recently bypass
silence and I think my exact words were

22
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,570
f yeah dad censoring the language there
since I know we have younger people in

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,229
the room and Joe yeah I'm really a gamer
first like the reason I got into hacking

24
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,100
was from playing video games and I'm
getting like a lot of the games that I

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,689
played throughout the years and kind of
the different concepts i was introduced

26
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,720
to and what's leading up to what I'm
doing now

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,630
so like clouds building their hardcore
gamer because they're sent home playing

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,798
xbox a lot i used to be a professional
gamer and I played like 18 hours a day

29
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,829
so it takes a lot of work like 10 people
don't really view playing video games as

30
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,548
work but you're actually doing it
professionally like you have to play

31
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,170
every day it's in your contract a lot of
people don't get that dealer so I'm a

32
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,770
hacker second really that was from you
know playing video games and start

33
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,798
learning about different acts within
video games and then start actually

34
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,640
hacking the video games and just start
started to hack people that were playing

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,260
the games and seeing all the items and
stuff

36
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,078
so you know I can pretty much a Gibson
my professional experience couple

37
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:23,010
different companies and I worked for
discover trust my spot allows an interim

38
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,530
they're doing on their vulnerability
assessment in developing their

39
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,200
vulnerability scanner and MasterCard did
some consulting there i'm currently at a

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,040
grocery store chain called snoops in the
st. Louis area but I'm not here

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,390
representing them today so i kinda going
to go into like a little bit of my

42
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,720
gaming escapades and like really
everything started out with Dawson like

43
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,810
I'm sure plenty of people in the room
remember this and actually installing

44
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,890
daus games

45
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:54,119
does anyone know what this game is ok
one person that seen my talk before just

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,190
admires pirates you know you've probably
heard of it before civilization that's

47
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,959
pretty big game series but I started out
really like playing pirates and stuff

48
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,840
it's just really cool game there wasn't
any like hacking stuff that we did with

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,349
it but you know I was like my first
introduction to computers was installing

50
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,488
games and boss like already familiar
with command line and doing that sort of

51
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,150
thing that's why I was preached that's
so important so you know then we got

52
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,079
into like were Crafton i started
learning about things like map pack and

53
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,810
that sort of thing that they actually
are hacks for games and that you can

54
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,049
kind of cheat at him and you know
learning about cheat codes and stuff

55
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,069
like that another game we played was
team fortress classic this is when we

56
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,679
really learn like you could actually
like script things within games and like

57
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,940
instantly build uh you know it hurt or
something like that and upgrade it

58
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,829
really quickly so far craft same sort of
thing like map pack if you look at this

59
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,900
map the mini-map in the bottom left hand
corner you'll see that everything is

60
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,230
actually revealed and that's because of
like this is a screenshot whenever using

61
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,399
that back and so you know one of the
first things I kind of learned about in

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,659
terms of like Jackson games and how you
can gain a competitive advantage from

63
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,698
that and Socko deeper into that more
about starcraft and then no diablo was

64
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:09,359
really like the big game but first game
that like really started like getting

65
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:13,199
more into the acts of like you know
everything was third sub client-side so

66
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,440
you could like get any item you want and
everything with your character for

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,918
anyone played the original Diablo you
guys know what I'm talking about

68
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:26,080
but now really the habla to is my was my
bread and butter of what

69
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,120
I got into hacking or how I got into
hacking rather and so like when we first

70
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,139
started off playing diablo 2 huh you
know mostly it's like I wanted to be

71
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:40,300
rich in this game and play in these
rooms called Paula PK which was like if

72
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,909
you're a paladin and I was like a pvp
channel and room so you could join up in

73
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:49,270
the game and the return events and stuff
like that if you played all the time and

74
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,289
you really needed have like the best
gear to compete in there so the whole

75
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,159
thing was like we're trying to get rich
to compete in like these little peepee

76
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:00,580
tournaments or rooms and so we did a lot
of screaming and stuff like that like

77
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,349
there's certain places in diablo where
you can like drop an item behind like a

78
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:09,280
stand like this and then i can actually
pick up from the other side so he would

79
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,859
do a lot of that and like even classic
spamming on battlenet like a blizzard

80
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,740
employees I'm your CD key and stuff like
that or like in your account information

81
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,849
then we started to meet more people
through aim all things and so we got

82
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:28,990
connected with these a little attackers
community and this guy started teach us

83
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,069
how to find item duplication methods
like all right it's gonna be awesome

84
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:37,930
like will do all these items you know
get all the 2020s OJ's and you know

85
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,779
we'll be rich I'll be able to get all
the items that we want and then compete

86
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:46,690
in this BP stuff so we learn about like
mousepads map pack and the thing we

87
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,620
ended up doing with mousepads map pack
was like super funny but I'm not gonna

88
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,120
get into that yet i'm going to focus
more on some of the item duplication

89
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,800
methods that we had with my brother and
I personally found my other ones that

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,520
actually wrote uh you know the little
program for it in the end that was

91
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,349
written bb or whatever it was back then
but you know we were apart and active

92
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:11,529
part of those hackers community and
we're actually an admin and you know

93
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:15,159
we've been there since 2002 where some
of the people that ran it you know the

94
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:20,050
name is redacted here but that actually
is our account so really like we're the

95
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,539
ones that did fine like the infamous
charsi and Boop and so like what you

96
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:28,960
would do essentially is just walk up to
char c get some information

97
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,190
drop your item get some information from
that and then interact with charts again

98
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,680
and plug all that information back end

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,680
and so really like whenever you look at
this like we were really just kids

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,580
playing with numbers like you know it's
simple as like finding charsi so you

101
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,210
need to find the idea of Charles II more
lols exes are that would be charges ID

102
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,989
every time and so there's a program
called you to hack at a bunch of hackers

103
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,250
already wrote to reverse-engineer the
diablo 2 protocol and so you can just

104
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,250
drop an item and then you can see all
the packets since they had figured

105
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,060
everything out and all the data
structures down and I so it's really

106
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,539
cool you know you just like Ramsey to
hack you click on chart see that you

107
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:08,469
found the idea of chart see you drop
your item you pick it back up you get

108
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,190
the item of the ID and then you go to
char C and you send the same in boot

109
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,360
packets and just replace the X's and
disease and it was simple as that

110
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,780
you know you would have the item would
be in the boo and then another one would

111
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,039
drop on the ground so you just did that
over and over again and that's how we

112
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,509
got rich we can finally can be allocated
lpk like awesome you know I can finally

113
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:31,960
have one of the best characters in there
and and you know be one of the best few

114
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,690
beers in diablo 2 and that was it went
well for a while but you know there's

115
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,030
there's certain aspects these things
that you don't think about and was it

116
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,440
can actually track all this so like
whenever you play diablo 2 hardcore like

117
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,219
a common thing was like you get the
windows be a key back in the day and you

118
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,610
get stuck and then you die and then like
whenever you lose on hardcore mode your

119
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,949
character is dead you lose everything
game over

120
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:01,210
and so like what blizzard did to us up
like patching the chart she do they

121
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,469
removed all the duplicate items from
battle net and so then you know it was

122
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,520
like we hit the Windows key and playing
hardcore and you know we're back to back

123
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,349
to squared 0 and so like this one are we
starting a different approach and we met

124
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:17,860
with the guys from the mall before and
afters them we can go on google and

125
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,650
shout about security but we started
looking at you know Trojans like net

126
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,690
double and we're also admins on blues
hackers so we got this idea there's map

127
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,979
pack there's all these other hacks that
everyone uses the play diablo 2 weather

128
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,800
like you're trying to do more nefarious
stuff like me or just play the game

129
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,370
doesn't like just no one played that
game without map pack siren was getting

130
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,240
that back and arrow was getting a
getting the link to map pack from blizz

131
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,860
hackers well guess what I was the person
providing that link and if you ever went

132
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,150
to was hackers and down

133
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,329
the map pack from the links that we
posted up there these are like this

134
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,870
whenever we got introduced to critters
and binders and so we had an

135
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,920
undetectable version of net double-ought
that was buying it with every hack that

136
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,099
came out and so every new hack that came
out we're the ones being notified since

137
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,420
we were part of that community we post
up and say hey like get your hacks from

138
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,479
here and we would have mousepads website
on there there be a couple geo city

139
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,710
sights in there you probably avoid those
so like they were download map pack from

140
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,440
our site and we will get a message on if
anyone remembers icq we get their IP and

141
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,530
this is whenever network address
translation didn't exist yet so like

142
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,130
everyone's just plug straight into their
cable modem has 56 k whatever it may

143
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,840
have been back in those days and so
super funny we would probably change and

144
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,460
connect up and really using like Proctor
Chainz as a metaphor here not the actual

145
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,610
tool proxy chains itself is not only
used but but anyway like to practice

146
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,720
exchange connect up you know they'd be
playing diablo we shut down the elbow to

147
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,750
get their password we change it to
something else would steal all their

148
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,160
items transfer over to our account and
then we lock them out the accounts and

149
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,850
we just did that over and over again all
day i have stories of like when friends

150
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,860
came over and like like an eighth grader
a freshman in high school and like maybe

151
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,250
it was like the first time after us like
partying and the next morning i'm

152
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,760
sitting there just like hacking gobble
two accounts my buddy's like wait are

153
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,080
you hacking people right now like yeah
like it's super easy like I just going

154
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,680
to download this and then I just take
all their stop basically because I'm

155
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,920
keylogging everything that they do
they're logging into your account

156
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,719
like that's how we primarily got rich
and like really profited in diablo 2

157
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,960
that was very successful and you know we
never really told me the police hackers

158
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,490
people about this because we weren't
being very nice lady called social

159
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,020
engineering but really I was just being
a huge dick have you want to be asked

160
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,160
with it like everyone says like social
engineering is like almost time you're

161
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,760
just abusing people's trust and I can
call it social engineering you want to

162
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,650
but really just kind of being mean
certainly like what most people think is

163
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,120
like you know in this scenario like I
would have just like profit or not but

164
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,780
what successful know is like get to fail
a bunch of times and you only learn from

165
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,470
failure

166
00:10:59,470 --> 00:10:59,800
I

167
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,370
you know you don't really learn too much
success so we failed a bunch like we

168
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,459
lost all of our items over and over
again but we didn't give up and we got

169
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,890
more creative and more nefarious so it's
kind of like transition away from like

170
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,040
the Diablo hacking days i was really
involved with this game called delta

171
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,599
which defense of the ancients and so
like I did actually used to play for

172
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,010
evil genius in this game I played the
original map for like I'm one of the

173
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,149
people has been around the DOTA
community longer than anyone like i used

174
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:33,250
to talk to I strong and you'll daily
which of the people that I strikes the

175
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,610
guy that made dota2 with valve and
everything it's just a huge game noun

176
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,200
have actually opted to go to the
International which is like a 20 million

177
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,149
dollar tournament for dota instead of
DEFCON the past two years but this is

178
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:49,899
the original map and i was one of the
best players ever at this specific map

179
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:55,240
but then it came out with a new one and
so some of the stuff like methods that I

180
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,700
came up with i'm not actually going to
play these videos due to time

181
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,930
constraints but some of the methods that
we came up with my team back then like

182
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,810
create blocking and pulling and stuff
like that were the ones that kind of

183
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,709
invented all that and now I you know
people at these 20 million dollar

184
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:13,060
tournaments actually still employ these
methods today so it's really cool to see

185
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,729
that like we're the ones I kind of came
up with these unique ideas and now

186
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,930
people are still using them to win like
20 million dollars so it's kind of

187
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:25,359
insane but you never heard of it before
before i go check it out yet so great

188
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,200
blocking is like in DotA you have a
non-player characters that are going up

189
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
the lanes and the whole objective of
photos that killed the other teams

190
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,529
ancient and so these non-player
characters are kind of like battling the

191
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:39,370
whole time those towers in each lane so
what you would do is you would stand in

192
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,270
front of the creeps and block them so
they wouldn't be smooth slower and then

193
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,050
I you know there were hills and stuff
and you if you are up on a hill and your

194
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,219
point was down the hill there was a
mischance whenever they try and hit you

195
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,209
up hill so by blocking the creeps you
actually get a significant advantage and

196
00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:00,670
other things like pulling we point to
other uh usual camps so that all those

197
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,670
unions actually deny experience your
opponent they don't get any experience

198
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,300
or cold so it's like a different way of
looking at the game vs like everyone

199
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,779
like focus on killing each other for a
long time than we realize like others

200
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:12,910
all this efficiency and stuff we can do
on the map

201
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,709
kind of people around I'm so again it's
the same thing like I failed over and

202
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:23,410
over again before I successful even with
like the gaming stuff so my open-source

203
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,410
escapades like the main thing that I've
known for is the hydro project and

204
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,969
specifically anhydride project was the
person that made the new linux work on

205
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,990
the device so like touch screen all that
like their here's a screenshot our

206
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,430
picture i took of my iphone 3g running
ubuntu this is like the first time we

207
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,780
ever actually read a bunch you want to
the iphone which was super cool and so

208
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,959
it ended up turning into a pretty cool
thing I contribute to open open open

209
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,320
embedded and they asked me to come speak
and wondering with them at the first

210
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,820
jailbreak on but i was a college student
I can't afford to go so but this was the

211
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,980
end results actually did look very
mobile

212
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,850
unfortunately this specific phone still
on my car like a year and a half ago so

213
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,390
I don't have it anymore I could probably
do it all but it was a lot of work and

214
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,439
so it was like don't probably the only
iphone the world i was booting like four

215
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,350
or five different operating systems and
everything was working on it that sort

216
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,490
of thing but there's a lot of work so
again you know it was like fail fail

217
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,900
fail fail and succeed like I can't tell
you how much time we spent getting the

218
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,170
touchscreen to work and stuff like that
we just kept having to try new ideas

219
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,160
different drivers and I eventually just
got a little to work with GV def which

220
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:34,030
is very generic Linux driver almost kind
of known for CTF arm so my first

221
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,770
conference security conference was def
con 16 I went out there I was 21 years

222
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:44,230
old and I i met a guy there from the
team sap it's he invited me to complete

223
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,530
the CTF team because i was working on
the hydro project is one of those things

224
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,770
where I was like with like everything
that I've done up to this point I've

225
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,420
just been following passion like diablo
2 I was just trying to be like the best

226
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,770
at that game dota the same thing and
then like with divers project i just

227
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,590
thought that was really cool and so I
started out just writing documentation

228
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,530
for that if you go out and you go to
hydrate project wiki you'll see on the

229
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,319
person that originally created the
installation guide developer guide so on

230
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,190
and so forth

231
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,550
it's really like an extreme power user
and then some guy was trying to get a

232
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,969
bunch of the pork up to work on it and
boot now it's like taking need some help

233
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:21,280
and that's kind of how all that started
the is so the first SETI really played

234
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,319
in was def con 17 qualifiers and we got
like 16 3 cool away from

235
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,980
actually making it that happened over
like the next few years and then I just

236
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,180
kind of got discouraged because being
that close i'm not actually making it

237
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,829
can be kind of heartbreaking

238
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,330
this is me at DEFCON 16 or 17 and
someone put backtrack on a kiosk at the

239
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,640
Riviera had no idea who would do that
arm and I like actually went to illinois

240
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,210
state university university for a while
I went to a tech school straight out of

241
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,240
high school and then transferred to ISU
and so I was doing all the hydride

242
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,140
project stuff they're starting getting
involved a lot more collegiate

243
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,850
competition so like CCDC if you guys are
familiar with that which is more about

244
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,370
your defending against professional red
teamers all day and i personally don't

245
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,910
like that competition nearly as much
it's sometimes fun but there's another

246
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,560
competition i competed in the National
Cyber League actually did end up winning

247
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,979
this and being out students from MIT and
stuff like that so i can say i'm a

248
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:25,480
national cyber champion but I don't know
how cool that is so you know he's like

249
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,170
one of my favorite pictures ever have
myself wearing a hat all day like she

250
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,770
was winter and like they came in like to
do pictures like that you have to take

251
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,550
the head off on like okay so i'm
actually really like this picture just

252
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,640
because it's like I don't know why they
didn't make us put our arms around each

253
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,210
other or something but we just looked
really lanky and kind of derby here not

254
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,180
now thank you

255
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,430
that's a Ben 10 shirt you have to be
special to get one of those now I'm so

256
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,959
like we also i also just collected
everything from CTF time with the team

257
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,870
that I hooked up with was just trying to
play in all the cts that I could and

258
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,740
like it was quite a while for actually
had success in it you know like I would

259
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,430
only solve like a challenge or two in
each CTF but I would learn something and

260
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,310
then I would always look at like all the
people on my team there write-ups all

261
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:14,260
the rights that come out and I learn
more tips and tricks that way so we want

262
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,189
a couple different CCS cts like besides
Chicago besides Detroit from the whole

263
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:21,939
besides joint task force again another
shout-out to bend for doing that stuff

264
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:26,860
but I created a security club that only
state university university coll is X of

265
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,540
the guys are in the room shout out to
them and that was a really positive

266
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,450
thing but there's a lot of is a sec

267
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,140
Adam I actually gave a talk on that
circle city con I I know some of you

268
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,730
were at that time at that talk

269
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,720
go check it out on youtube I can't have
too much time to like really delve into

270
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,390
things so this is actually a screenshot
from the talk on youtube but again there

271
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,900
was one of those things like even with
ISU second all the CTF stuff like this

272
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,290
the same theme right like I failed and
failed and failed and failed and then I

273
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:01,120
finally succeeded like failure is only
like you only have failure when you give

274
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,010
up on something when you give up that's
when you failed i am sure some things

275
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,140
might not actually be like possible to
physics or something but you know like

276
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,980
the main thing is like don't don't give
up on yourself don't give up on the

277
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,010
stuff that you believe in don't give up
on your passions and like to keep moving

278
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,400
forward because i can't tell you how
many times that I just wanted to stop

279
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,410
doing it all to be honest like yes
Israel so like really getting into like

280
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,980
Python like my methodology of how I
approach things now like I played this

281
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,690
game called Megaman right like I i guess
if you're younger you might not be

282
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:40,030
familiar with it but mega man-like it
was just a platformer game for nintendo

283
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:44,740
regular nintendo and is a game that I
really really liked but a couple years

284
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,600
we gonna notice this pattern right like
megaman and kind of application security

285
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,889
and even just like hacking in general
but you know like Kevin Megaman your

286
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,870
application with me and you have this
controller input right well with web

287
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,770
application has a keyboard as your input
and like yeah there may be a lot more

288
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:08,260
buttons and stuff on the web application
side but it's still kind of the same

289
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,070
concept right and so like the main thing
that I ask myself is like all right

290
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,168
what's the inputs like what can I do
with that input like how does it like

291
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:20,890
how does the boss actually work what I'm
fighting like actually we're like does

292
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,900
it just a dodge me for a while like what
weapons is vulnerable to that sort of

293
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,380
thing so it's the same really like the
same thing with applications if you

294
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,470
think about it like you have this input
and you're just trying to figure out

295
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,070
what you can do with input to make
something break her to feed something so

296
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,990
i would really like to show this boss
fight but unfortunately i probably don't

297
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,860
have time

298
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:47,290
so what the main part like with this
like boss fight is like in megaman

299
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,620
whenever you first like approach the
boss you can see like he has a bunch of

300
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,860
different weapons that he's searching
through there

301
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,159
like when we first approached boss like
you would get different weapons from

302
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,190
defeating other bosses and so like
certain bosses were vulnerable to

303
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,059
certain weapons so if you cycle through
all your weapons and fire each one to

304
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:08,520
see like what did the most damage to it
that's the process of fuzzing really and

305
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,410
so like I was one of those things where
I never thought that you know I learned

306
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:17,429
too much for video games but really like
games like this

307
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:21,570
Tommy actually how to plus things and
that's something that's very important

308
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,010
industry if you want to do more security
research specifically even if you just

309
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,320
want to be like a really skilled
pentester it's something that's

310
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,280
important so anyway like you can see in
that video like he found the weapon that

311
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,309
was vulnerable to he started firing it
and the boss was taking a lot more

312
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:40,080
damage there was a pattern to it so like
this kind of transitions to what I'm

313
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,699
doing now and so I'm actually trying to
develop a video game and i would say i'm

314
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,250
trying i actually am doing this so the
first person that's it's called

315
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,580
conscious hacker and the whole premise
of the game really is the gardener

316
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,899
interested in infosec and so how many
people have here have played like some

317
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,460
war games before like over the wires
smash the stack stuff like that if you

318
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,080
haven't I highly encourage you to go out
and check some of those out how many

319
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,620
people in your plate like a steam game
before know like the same console and

320
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,668
like it drops down

321
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:16,260
ok cool a lot more hands they're so like
if you can imagine a platformer where

322
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,870
you're the premise of the game is to
hack or secure a computer-controlled

323
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:27,840
door and so it's going to work very much
seen console-style and it's i'm actually

324
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,389
linking up real systems into the game
much like war games so like it's I'm not

325
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,570
like I'm not faking it i'm not trying to
emulate it i'm giving them the real

326
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,470
thing and I'm gonna hold their hand
along the way to a certain degree i

327
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,150
would get into like the different like
styles of teaching within infosec itself

328
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,020
but i don't have five minutes left if
you're more interested in that I have

329
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,379
some great analogies with ballet
specifically and how they teach ballet

330
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,130
and how that's actually like the
offensive security try harder attitude

331
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,220
as well not sure if they even know that
that's the style teaching they're using

332
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,540
but that's what they're doing

333
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,540
so anyway come talk to me later and i'll
tell you more about that

334
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:08,850
anyway like I said you have a full game
design document and I'm very close to

335
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,359
being to the point where I could
actually Kickstarter GoFundMe that sort

336
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:18,570
of thing so i have a gentleman who used
to work on world warcraft and leave

337
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,309
legend that's been guiding me through
this is aliases l mass if you google him

338
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:26,820
you'll see that he was a big part of
warcraft world of warcraft and did a lot

339
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,928
for the legends as well so he's kind of
guiding you through the process of

340
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:34,830
actually creating a successful game
whereas i'm doing all the security part

341
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:39,210
of it and he's connecting me with people
to hire for game design and stuff like

342
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,649
that because i can't specifically for
him so I think it's gonna be really cool

343
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:46,918
thing like so like one of the main
mistakes I made in the beginning was I

344
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,970
was just just went straight in and
started developing right like alright

345
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,989
cool you know i got these rooms and
stuff like red and blue doors and like

346
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:59,129
it's gonna be really sweets and then
like you can run around in the rooms

347
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:03,539
whatnot but I'm like well how's the game
actually going to work like what you do

348
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:07,980
in it so you know I kind of like hit
that wall that's when I really started

349
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,859
to reach out and get a real game
designer involved to help guide me

350
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:14,519
through building a successful video game
and some of the puzzle ideas that i have

351
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,419
to actually implement the ideas like you
hack or secure this computer controlled

352
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,499
or and then whatever you learn in that
lesson we're going to reflect it in the

353
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:26,369
platformer level in the boss as well so
that we're trying to reinforce things

354
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:30,330
that way and you know there's gonna be
friendly in nbc's if any of you guys did

355
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,049
the sands holiday hacking challenge last
year like that was super cool if you

356
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:36,960
haven't looked at that i highly
encourage you to go check it out because

357
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,070
they had friendly npcs based on like
real people from sands that were

358
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,090
instructors and they gave enough
information to actually work through

359
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,350
these CTF challenges and like that would
actually was a challenge to like someone

360
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,219
did win that but they gave information
where you can get all the way through it

361
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,129
and I actually did manage to get all the
way through with all the information

362
00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:59,908
that they provided so seeing that
reminded me that like mentorship can

363
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:03,899
also happen through like non play
non-player characters and not many

364
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:07,768
people actually have a contact sands to
see what was going on there like oh well

365
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:11,609
you're overthinking it like look at this
hint here in the game which I thought

366
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:14,369
was really cool again it's the same
thing same to you

367
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,110
themes in my talk like what most people
think wonderful

368
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,709
no what successful people know you fail
fail fail fail fail and finally you'll

369
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,490
succeed so I've already been failing at
making this game for like a year to now

370
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,660
arm and so I decided you know I can't do
everything I need to realize what I'm

371
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,170
good at and what I'm not good at I need
to contact people that are good at the

372
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:37,000
things that I'm not good at to make this
successful I'm so really I like have

373
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,049
this like kinda change the world type of
attitude right like with this like no

374
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:45,700
one's really doing this right now except
for effector 35 the guys from Victor 35

375
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,460
they do a binary ninja I'm they actually
have a couple RPG games out there that

376
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,110
they used to teach reversing and exploit
development i highly recommend checking

377
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,199
out other stuff is actually really cool
but there they have more like a training

378
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,280
model sort of thing they're not like
selling games are like just putting

379
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,970
games out there for people to play like
I think you like really I think you

380
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,510
could ya gone and i played around with
it a bit arm anyway i would highly

381
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,450
recommend checking that out and so I'm
doing is different from them

382
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,559
not exactly like starting hardcore
reversers or anything like that like I

383
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,530
want to build like the next generation
of sis admins and that sort of thing

384
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:25,450
like we need to hit home earlier with
security and build a security mindset

385
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:30,280
while we're teaching IT so the light is
like I really want to change the world

386
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,230
and i hope you guys do to thank you
