1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
about 130 because this this can kind of
be a little bit short sometimes we'll

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,068
see where it goes

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,280
no I actually really like not being
behind the podium that's as tall as me

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:23,759
and I think that it's true and i'm
actually not using the screen it its

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,050
it's this phenomena of not having slides
so it's a bold move it really is I i

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,000
gave this talk at that Connor earlier
this year and I was wrestling with this

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,750
decision you know I i went to go prepare
my talk and the first thing you do is

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,890
you let you open your laptop and you be
open up PowerPoint and you go to make a

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,690
slide deck and I said how do i how do i
make a slide deck for this like there's

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,190
really not material that would be
anything other than me reading from

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,089
slides

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:00,000
I could just make like a slideshow of
cats and you guys could watch that which

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,559
you know I kind of have regrets that I
didn't do that but I you know I wrestled

14
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,880
with this decision because I you know
it's a professional thing right like I'm

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,500
a professional and I'm giving my
professional opinion and when you were

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,180
professional people ask you where your
slides don't have any does that make me

17
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,100
not a professional and then I realized I
was wrestling with impostor syndrome

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,640
about my talk about impostor syndrome so
so I'm just gonna wing it

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,320
I'm if you guys saw that talk and you
wanted this to be the same i'm too bad

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,100
because this is a totally different talk
you know it's a totally different talk

21
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,390
because i have completely different hand
scribbled notes on a completely

22
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,909
different hotels no paper so so yeah
we're we're just going to have some chat

23
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,259
time about the things that I've picked
up from from my years in this industry

24
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,899
and and in this community and hopefully
it will help you overcome some of the

25
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,500
same challenges that I have im so real
quick

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,140
who is this random person just like with
verbal diarrhea in front of you I am

27
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,880
Jessica McAvoy i am a manager of
deployments and training services at

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,950
up at seven what that means is that i
still do deployments but now they trust

29
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:24,220
me with like seven people that I'm
supposed to grow and mentor and that is

30
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,040
really terrifying like these people
apparently trust me enough to to

31
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,019
consider me a mentor and leader and
that's that's a lot of faith for people

32
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,290
to having me because I'm totally faking
it

33
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,950
I've I've been in this industry for many
years

34
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:50,140
let's just say that my tenure is old
enough to drink and as in all the years

35
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,820
that I've been around i can't say that
I'm faking it any less today than I was

36
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,970
then i actually got here on accident my
studies for those who know me you

37
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,440
already have heard this story I i
studied aerospace engineering i really

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,670
wanted to be a pilot in the air force
found that it couldn't decided to go on

39
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,739
with my studies and at literally became
a rocket scientist yes the jokes just

40
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,950
write themselves and i found out that is
a cool thing and every now and then you

41
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,230
you launch some rockets and sometimes
they they arrive at Mars with great

42
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:32,049
force and and sometimes they make it out
of the Kuiper belts ok but it wasn't

43
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,160
something that I was passionate about
and the people that I was working with

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,560
they they had this side project people
that I knew online they said hey we're

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,970
working on this anonymity project I
heard you can code do you want in on

46
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,570
this

47
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,130
I said sure that sounds interesting i
don't i don't know what that means but

48
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,600
cool and i worked with them on that
project and they said I'm so there's

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,609
this big hacker thing in in the desert
in vegas and we thought they might be

50
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,510
interested in this so why don't we go
hang out there and talk to people about

51
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,730
this i said cool Vegas sounds awesome
i've never been there I've been eating

52
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:15,880
those words ever since but what I found
there was a community of people that

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:22,240
were in in a word inspiring the way that
they thought the way that that they were

54
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,700
excited and pass

55
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,560
shit about what they were doing it was
incredible at the time this was a number

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,620
of years ago it was a very small
community

57
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,290
I know that's hard to picture today it
was a very small very intimate gathering

58
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,100
and everyone was doing something really
cool everyone was doing something really

59
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,780
innovative I didn't understand a word of
what was being said I i had a notebook

60
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,210
with me it was adorable i actually went
to talks and I took notes i still have

61
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,700
that notebook today and one day I'll
look back at it and at some point it

62
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,289
started making sense

63
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,920
I don't know when I learned all this
stuff but I could read my notes and it

64
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,100
was stuff that I do like cool I guess I
learned something because in the process

65
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:14,070
of being here on accident i discovered a
community and in that community i was

66
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,890
living in Texas and at the time there
was apparently a very large Pacific

67
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:26,820
Northwest contingent and after that you
crazy show in the desert 11 year I went

68
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,820
home to Texas and every one of my
friends went home to Seattle I said I

69
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,560
should probably go out there didn't look
at a map i'm actually very fabric of

70
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:45,990
bridges so I had a few regrets but what
I found there was basically as i

71
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,260
described to a friend in my first week
at DEFCON with jobs we we partied all

72
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,730
night but then we had to wake up for
work in the morning and let me tell you

73
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:02,520
if I worked in my twenties at the time
that's that is not something I would

74
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,440
survive today but it was a pretty crazy
time because not only was out partying

75
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,440
every night but I was out partying with
these people that I respected were

76
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,610
really brilliant people and anything a
good leader knows is that are the people

77
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:24,000
that the company that you keep is a
reflection of you you are represented by

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,120
the people that surround you and I
surrounded myself with these people that

79
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,680
I respected that I thought very highly
of and they set the bar really high that

80
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,820
bar was way up here and it turns out
that when the bar is up here

81
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:43,540
you can't help but at least be here late
like you're not even stretching you're

82
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,890
just being carried along with the
current and you end up here and you look

83
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,729
back at that notebook and you're like
when did I learn this

84
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,890
that's that's really weird because
everyone that was around me was really

85
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:02,260
really smart they were way smarter than
me and I i was just going along with the

86
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:09,460
crowd and that right there is an
impostor syndrome along those along that

87
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,479
year I'm you know in my first year there
the more time I spent with them i was

88
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:19,780
learning i was actually learning this
industry and becoming an expert myself I

89
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,580
was establishing my own presence i had
my own ideas I had my own thoughts but

90
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,800
all I could see was that I wasn't as
smart as everyone else and this kind of

91
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:37,090
culminated with i I've been working in
operations security operations for for a

92
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,799
cruise line and you know looking at
their firewalls and running the

93
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,170
vulnerability scans and managing the ids
all those things and we were very small

94
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:52,000
shop because you know a cruise line
doesn't have a lot of systems and I was

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,440
talking with my leadership and they were
thinking you know it would be neat if

96
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,370
this security thing kind of took off and
became its own thing and we can really

97
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,500
see you in like a manager role in the
next year or so and a couple years down

98
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,090
the road definitely get you pushed into
a director role and then we'll probably

99
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,469
just carve this office is whole thing
you know entirely and and just put you

100
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,320
in as a vp over that and a civil whole
I've literally been doing this for six

101
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,219
months

102
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,800
this is the only environment that I know
how can I be an expert on this if I've

103
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,760
never seen anything else and that was an
impostor syndrome that was legitimately

104
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,468
realizing I was not qualified for this
you know path that they were describing

105
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:40,719
to me and so I realized that is
ultimately where I wanted my career ago

106
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,680
so i took the crash course in best
practices i became a consultant doing

107
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,079
tests for

108
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,220
a consultant say that was that was
pretty established at the time and again

109
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,030
I thought this is a great growth
opportunity for me you know i'm

110
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,339
surrounded by these really brilliant
people and i'm going to learn from them

111
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,600
and they're going to mentor me and a
couple of years I have seen so many

112
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,170
different environments that all know
what not to do what to do

113
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,270
it's gonna be great but I didn't think
about is that in addition to me learning

114
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,810
from them that they were going to expect
me to go out on my own and do some of

115
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,430
this work myself me it was terrifying

116
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,990
you know I shadowed a few engagements
and then they were like alright go off

117
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:35,910
do it and you know I go back to go back
home and i'm having cocktails with you

118
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:42,540
know def con with jobs and dan kaminsky
was was the the sounding board for for

119
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,880
this particular rant and I remember that
because in the middle of my freak out

120
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,280
like I mean serious panic attack freak
out I'm like I don't know anything I'm

121
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,610
faking it they're gonna figure this out
how the am I supposed to go to this

122
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,060
engagement in the middle of this freak
out he gave me the best piece of advice

123
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,560
I've ever heard in my life that I've
carried with me all of these years he

124
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,890
looked at me and he says octal we are
all thinking it

125
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:15,510
the trick is figuring it out before your
customer does it's true i thought this

126
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,010
is this is a really interesting
phenomenon and through the years through

127
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:28,710
the years i have come to realize that
we've talked about impostor syndrome in

128
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,020
the context of gender but it's not a
gender specific issue the more that I

129
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,630
talk to my friends the more that I talk
to my colleagues the more that I talked

130
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,430
to my peers the more that I interview
guys with you that under represent

131
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,589
themselves on their resumes the more I
realize this is specific to our industry

132
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:53,490
and not just info sack IT as a whole
technology as a whole and I i believe

133
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,520
truly that the issue is that we're
working with a moving target

134
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,370
you can never be an expert in everything

135
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,740
when I got into this industry you know
phone scanning was a new thing firewalls

136
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,930
checking by signature was a new thing

137
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,770
stateful firewalls weren't even a
glimmer in someone's eye yet like the

138
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,949
technology pool was very small and it
was easy to be an expert in security at

139
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,570
the time because that meant
understanding basic network controls

140
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:28,630
crunchy on the outside squishy in the
middle and unix if you knew unix and

141
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,939
basic networking you could be a security
expert because that was the breadth of

142
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,290
it

143
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:44,199
yes windows existed we don't talk about
those days and it was really easy to to

144
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:51,400
become disenchanted with this problem
because as much as we grew as much as

145
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,800
the industry grew with us as much as
became an industry out of our hobbies we

146
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,469
started to see that the innovation
disappeared we started seeing the same

147
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,360
talks recycled from conference to
conference we started seeing that on our

148
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,550
pen test it wasn't about the new hot
exploit it was about the same freaking

149
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:17,979
blank SI vulnerability that we've seen
on every engagement seriously

150
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,089
eighty-five percent of the customers
that I have been tested blank sa

151
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:27,310
password think that this is not an
exciting problem you know when we're

152
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,150
we're solving the same problem over and
over again and it causes you to become a

153
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,930
little bit disenchanted because you
become jaded and you lose your

154
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:43,150
innovation somewhere around defcon too
many i noticed that i wasn't the only

155
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:48,819
one feeling this way a lot of my peers
were just burned out and no one was

156
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,650
coming in to replace us and that was the
scary part and i looked at us and why

157
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,260
why is there no fresh blood

158
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,830
you know there's been a few people who
have managed to work their way in and

159
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:05,050
and made some good contributions but as
a whole it was the same old farts up on

160
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,709
the stage that we've been seeing for the
last 10 years they said why is that

161
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,440
and then I took a look at our community
through

162
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:19,160
IRC and through our forums and I
realized we're a bunch of assholes like

163
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:26,030
historically collectively as hackers we
are assholes and again this has been

164
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,720
discussed as an issue of gender because
I've noticed that women will come into

165
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,670
the scene and then say your not
supportive you you brush this off all of

166
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:41,900
your responses are STFU noob and lurk
moar and and we're just really horrible

167
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,790
people hope and I don't don't fault me
for this

168
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,319
I've actually used this as a defense and
I believed truly that it was a

169
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,600
legitimate defense when these women
would come with this complaint i said no

170
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,280
no it's not it's not women

171
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,280
we're assholes to everyone that makes it
okay

172
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,410
no it really doesn't um yeah some of
those some of those idiots deserve it

173
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:12,380
you know they come onto the boards and
they're like teach me how to hack or can

174
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,660
you get into my girlfriend's hotmail
account it sucks it's really obnoxious

175
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:24,980
and yet we've we've held onto this idea
nobody needed to teach me nobody showed

176
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,010
me nobody pointed me in the right
direction

177
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,290
I had to fight my way here so why should
you have it any different than I do

178
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:38,870
why should you have the advantage of me
holding your hand through this when I

179
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,000
had to get there by myself

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,290
well you know what when I started out
the technology pool was a kiddie pool

181
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:51,080
it was up to my shins and it's like
saying I learned how to tread water in

182
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,520
the shallow end so you should learn to
swim in the Pacific Ocean with the waves

183
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,890
crashing against you in the current
pulling you down

184
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:04,490
it's such a massive pool these days and
it's such a moving target someone has to

185
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,920
guide people into this industry or
they're going to realize that the movies

186
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,699
portraying hackers on if a movie ever
actually portrayed a hacker in in the

187
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,990
real sense what we actually do from day
to day no one would go to it because

188
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,480
they would fall asleep halfway through
it

189
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,630
blackhat case in point

190
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:31,450
so how do we become a kinder gentler
community

191
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,120
why would we could become kinder gentler
community because the reality is that

192
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:44,530
innovation and a new people bring new
ideas and they see things in our work

193
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,750
that we didn't see they're going to see
the things that we completely missed by

194
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,750
by bringing their new perspective a
movie that I watched last year was the

195
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,940
theory of everything you see this the
story of stephen hawking from the

196
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,170
memoirs of his first wife and from what
I've heard it was fairly accurate so I

197
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:09,040
feel confident in repeating this as a
quote even though it was totally from a

198
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,980
fictional movie but I one of the
students was was questioning him later

199
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:20,140
in life about a book that had recently
published a paper that that effectively

200
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:27,040
contradicted all of his early studies on
the event horizon and he said how how do

201
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,569
you rationalize that how do you justify
the fact that this completely

202
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:37,630
contradicts everything that you have
said he said simple i was wrong because

203
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,290
we can never stop learning we can never
stop innovating we can never stop being

204
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,040
challenged and the people that are going
to challenge us are the people who are

205
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,680
going to take our place when we burn out
so recognize your peers first and

206
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,030
foremost the young kids coming up
straight out of school that kid asking

207
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,030
if you can hack his girlfriend's hotmail
yes they're obnoxious

208
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,200
yes we're tired of seeing the same
question over and over again the point

209
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,319
them in the right direction and if you .
enough of them in the right direction

210
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,780
you'll find a few of them stick but go
further than recognizing your peers

211
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,379
beyond just recognizing them when they
have an idea

212
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:20,020
repeat it and credit them for it I know
this is a really novel idea but I'm it's

213
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,339
something again that's been practiced in
the context of gender with women doing

214
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,629
this in meetings to be heard because it
was something that especially

215
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:34,480
male-dominated fields we had to do but
in this industry of innovation where we

216
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,559
need those new voices

217
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:43,249
this holds for everyone if someone has a
really good idea repeated oh hey Jeff

218
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:46,519
was saying that he was thinking we could
do this and I thought that's a great

219
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:51,409
idea and we can expand on it in this way
and then Amy says yeah you know what I

220
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:53,960
had some ideas to go on Jeff's idea

221
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,330
here's how we can implement it and Bob
their boss says oh wow yeah just

222
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,230
actually really brilliant I'm Jeff why
don't you go ahead and organize that and

223
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,440
you know me and maybe you're going to
sit there and help him and help him get

224
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,179
there and we're going to be there when
he says while this was actually a really

225
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:15,379
stupid idea a theory is a theory

226
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,139
sometimes your theory is proven correct
sometimes your theory is wrong sometimes

227
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:24,439
your idea just doesn't hold water

228
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,269
that's the reality of it and when you
start saying things like I'm an idiot

229
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:34,429
no one I don't know what i'm talking
about i'm just i'm miserable failure we

230
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:38,539
have to be there for our peers to say no
it was actually a really solid theory

231
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:43,669
let's just take a step back and
reevaluate it and see where it leads you

232
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:46,909
know obviously didn't go the direction
we thought it was going to go but it's

233
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:51,200
going to go somewhere this is still a
really good path so let's get you back

234
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,649
on it we have to teach our our peers on
and we have to mentor the people that

235
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:02,629
are coming up to encourage disciplined
risk-taking I'll get questions at the

236
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:08,629
end we want to encourage discipline
risk-taking in our peers in our

237
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:13,580
colleagues and help them bring
themselves up and we have to do this by

238
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:19,939
handing over control we have to give
them the opportunities to succeed which

239
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:25,549
is also the opportunity to fail and when
they do fail and it will happen we all

240
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:30,289
fail every single one of us has failed
at some point we have to be a safety net

241
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:34,908
and we have to be there to catch them
and help course correct and get things

242
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:41,269
back on track we need to take risks on
the new guy and mentorship is beyond

243
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:46,700
just being kind it is helping them
brainstorm it's when they don't have an

244
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,530
idea and we're trying to spark that
innovation

245
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,620
because we know that they have a
different perspective so if we get them

246
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,790
talking about it and maybe flowchart
some of their ideas and show how they

247
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,110
could possibly implement this it will
encourage them to innovate and be more

248
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,870
creative and bring that new perspective
blank page syndrome is a bitch when you

249
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,610
are staring at a blank page whether it
be your conference talks submission or

250
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:17,100
you know the next project you feature
that that you're gonna add your product

251
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,080
it sucks

252
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,790
no one likes to stare at a blank paper
we need to have those conversations we

253
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,850
need to have those conversations with
each other and we need to be willing to

254
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,610
accept that call that ideas that come
out of those conversations collectively

255
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,439
we arrived at it but whoever blurted it
out it's their idea and they get to run

256
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,940
with it even if we help them lead them
there we can't take credit for other

257
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:48,180
people's ideas one of the other things
that I've used in in helping my mentees

258
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,640
is rubber duck programming have you
heard this for those that are not coders

259
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,590
the idea behind rubber duck programming
is that if you explain the problem to a

260
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,570
rubber duck line-by-line you explain
your code as you're debugging it by

261
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,070
explaining it to the rubber duck you're
going to find your logic errors it

262
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,639
actually turns out to be a great
teaching resource as well when I first

263
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,530
started at rapid7 I was tasked with
teaching our advanced course that

264
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:22,200
involved you know API and Ruby which I
was comfortable with and sequel which i

265
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,820
think i took a sequel class once and I
fell asleep so I thought I had it I

266
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,010
thought I understood it and I went to go
teach it and I just froze so I called up

267
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,910
when the senior guys on my team who
taught it before over lunch we broke for

268
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,200
lunch and I just called him up real
quick and I said explain this to me line

269
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,540
by line and he did the whole lunch hour
every query he broke them down and then

270
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:50,520
I got back on the call with my students
and I regurgitate it to them and we both

271
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,020
learned it by the end of that session we
both understood it because teaching it

272
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,220
to a rubber duck or your dog or your
colleague or someone that's coming up in

273
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,300
the industry

274
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,159
all of these things will help you to
learn

275
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:13,510
and by processing that much like a men
in black you have old busted me and the

276
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:19,000
new hot is that these guys it's hard not
being the new hotness

277
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,710
it sucks sometimes we're going to get
old our knowledge or expertise is going

278
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,120
to become irrelevant

279
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,350
he who dies with the most exploits still
dies at the end of it when the applause

280
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,429
dies down

281
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:39,250
no one cares that you wrote an amazing
exploit in 1998 sure it might have led

282
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,270
to some other innovations and people
might remember you once or twice in

283
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:51,520
passing but that's not your legacy i'll
leave you with with this story a friend

284
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,940
of mine in the security community a
number of years ago really young guy

285
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,710
very brilliant very inspirational had a
huge impact on our community very

286
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:05,410
integral part of our of our community
had passed away in a car accident and it

287
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,880
was rough you know he was he was the
youngest of us we didn't actually know

288
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,110
how young he was I met him at a bar he
said it's my 21st birthday

289
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:20,439
I've been waiting for this day for 19
years so we're pretty sure that he was

290
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,060
somewhere in his early twenties even his
family got his age wrong on his obituary

291
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:31,300
the first time who he was a very very
young guy but had made a huge impact in

292
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:38,290
his time and even thinking back on him
it was eleven twelve years later I i

293
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,940
remember at his funeral

294
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,560
the room was probably four times the
size of this room at the funeral home

295
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,290
and it was standing room only

296
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,970
it was absolutely packed all the rows
were packed and his brother had come up

297
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:58,270
and was talking about how he would he
would bring his brother out on i.t gigs

298
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:03,129
dropping cables building servers and his
brother learned from him he was he was a

299
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:08,170
mentor and he did it in this very
light-hearted way that that really made

300
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:14,770
an impression and you know we go to the
the the burial and there's just a line

301
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,580
of cars miles miles

302
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,889
as far as the eye can see this huge line
of cars with their blinkers on and you

303
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,399
know we laid him to rest and we went to
our friends house and we were just

304
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,120
reminiscing about all of the things that
he contributed to us all of the changes

305
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,299
he made in our lives and it was really
inspiring and the one thing that that

306
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:40,970
left me with is the knowledge that you
are remembered by those whose lives you

307
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,860
change at the end of the day it's not
that exploit that you wrote or that tool

308
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,229
that you published or any of the things
that you did the reason that people

309
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:58,130
remember you is because you change their
life if one person can say on the day

310
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,789
that i have passed that she changed my
life then I know that my legacy is going

311
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:08,059
to survive me thank you

312
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:24,049
hey get a quick question over today for
everyone down for me to say more awesome
