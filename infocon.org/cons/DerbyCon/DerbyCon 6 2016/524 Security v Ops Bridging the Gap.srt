1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
great well i'm gonna go ahead and get
started is pretty much about two o'clock

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:13,230
so i just start out so you know we've
all had that you know that point where

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,520
we work and securities interesting saw
this is a talk that was about 45 minutes

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,840
talking trying to jam it into a stable
talk so so this the long story short is

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,509
when I your insecurities you're on your
ear hearing your software in your group

6
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,000
and you get an alert and you go
immediately you jump into in into

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,809
instant response you're determining the
cause and it turns out to be that

8
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,860
missing patch or that outdated
application it's still out there or

9
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,289
maybe just bad configuration that you
can you say and what happens when this

10
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,250
goes on indefinitely one of your
co-workers of one of my co-workers will

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,190
say oh my gosh only opposite just done
their job and patch that machine and fix

12
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,120
that configuration we wouldn't have this
problem and be sitting here doing this

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,408
response for like you know eight hours
or twelve hours or however long

14
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,880
uh-huh however long it took and how many
guys have ever said that I heard anyone

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,298
say that just just wanting a couple yeah
so um you know what happens in that you

16
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,009
know occurs is lot of times i've already
gotten no ops and I'm eventually you

17
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,610
know after everything is calm down
wander over and reach be talking to them

18
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,060
and their sit there griping about
security that how security is always

19
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,400
yelling at them and complaining about
option complaining how bad offices and

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,400
that security just says expect opposite
fix all their problems that security has

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,869
a top should be fixing and so suddenly
both sides since the other group is

22
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,159
completely incompetent and as a result
neither group can work or will work each

23
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,689
other will work with each other and how
many sound that sounds million where you

24
00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,210
work now or places you work in the past
yeah so um you know we've all lived

25
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,559
through this and we've all are living
through this and so on i decided to try

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,590
and do a little bit of talk about what
i've $FULLPHONENUM what i've seen has

27
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,160
caused this problem and some of the
methods I've seen that help resolve this

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,030
problem and

29
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,940
basically calling security a and
operations bridging the gap so just a

30
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,560
little bit about me I've been about 15
years in infosec I've done a variety of

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,750
jobs in information security

32
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,890
I'm i got some great letters after my
name that means something somebody I'm

33
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,790
and generally my biggest problem that I
that the things i want to do or flat

34
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,880
vastly greater than the time I have to
do them in on but you know what ideally

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,670
when you know you have these two groups
is that they really should be working

36
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,500
out together but arm often the problem
is that they're barely civil toward each

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,550
other while they're harboring some kind
of deep respect and disrespect or

38
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,220
outright contempt toward each other and
so at best we have a tenuous line of

39
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,620
communication and cooperation one that
really can break at any any moment and

40
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,819
what was interesting is that a talks
earlier in this conference of I both

41
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,220
Carlos Perez and Jason Street mentioned
that the that this communication is the

42
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,750
one of the critical things on that needs
to happen between operations and

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,620
security

44
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,430
so what are some of the reasons for this
friction well I believe that there are

45
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,799
both fundamental issues that are going
on on and some technical issues that are

46
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,780
causes divided and so to really uh talk
about how do we build this bridge

47
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,280
between these two groups let's just
start a first with the fundamentals

48
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,480
so first the first fundamental that we
have to really go over is bad staff

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,480
structure and so what do I mean by that

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,920
on what i mean by bad staff structures
we have a repeat we have two long lines

51
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,890
of authoritative of communication that
go way up before their two sides

52
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,890
actually talk to each other and it

53
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,280
and so these two groups are stovepipe
they operate not on an isolation and

54
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,599
this really causes problems between
communication between notifications and

55
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,469
coordination between the two groups and
so what happens is since one group

56
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,330
doesn't actually have to talk to the
other group on they often leave the

57
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,948
other group a decisions that affect both
groups so this causes resentment and

58
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,240
friction and this especially happens in
places without strong leadership that

59
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,160
direct or demand or require that kind of
a coordination between the two of them

60
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,160
it also this kind of structure also
presents a sari prevents resolution of

61
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,080
disagreements you know like 12 kids
disagree i'm an arbitrator usually a

62
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,909
parent or guardian is close by but in
this case you know how long are far too

63
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,479
options security have to go to get
resolution it takes you know escalation

64
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,639
escalation escalation and the longer and
further that is the less likely things

65
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,550
will be brought up to be resolved and so
again conflict and resentment build up

66
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:14,810
on another challenge is when on security
and compliance or bundled together and

67
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,000
many industries compliances is critical
to meet regulations but the problem

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,410
comes when compliance tasks are placed
into the security team and security is

69
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,849
viewed now as compliance and once
compliance has met no one feels the need

70
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:33,680
to do any more security and we know
compliance is not the same as security

71
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,300
so how do we fix these two things well
first we need to change your step

72
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,910
uh so sorry fix these two things so
first we need to change our staff

73
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,910
structure by moving the junction between
the two groups lower into the hierarchy

74
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,610
we can do this physically or we can do
this virtually with the CCB or some kind

75
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,260
of single manager of but most
importantly that Junction needs to be

76
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:07,789
some so have some kind of authoritative
a capability this Junction doesn't

77
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,419
always replace it does not replace
direct communication between the two

78
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:17,270
groups at the bottom but I it does allow
for shorter of shorter try

79
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,039
full time for resolution for
communication for coordination where

80
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,480
when one group had it feels like their
priorities don't match up the request of

81
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,620
the other group and allows for a shorter
time period to work those things out

82
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:37,729
the second thing we need to do is move
compliance out of security security ops

83
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,430
should work together to be compliant but
with the compliance is integrated in

84
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:49,850
security and often prevents an objective
viewpoint by compliance to truly audit

85
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,960
what security is doing and what ops are
doing to meet the regulations or the

86
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:00,140
compliance requirements of the
organization and so if it's a-so its

87
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,750
integrated again it's hard for them to
be objective

88
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,600
the second issue the second fundamental
issue that are often causes conflict is

89
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,010
that the goals are thought are our
thoughts are bogging ille operations

90
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,349
once things to work they value uptime
functionality through put security on

91
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,670
the other hand we value what our
namesake says security protection

92
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:28,310
authorization authentication permissions
validations verifications but not

93
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,750
necessarily restrictions because I think
we need to view security as we want to

94
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,460
authorize people who have authorized
access to perform authorized activity

95
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,870
all the time

96
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:44,450
the challenge is the road to achieving
these two goals isn't always in parallel

97
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:49,250
and a large effort needs to be put forth
to make to achieve the achieve that kind

98
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:58,340
of cooperation that kind of operational
of conduct capability so not pressing my

99
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,570
slides here sorry

100
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,700
so the suggestion really then is to that
working together requires that kind of

101
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,680
court coordination cooperation and some
compromise management really needs to

102
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,030
get involved needs to provide the
guidance and set priorities for the

103
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,409
entire for both groups so that they know
what they need to go what understand

104
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,430
their level of risk that the
organization is a

105
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:27,370
is ready to accept so that both groups
have that kind of the those boundaries

106
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,030
to operate within so they know where
they can go know what they can ask of

107
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,030
the other group and know when they kind
of need to go through and get a

108
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:41,890
exceptions also operation and security
need to align their efforts with the

109
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,960
organization's mission and goals for
instance if you're running store and

110
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,560
your advertising the fact that you have
the fastest checkout times faster than

111
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,209
your competitors and insecurity comes
along and adds a step to that process is

112
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,790
that really in line with the company's
goals it's not going to get a it's going

113
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,300
to have a very hard time getting that
approved if it really has a chance at

114
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,130
all so creating an operationally secure
environment takes a lot of time and

115
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,120
effort i'm not saying that this is easy
or simple or one-step process but it is

116
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:20,560
a that it has to be a focused continual
effort so the third fundamental issue is

117
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,939
really the question of who's doing what
and this comes down to a lack of

118
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,220
guidance on a lack of the policy that
are referred to as the last in the last

119
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,680
point on one of the first things is does
each group have their own procedures for

120
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,300
the same situation and you know for
server goes down and the security team

121
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,810
runs off and they say oh my gosh we got
to see if it was a security incident was

122
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,589
this some kind of it on they start going
into a little bit of their incident

123
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,360
restocked response procedures

124
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,150
meanwhile options running off saying
well we got to get the server backup and

125
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,650
so you know options trying to free you
know to troubleshoot the the crash

126
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,930
trying to restart the services there on
you know they're installing or

127
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,880
uninstalling on patches and and software
and applications and you know security

128
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,350
is over here trying to get logs and
maybe it's a vm so ops just goes you

129
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,400
know goes revert and suddenly I
securities gone what the heck just

130
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,689
happened to my logs and so they're
stepping all over each other both trying

131
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,139
to do their jobs because there they have
different uh

132
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:31,689
a proper procedures for the same
situation so on and so they're all the

133
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:36,368
challenge that comes in is there may be
confusion over reporting and and

134
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:42,999
responsibilities taken that same server
situation security may be reporting that

135
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:46,179
as an incident because they feel hey
this is something that's wrong and in so

136
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,230
now you have an incident response report
you have it's going up through that

137
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,939
channel but meanwhile options just
saying oh it's a downtime thing you know

138
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:58,779
so it's another tick on the down time
maybe that's reportable maybe it's not

139
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:04,389
suddenly each of those reports each of
those uh follow-throughs and follow ups

140
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:10,660
are generating different kinds of
responses from management on and who's

141
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,829
stepping on who's who's supposed to give
what information who and that's causing

142
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:24,608
a additional confusion so on one of the
examples of from my from my organization

143
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:30,160
was we had a we had a new tool that was
a that something could it was doing a

144
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,519
really good job at detecting down adword
downloads just from your browser from

145
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,559
going to browsers and so we're like hey
this tool can you do auto remediation

146
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,910
can you know detect it go but we're just
wiping it out this minute we detected

147
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,589
well we didn't really have there was no
actual uh policy or procedure in place

148
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:56,649
to to do to do that auto removal and
while both sides and that in that

149
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,350
situation said yet that makes sense

150
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,759
it took a long time to actually get
those procedures in place to find the

151
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,160
right person to sign off on that to get
both sides to agree on for something

152
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,639
that everyone agreed yeah we probably
should just auto remove that stuff

153
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,019
because it shouldn't be there

154
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:19,600
and now that we have a good capability
let's just turn that on and so it's that

155
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,039
top cover that policy cover that was in
place prior to that so that goes right

156
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:29,199
into this suggested solution which is
armed designating roles and

157
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:36,099
responsibilities and developing SOPs so
that those SNP's are they're ready for

158
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,640
you

159
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,460
to apply to situations as they come up
but the other important part of sops and

160
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:48,280
and policies that aren't written out is
that you need to also have a methodology

161
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,329
for those situations that don't meet
something that's already written so how

162
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:58,300
to handle the exceptions have a handle
on those odd situations that may not may

163
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:05,589
fall out of scope with what is already
in place so now that you've gotten your

164
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,970
your fundamental issues that we talked
about the fundamental fundamental issues

165
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,690
of pillars really are there how do we
really build the bridge how do we build

166
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,690
that on the things that really now
smooth the communication between the two

167
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:25,900
groups on so one of the first things
that is just a well-worn path that

168
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,840
always seems to come up it is the
constant of a disagreement over scanning

169
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,090
and patching and security figurations I
you know how this works security does a

170
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,720
vulnerability scan they're doing a full
ability assessment and they basically

171
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,860
take the results bundle them up wrap
them up there over the wall and say ops

172
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,430
could you fix all that and then the next
week they come back to run the same skin

173
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,400
to look at and go up they still haven't
fixed it and they bundle it up throw it

174
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:58,060
over there again on and meanwhile
options on the other saying of options

175
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,930
on the other hand gun you know why you
yelling at us about this you know what

176
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,290
what they always the same old story the
same old thing these things are critical

177
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:10,930
on you know that particular
configuration breaks the application on

178
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,829
you know and you know both you know the
other thing i heard a lot when i talk to

179
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,610
cops people that you know security every
time they come over about a

180
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,300
vulnerability about a configuration they
just all they do is they just basically

181
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,109
they just talk down to us they just
condescending like you know don't you

182
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,340
know how to do this it's so small it's
so easy you should know how to do this

183
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,300
and the ops hates that Nate once they
start hearing that tone coming from

184
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,359
security they just go you know what I
don't hear them they're going to talk

185
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,960
down to me like I'm a first-year admin
and you know I don't want to talk to

186
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,360
them

187
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,700
so uh you know we really need to stop
that kind of cycle on and figure out how

188
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,160
to really make this work a better for us
so the first thing and I that we should

189
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,149
that we should everyone should have and
understand it sometimes resources are

190
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:00,140
challenging but i'm going to talk about
it several times that really building

191
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,430
and using testbed I mean a testament is
really going to save your your your

192
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,180
capabilities your ability to work
together as an environment

193
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,630
l just a lot and I'm going to repeat
that several times now whatever testbed

194
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,220
you can build build it if it if it
emulates you know one server and one

195
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,170
workstation in your 2500 the device
environment okay at least you have

196
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:28,339
something something to at least rollout
you know patches and configs and do some

197
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:33,200
kind of testing but with nothing then
your test basically becomes your

198
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,730
operational environment we know with
this has been said before that is not a

199
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,459
good thing to use your op environment as
your test fit we're not Microsoft so

200
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:52,790
that's an old joke they don't do that
anymore but as much alright so developed

201
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,120
a test plan for patching into for
patching and configuration changes so

202
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,390
you can deploy patches and make config
changes in an environment so that it

203
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:06,649
doesn't impact your users or your
customers and so that uh and so that

204
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:10,070
you're able to determine the operational
impact of the security impact of the

205
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,820
changes prior to rolling them out the
second thing you need to do need to do

206
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,160
is review as security what we need to do
is your view and prioritize the patches

207
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,079
that are that are that we found to be
deficient arms just let stopped on the

208
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,140
whole bundle over the wall and expecting
ops to fix everything

209
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,550
so let's take the time to review what
was found and prioritize what needs to

210
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:37,640
be patched and protected we do that with
whatever intelligence we can gather what

211
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,870
are what we know they are advertised at
what we know our advertisers well we

212
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,620
know our adversaries thereafter and what
vulnerabilities that are currently being

213
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,480
exploited on and so this means really
communicating with operations so that

214
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,480
they understand why one week we may all
be all up in arms

215
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,360
about the ph CP vulnerability on the
customer facing a server and the next

216
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,000
week we're screaming about microsoft
macros that are hitting HR so there you

217
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,140
know we don't without context they just
think security is being on a multi

218
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:18,569
personality a schizophrenic and so uh
but we provide them like hey look we

219
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,750
noticed this is going on here they
understand what's going on and so we

220
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:27,720
have to temper that so provide them
context and priority on the the things

221
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,799
that we find the deficiencies also
provide suggestions on fixing the

222
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,679
problem on if you idea identify problem
within ops or within the areas of their

223
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,500
responsibilities engage with them to
find a solution for example of you know

224
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,890
a lot of times vulnerability scanners
will just say hey you're Adobe's two

225
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,940
revisions behind for that you know their
options going on well i know i deployed

226
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,919
the patch so you have to help work with
them to find out which version applies

227
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,419
to wishing machine and sometimes even
what profile directory on that machine

228
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,770
the vulnerability scanner maybe maybe
targeting sometimes I vulnerability

229
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,179
scanner just looks for certain dll with
a certain version on the entire CD drive

230
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:17,190
and it's hidden in some directory that
ops you know that that some install put

231
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:24,600
somewhere that ops doesn't know about to
help me figure that out on and then

232
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,918
finally help them develop alternative
mitigations we all know that there are

233
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,000
some applications and some
configurations and some things in the

234
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,350
environment that we just that just have
to be that way to help them to develop

235
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,570
work with them to develop things that
still protect uh what needs to be

236
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,530
protected

237
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,520
uh while you know even though we can't
change the primary issue

238
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,360
um OH finally when things do improve
make sure ops kicks credit for what they

239
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,070
did not just say hey look we made this
place place better by beating up on ops

240
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,840
until they did what we said no but when
everyone has a stake in done fixing the

241
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,649
problem

242
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,370
everyone has buy into the fine

243
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:11,739
solution and everyone should get the
kudos for the second technical problem

244
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:18,730
to overcome really is when ops employees
new servers or new capabilities arm and

245
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,530
that deployment is being driven fast and
then securities comfortable with or even

246
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,129
without securities knowledge you know
that just happens you know you're

247
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,400
monitoring your firewall and you're like
whoa what's this traffic coming from

248
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,910
this IP I don't even know about you call
up pops and they're like oh that's the

249
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:40,809
new management server for the ipad you
going a what server be what iPads so uh

250
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:44,889
you know but a lot of times those things
are not you know the opposite and so to

251
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,860
wake up and one morning and decide to
just put the server on basically

252
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,639
somebody came down from on high and said
I want this I want it now and make it

253
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:59,080
happen and offices scrambling to meet a
customer or management requirements and

254
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,080
so we we're seen on you know we're
seeing as basically the holdup because

255
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,990
rolled up business were holding up
progress and holding up customer

256
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:15,280
requirements on so this is again a great
a situation that really builds up uh

257
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,379
build up in foster resentment and
frustration between the group to group

258
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,940
so how do we limit this damage well a
couple things first

259
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:31,420
again test that uses a lot you know use
it to ops and make sure that what

260
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,380
they're getting works in the way that
they wanted to insecurity can perform a

261
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,850
reasonable security evaluation to
determine how to monitor activity how to

262
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,469
secure the device and the two of them
work together so that actually works a

263
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,900
works in a manner that needs to that
meets the requirement then this is where

264
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:55,270
a good CCB good configuration control
board or whatever you want to call it is

265
00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:00,190
really gold because you're able to bring
down if you do this right op spring

266
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,720
security in as early as possible into
the problem the process of deploying

267
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,960
these new things deploying these tools
or or application for our changes and so

268
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,100
the CCB really should ensure that all
parties that need to be involved are

269
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,980
tied into the life cycle from

270
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:25,049
requirements planning to engineering to
deployment to retirement on and so each

271
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:30,570
party has their input and can work
toward a common solution and so I want

272
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,290
to also say that part of that common
solution is making sure she's security

273
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:38,490
understands the problem that Ops is
trying to solve I've seen security put

274
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:44,429
so many restrictions on a new
application or new system that ops can't

275
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,360
actually use it to do what they wanted
to do well now you've just wasted a

276
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,250
whole lot of ops money and a whole lot
of ops time to solve nothing on and so

277
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:59,340
again resentment on and what are the
other thing that happens is you end up

278
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,909
with shadow IT those things that uh
customers and a officer whoever start

279
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:09,929
doing on the side that you don't know
anything about because they need to get

280
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:17,820
their job done so we also just real
quick need to acknowledge that there are

281
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,189
times and when the requirement for new
Apple system is comes to hot so high or

282
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:28,140
so much we needed that you just have to
roll it out and this is again where you

283
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,049
have to work with ops to understand
what's going on

284
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:36,840
get whatever a thing is they're out in
deployed yet be able to work with them

285
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,100
so you can come from behind and say okay
now that we've got it out there let's

286
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,990
figure out how to secure it how and
doing it in a manner that still meets

287
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,309
the requirement or still gets the thing
job done so the final technical

288
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:55,710
challenges when security to supply a
security that's when we decide to

289
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:02,309
implement new tools or new process and
so we're doing we're stoked about this

290
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:05,639
whoo hoo more security more tools more
bells and whistles more blinky lights

291
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,890
more things in clothes off and protected
all op ceases more things breaking more

292
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,090
customers calling more you yelling from
on high because something isn't working

293
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:20,309
so what do we do to resolve this again

294
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:26,668
test fit on it from our site we when we
want this we gotta get our ops involved

295
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:30,690
earlier in the planning the big thing is
if we can eat our own dog

296
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:39,510
food on you know we we deployed a new uh
host-based security system are not hbss

297
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:45,180
something completely different but
that's a number on but we you know and

298
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,960
so we made sure that that client was
deployed to our machines first now the

299
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,300
other thing when you eat your own dog
food

300
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,740
don't take shortcuts around it you know
we do you really have to make sure you

301
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,710
emulate the user we like for instance
who uses no script on in your browser

302
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,710
you know those of you do or something
similar you know we're perfect line

303
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,220
gonna allow that don't allow that you
know and clicking that nine times very

304
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,350
very wait webpage that we go to

305
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,490
well guess what your users don't like
that they don't want they want you know

306
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,900
they don't want to click anything we
want to just go so if you know so make

307
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,500
sure we evaluate in the mindset of the
users when we either on dog food and

308
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,880
then do a phased implementation so that
you can roll it back quickly or get it

309
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,610
back it out something bad is going on so
I'm pretty much out of time so i'm not

310
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:37,020
going to go through my additional tips
but i do want to wrap up by saying that

311
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,730
really uh want to thank a couple people
talk to Jason Street I talk to young

312
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,990
lady named k and co worker Brian who
really helped by providing some

313
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:52,080
additional input into this and then uh
the key to all these solutions is

314
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,510
communication both Jason and Carlos
Perez talk about when the two groups

315
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,220
even when the two groups are hostile to
each other on humble communication will

316
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,850
break through that hostility making sure
that both groups understand that they're

317
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,230
on the same team and there were and that
working together makes everyone looks

318
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:15,210
good on once that happens that really is
what starts to lower the barriers that

319
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,820
ends helped start the process to
building the bridge so that's my talk if

320
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:26,010
you have any questions we may have a
couple minutes for questions arm so yes

321
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:51,870
right thing ever i have not I hadn't
really heard of that but that's a good

322
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,678
idea

323
00:25:52,679 --> 00:26:27,179
write it down so we so yes require so
the scorecard is such you know doesn't

324
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,419
have doesn't carry a punishment but it
does carry reward

325
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,830
I like that that's good so one more

326
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,419
alright last one yeah so one of the
things that's more than some operations

327
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:50,309
something so try to find somebody in the
office on that has an interest towards

328
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:58,529
your pasta that they can help foster
that relationship building right there

329
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:09,719
okay cool alright well thanks appreciate
that thanks
