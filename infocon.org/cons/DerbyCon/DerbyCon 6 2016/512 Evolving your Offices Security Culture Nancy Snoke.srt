1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,050
hi I'm Nancy smoke and today i'm talking
about evolving yours opposite security

2
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:29,970
culture a quick Who am I better

3
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,239
ok I'm this year i started my own
business magic security LLC and we focus

4
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,660
on finding and fixing vulnerabilities
and web and mobile applications have

5
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,250
worked as a pen tester and developer
before from my educational standpoint i

6
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,910
have my PhD in computer engineering and
physics a minor in math I've dropped out

7
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,029
of my PhD program i'm on twitter and you
could email me check out my company Meg

8
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,030
website or my personal blog

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,470
alright so I'm this story based talk and
all the stories i'm going to be saying

10
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,470
are true but I changed everyone's name
in them

11
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:22,770
oh i am sorry that my body so but i
changed all the names here to protect

12
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,048
the insecure people talking about so I
stole my students from the atrocity

13
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,630
archives by charles stross good book

14
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,189
so the first story i'm going to be Bob
or mr. Howard and the only other

15
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,158
characters going to be Andy who's a
really good manager who sometimes he

16
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,630
doesn't understand theoretical stuff so
this one's a failure that should never

17
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:53,669
have happened and it starts with my
first day at a job and so my new boss

18
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,850
comes up to me and he and he's like hey
Bob we're so happy you're here and we

19
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,100
really want take advantage of all your
security background so for your first

20
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,728
assignment could you come up with a list
of proposals of how we can improve our

21
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,030
security here

22
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,560
and I'm like yeah great because that's a
good opportunity i mean you can actually

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,450
show what do you think they need to do
and so I don't ask any questions

24
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:29,260
I just does sit down start doing the
task i end up with a 50-page probably

25
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,090
paper of things they need to improve
complete with citations as to why this

26
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,580
is the best practice and so I wanted on
email hey Andy

27
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,150
here's the proposal you wanted thanks
Bob and I wait and I wait and I don't

28
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,370
hear and so like hey Andy did you ever
read that he's like well i started

29
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,769
reading it but you know I didn't get
much past the abstract yes it had an

30
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:04,750
abstract but and so what nobody ever
read it and so nobody ever did any of

31
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,239
those improvements so they wanted to

32
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:17,859
1 2 next introduce doing a post-mortem
when you have a failure which I normally

33
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:24,640
do by asking a couple questions and I
chose four of them here that I think are

34
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,768
generally good you can always add more
but yeah I what is the best thing what's

35
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:34,600
the worst thing what could have been
improved and what could I have done

36
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,850
differently and in this case the best
thing was that i researched and figured

37
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,410
out what happened and the worst thing
was obviously the no.1 read it

38
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,709
so what could I have done differently

39
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,100
or sorry i'm at what could be improved

40
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,670
I could have probably made it shorter
clear and focused on one or two

41
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:05,579
important changes and as to where I
could have done differently i have been

42
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,020
curious and ask more questions because
they may have had one or two things that

43
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,710
they were really interested in and then
they would have been really into doing

44
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:19,650
those changes as well as I should have
known who I was talking to and they want

45
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,200
a security person and that's why should
have kept it short and clear and focused

46
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,140
on the business because that's what they
want it so this is the story that sort

47
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,090
of got me interested in security culture
and so from here we do a brief segue

48
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,909
into what theoretical information there
is on security culture and changing it

49
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,910
just for a few minutes so to start with
what is culture and if you go to google

50
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,250
and type it in this is what you get the
behaviors beliefs values and ideas are

51
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,030
symbols of a group that are passed along
by communication invitation from one

52
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:03,090
generation to the next and if you do the
same thing for security you get the

53
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,729
state of being free from danger or
threat so we can quickly derive security

54
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:16,800
culture is the behaviors beliefs values
and symbols of a group that helped you

55
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,870
be free from danger and there's one
important word here and that's group

56
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,690
yes works on this so you can't have any
culture without a group of people or

57
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:33,450
group of something so we could quickly
and Alice eyes the culture of Der Beek

58
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,340
on which would be subtly different from
the culture of the random people on

59
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,340
Louisville we besides the demographics
which are obviously different we

60
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,210
probably have other more obscure traits
that are different i bet we would have

61
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,969
better passwords than the random people
on the street for example

62
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:58,479
and another important thing to note is
that there are you have the culture of

63
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,998
derby county as a whole but they're also
different subgroups here and some of

64
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:08,499
those subgroups are these sponsors the
organizers staff speakers and attendees

65
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:14,379
and each of these groups will have a
different subculture so when you're

66
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:21,159
trying to change culture if you have a
strong subculture and a week main

67
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:27,159
culture it's very hard to change because
the subcultures fight back of the

68
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:29,169
smaller groups

69
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:35,859
alright so next I was so there's a group
hierarchy and i made this up i have no

70
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,839
clue how derby cons actually is

71
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,069
I was just making it up but in the
groove party hierarchy depending on

72
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:48,759
where you are you get two different
actions so and they actually have a nice

73
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,569
way of identifying their hierarchy here
to some extent i know the color-coded

74
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:56,559
shirts so the people the purple shirts
are the ones who are supposed to be

75
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:59,499
missing with the cameras if i came over
there are doing it

76
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:04,869
somebody would probably stop me because
that's outside of my role in the

77
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:08,409
hierarchy as a speaker I'm not supposed
to come over and mess with the cameras

78
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:14,438
so usually I need to stay within your
hierarchy or else something bad happens

79
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:22,389
and so I just made this episode that the
organizers telling staff what to do and

80
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,169
the staff tell about the sponsors you
know where to set up in the speaker's

81
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:32,769
way to speak and tell the attendees have
a lineup in lines to go to talks and the

82
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:36,879
sponsors I so having some influence to
attendees because they can incentivize

83
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:44,469
you to change your behavior you know
cooled wrong and the speakers can change

84
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:48,219
behavior possibly by influencing you
want some of this day although that's

85
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:52,119
probably not as often as the
incentivizing of the sponsors

86
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:59,229
alright so what do you actually do to
change culture you can change one of

87
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,688
three things the people the technology
or the policies

88
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:06,439
and by changing the people i mean
literally changing the people in the

89
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:14,360
group so taking away people adding more
people etc so a good example here let's

90
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,989
say you have a group who plays axis and
allies every saturday and you add two

91
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:25,039
new people to the group and the to be a
new people like axis and allies but they

92
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,308
may also like the game betrayal the
house on the hill so all of a sudden you

93
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:31,879
become the group who plays axis and
allies or betray out the house on the

94
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,219
hill instead of just the group replace X
analysis now if you change the

95
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:42,110
technology in my example the technology
they were using was a board game you can

96
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,089
change it to offer something that they
want to play an online game or land

97
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,740
games or gaming system you change the
technology and that does change the

98
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:59,089
culture now policies can be written or
unwritten and this my example gaming

99
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,050
group obviously doesn't have written
rules but they might have an unwritten

100
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,349
rule about say bringing beer to
someone's house every time you go over

101
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:13,790
them so in that case it might change if
say somebody goes on a diet say hey I

102
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,149
need light beer instead of bringing
regular ba you start bringing light beer

103
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:25,040
that's the new policy and now as brief
note on policy enforcement quick story

104
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,029
this is at the same job as my first
story I had a job assignment to write

105
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:40,550
some policies for pci compliance and
secure coding and I was really excited

106
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,969
about it because there's all sorts of
problems in the code is like this is

107
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,500
gonna really change everything so I
didn't find the same fault is the first

108
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,300
1i got it down to five sentences which
if you followed them you might have to

109
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,240
read the more detailed descriptions of
those sentences you didn't know what I

110
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,329
meant but you told him you'd be secure

111
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:05,089
and I was so excited and everyone signed
off said they read them but then the

112
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:06,439
code didn't change

113
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:11,360
nobody did it and why because there was
no enforcement nothing positive or

114
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,230
negative happened one way or the other
so you don't have enforcement then

115
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:24,589
people will just ignore the policies and
as a general rule negative enforcement

116
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,790
can be really bad and security because
it'll make people scared to tell you

117
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,829
about a security incident if they think
they'll be fired or something so then

118
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:37,729
they start covering things up so you
might want to make sure that people

119
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,029
aren't going to be too scared if you're
using negative reinforcement actually

120
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:52,699
report things alright so I stole this
chart which is crooked from Josh mores

121
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:59,868
book on java constants and I just want
to make a note that there is a there is

122
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:04,819
a correlation between the organizational
maturity and how you can change culture

123
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:10,189
so when companies for start the really
small named cowboy style management and

124
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:13,309
that means the people who own it
probably make all the decisions and

125
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:17,179
there if you want to change the culture
you need to change the owners opinion

126
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:22,129
they're the only one who's setting it
then they grow they get this trust based

127
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:25,850
management which is where they delegate
to everyone

128
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:32,360
okay so everyone is a trusted employees
delegated to and in that case you have

129
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,799
to get a consensus of everyone to change
the culture but then because you can't

130
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:41,959
trust everyone when you keep growing you
end up with lightly structured

131
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:45,049
management where you have to put some
rules in place to keep some people from

132
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:50,689
doing stupid things and in that case it
starts getting harder to change the

133
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:54,498
culture if you're not in the right
position in the right position is

134
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:59,660
generally that of the security officer
something like that but you can still do

135
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,189
it they're just takes a little more work
but if you get up to the highly

136
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:09,469
structured companies like the 60,000
employees things with lots of locations

137
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,680
you cannot change the whole culture of
the company

138
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,599
you need to focus on your subgroup and
hope that people will recognize that

139
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,140
your subgroup have made some great
changes and want to bring them to the

140
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,910
rest of the company but pretty much
there's no way to change a heavily

141
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,459
structured company without going outside
your group hierarchy and possibly

142
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,270
getting herself into trouble unless
you're in that good position

143
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:41,660
alright so now I'm going on to my second
story and there are a lot of characters

144
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,770
in this but i'm speeding this one up so
we don't actually need them all there's

145
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:51,170
me bobbin mr. Howard Harriet who's a bad
manager and then we have some other

146
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,439
people are briefly mentioned pinky and
the brain some really clever co-workers

147
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,370
the internal security had hairy friend
from accounting who will kill himself

148
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:04,459
probably because he has no clue what
he's doing the auditors angleton is a

149
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,739
smart higher up and Andy again

150
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:12,680
this one's called persistence in the
wake of oblivion and this story starts

151
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:21,739
with me going to a year-end review and
with Harriet who is no longer my manager

152
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,900
so is more formality

153
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,160
so we're just trying to be nice to each
other and she's like so Bob tell me what

154
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,939
you're doing now and I talked for a
minute like so Harriet what are you

155
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,690
doing

156
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,440
and she's like well there's this one
cool project were working on its really

157
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,930
great from accounting came up with it

158
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,890
Oh what what's that what we found out a
great way to get all those pesky

159
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,970
problems we get with the cut Pete
customers calling for password resets

160
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,080
how are you gonna get rid of that when
you're the passwords

161
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,829
oh really what are you gonna do um well
we're just gonna get rid of them all

162
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:00,890
together we're going to have them log in
with their first name last name

163
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:09,290
birthdate zipcard um did you think about
we might have to customers with the same

164
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,370
name

165
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,370
citgo birthdate oh we looked it up we
don't

166
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,370
well you know there could be a security
risk

167
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,500
oh no no it's fine it's fine as I said
Harriet was a bad manager

168
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,089
so I'm not the diapers and you can argue
with and this wasn't my project it was a

169
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:34,980
good idea to not push the point there
but if she wasn't good manager the type

170
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,480
person who's reasonable you would push
here with but instead I just got some

171
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,239
information and asked her who was
working on it and it was pinky and

172
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:50,160
decided that I needed to do something
else now in a difficult situation i use

173
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,019
a pre-mortem which is is to help me
focus on the best steps and what to do

174
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,519
and the questions I asked here are
what's the best-case scenario

175
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,160
what's the worst-case one of my feeling
and what steps should I take and I ask

176
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,299
what am I feeling because i'm really
upset or annoyed i might do something

177
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:12,299
really stupid that could get me into
some serious trouble

178
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:19,350
obviously so in this case the best cases
that the business pulls the idea and the

179
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:26,549
worst cases that they don't pull it and
I'm feeling annoyed and i decided to try

180
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:29,459
to talk to pinky the person is actually
on the projects that he can take care

181
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:35,069
now i have to speed up this story a lot
so we're going to skip over a gigantic

182
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:38,669
rigmarole but I talked to pinky and then
I end up having to talk to the interims

183
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:43,169
security person and then we go back to
pinky again and we get no response from

184
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:48,779
internal audit because they're slow and
we eventually elevated up to a manager

185
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,129
and then business finds out that we're
telling them they should do and get

186
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:58,860
really upset and so we end up making
some more decisions and we decided to

187
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:05,160
elevate all the way up to angle ten
businesses upset whatever you with us

188
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:12,329
for trying to pull the awesome idea so
we elevated up to angleton who from my

189
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:16,079
students at the beginning was like a
really powerful higher up at the company

190
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,008
and probably the highest that person I
felt comfortable talking to and he took

191
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,480
care of it

192
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,679
he's our problem and we had to wait
patiently a little bit but they got rid

193
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,839
of it so it was that about elevating
carefully through the hierarchy of the

194
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,989
people and as I said again you don't
want to do this if you're actually

195
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:35,830
dealing with a reasonable person

196
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,830
the Harriet from the original story was
totally unreasonable

197
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,910
so a quick post mortem the best thing
was that we got rid of the password list

198
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,290
requirement and the worst thing with the
link the time so what we needed to

199
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,819
improve as a better communication this
case and we could have possibly kept the

200
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,320
business from being upset and also speed
up the response time and as far as what

201
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,490
I could have done differently

202
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,850
the auditor who we needed to get on our
side was well-known for hating long

203
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:09,370
emails so we should never have sent her
one so we need to keep it short and

204
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:14,409
snappy and pick up the phone you know
call and just tell them that we want to

205
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:19,089
discuss something would have probably
helped now story three is raising

206
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:24,970
security awareness and developers and on
this one we had a need for training that

207
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,790
i found out i was looking at stone are
keep doing some static analysis and I

208
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,840
just saw this comment going through some
stuff attempt to load their username and

209
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,379
password from cookies the values are
encrypted using strong cryptography for

210
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,340
enhanced security

211
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,409
sounds good and whatever is going on the
code is hidden because it goes down into

212
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,740
another class you can see what they're
actually doing here so I dig down to the

213
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:50,830
class i see this one this class uses
strong cryptography enhance security and

214
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:58,780
want to guess what algorithm they're
actually using they said is over here

215
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:07,389
somebody said something wet and it
wasn't quite faced 64 but they are

216
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:17,320
actually using single des yes the stuff
that was broken in 1998 I believe um and

217
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,300
this besides reporting this is a bug
that we need to fix immediately not be

218
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,430
using single des i also was like okay we
have some people really confused on what

219
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,900
security means here we need to put some
training into place and they said no

220
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,960
they didn't think we had the time or the
money to spend on training so i did

221
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,850
another little pre-mortem here and the
best-case scenario was to get them to

222
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,629
train their developers and the worst
case was somebody was still going to

223
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,220
think des was strong crypto

224
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:55,640
groupie and was like feeling I was
actually very ready for action here and

225
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,750
so i actually created some training on
my own at home and I got a group of

226
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,900
people to do it at lunch and then i also
got metrics to show the efficacy of the

227
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,940
training so note on metrics you have two
types learning and results Metrix

228
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,179
learning metrics are what you get

229
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:19,970
like when you're actually doing the
learning activities and you can tell you

230
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,260
like a survey before and a survey after
and measure the change in behavior or do

231
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,950
a knowledge test to show that they
learned something was the results made

232
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,630
based metrics need a baseline so in this
case a good baseline as I said we're

233
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:39,710
looking at sooner q4 static analysis was
to use like the Sun r cube the errors

234
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:44,720
that i picked up in the code on security
as a baseline or if you're doing

235
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,200
something else that might be how many
people clicked a phishing email but then

236
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:56,600
you didn't keep measuring those metrics
overtime and Sally change so i did my

237
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,549
securecode lunching learns I developed
the first my damn vulnerable /

238
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:07,668
apparently cute cat app and i gave them
secure code surveys that looked about

239
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:12,679
like this for before and after and i use
this specific example because of the

240
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,220
comment on the second question the to
your knowledge of your record anything

241
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:23,510
its cure if I did I wasn't aware which
was sort of that they didn't quite grasp

242
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:32,299
the point of the question but so my
securecode lunch and learns i had there

243
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:35,929
were not as much changes you would think
but on the scale of one to five how

244
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:41,690
knowledgeable are you went from 2.25
22.7 average your knowledge have you

245
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,270
ever cut something insecure went from
fifty percent to eighty percent on 1525

246
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:53,418
how important is it to consider security
we had 4.25 and 44 after and i consider

247
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,929
security when cutting about weapons in
the time 1666 percent

248
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,080
and the two questions I only asked on
the last one where will I be able to use

249
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,980
the information in the class i got a
century and I've already used the

250
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:13,780
information twenty percent true so this
is a small group we had only like seven

251
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:21,610
to four people depending on what day it
was all done over seven lunches so and

252
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,419
then I took these results and I tried to
get them to do a real training for all

253
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:33,160
the developers and megan said no but it
didn't end here because enter the pci

254
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,560
auditors who I volunteered to deal with
and I actually got them to suggest that

255
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:47,350
I teaches secure coding to the
developers and then we did it and that i

256
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:52,929
did using another great a boat heads
using spring MVC and java the damn

257
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,160
vulnerable zoo baby at which is also my
github even want to look at sort of cute

258
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,570
but it's very easy so probably not a
challenge because really just to show

259
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:08,050
vulnerability for people who aren't
familiar too but yeah so and actually

260
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,220
after going through all this with the
pci auditors I even got the security

261
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,250
officer to want me to help with
corporate fishing programs and other

262
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:23,920
security awareness campaigns so some
conclusions here that you should always

263
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,960
consider the company management style
and size before trying to change things

264
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,410
and try to stay within where you are in
the group hierarchy to not get yourself

265
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:38,380
in trouble but do elevate if you need to
i strongly suggest using post-mortems to

266
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,490
analyze what went wrong when you fail
and try using the pre-mortem if you're

267
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:48,340
confused as what's doing the middle and
yeah even though it didn't work exactly

268
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:53,080
in my case I still say when you cannot
get permission to run the program try

269
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,800
running the voluntary program in your
free time even if you do cannot get

270
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,740
everyone to go you might still get
enough people to change their opinion

271
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,880
people will come to the voluntary
program will change what they're doing

272
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,840
and it can influence others even if you
can't get the company

273
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,629
alcohol is a hole on board and yes do
you use external auditors to your

274
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,919
advantage no one wants to deal with the
auditors I found out and it may be

275
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:27,150
easier than you think to get into those
meetings some resources building

276
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,770
security culture is a great book
strongly recommend it and there's the

277
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:37,559
security culture framework which has
some great articles online i like Bill

278
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,830
gardeners and Valerie Thomas his book
building an information security

279
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,730
awareness program and Chris had energy
and the Shelf interest fishing dark

280
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,370
waters has a lot of things you can
extrapolate it's all focused on

281
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:51,178
corporate fishing but you can a lot of
times extrapolate that to other sorts of

282
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:57,029
security programs and culture and i just
listed jabra more Josh mores book

283

all I have

284
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:11,220

there's questions information in the

285
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,659
last slide the first one is on the first
you go back

286

back isn't it yes I sorry about that it

287
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,260
should maybe just exited out and we
started it

288
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:49,110
that would be easier right

289
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:55,500
its power . when you exit and escape and
then hit f5 will start at the first life

290
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,049
