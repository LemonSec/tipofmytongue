oh I've been around the block in terms
of Technology and I've been around the

28
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,760
block in terms of business and we're
here to see and show you why they're

29
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,649
actually very similar and very different
and how there's a problem in both that

30
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,380
needs to be addressed by both groups
acting together

31
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,150
ok and you occasionally I sleep my
conferences in two weeks so if anybody's

34
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,370

lobby where three of us on the same

35
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,280
conference call for the same conference

39
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,610
shape or form

40
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:27,220
I've been all over the industry from
federal to civilian from dark holes in

41
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,220
the government to light holes that are
just like why are you here so I've done

42
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,970
multiple b-sides I magoon at def con
alguna shmoo come see us there or color

43
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,220
has a table shameless plug

44
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,829
did you see there we go i have i'm
really known for one heck of a work

45
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,670
ethic you know its head down laser and
on your subject until you figure it out

46
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,340
so let's let's move on a little bit
let's let's discuss stuff that were not

47
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,019
addressing in this presentation anything
technical relating the cats

48
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,450
no no virus scans nothing dealing with
that ok

49
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:14,859
nothing with Krebs and definitely
nothing with this guy right so uh

50
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,870
business for technologists

51
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,250
so Scott and I sat down and wrote out a
talk and we're like let's do this death

52
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,669
man this is actually cool nobody does
biz dev right i mean some do it is rare

53
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,000
and they said you know that actually is
sort of a sequence of talks and I've

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,990
been doing a lecture series about the
technology is worth five percent let's

55
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,650
do a full complete series of talks so we
wrote out all six talks and we're giving

56
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:42,739
them at various conferences this one is
business development which is the fourth

57
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,290
in the series of talks they're not going
to be given an order

58
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,860
ok we're going to give them all over the
country we've already submitted cfps for

59
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,600
the next two conferences shmoocon was
submitted to cfp and infosec World in

60
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,039
Orlando will submit to cfa for to see if
we can get more of these but the talks

61
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,870
are basically business for technologists
everybody here more than likely has been

62
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,310
a technologist for most of their working
life they've hacked firewalls or build

63
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,850
firewalls they've done pen testing or
they've done blue team and try to keep

64
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,940
those damn pen testers out but what do
you know about business

65
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,590
I mean what do you know about what it
takes to start run operate the support

66
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,489
mix sales for and then eventually maybe
sell your business and that's a question

67
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,990
that we don't think people are
sufficiently answering for our community

68
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,690
and this lecture series is how do you
start it

69
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,289
how do you get an idea technologies with
five percent how do you build a product

70
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:37,430
how do you operate that business and
actually sell things and make money off

71
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,830
of it an amazing concept making money is
how you pay your rent . the business

72
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,669
development to increase your sales and
and and basically get you get your

73
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,620
business going into the stratosphere

74
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,500
how do you manage your sales when you're
big enough to have a sales team how do

75
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,099
you manage it and then how do you sell
the thing and make the real money into

76
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:59,690
that Island retirement thing so that's
the v40 talks business for technologists

77
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,729
so real

78
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:05,240
let's talk about some securities
business airy the statistics that you're

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,190
seeing up on the slider back from
2014-2015 right so this year hasn't

80
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:16,789
finished yet so we can't really do 2015
2016 just yet so at that time there are

81
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:21,740
a hundred and sixty nine million records
that were released via all the breaches

82
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,630
that happen right there is a staggering
at number of two

83
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,210
200 days before an event is accurately
detected

84
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,890
who knows who knows about the target
hack right well what product that they

85
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,969
have right and I don't want to take
product names up here but what I do want

86
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,660
to say is that attack was lost in the
wind

87
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,750
ok there's too much noise going on with
that product for a sensible person like

88
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,040
any of us in this room to be able to
understand hey we really have a problem

89
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,620
here we really need to look at it

90
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,650
alright so just as a little bit of
background for why we're really in the

91
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,370
business step wherein and why we think
that there's a business here to build

92
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,570
yeah why we think that you know the idea
is look we have negative unemployment

93
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:19,590
right everyone here can have a job in
not that long time but if it's so good

94
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,409
for unemployment for employment rather
for job security

95
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,840
why don't I just you know why don't i
just cut out the middleman and build a

96
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,210
business make all the money not just a
puny salary they pay me well there's

97
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,640
reasons so there's opportunity but
you've got to overcome the reasons that

98
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:43,349
building businesses that make sense to
everybody so let's go over our agenda

99
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:49,140
for today's talk okay we have some
introductions and definitions we have

100
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,950
nightmares of biz dev what you're going
to find what you're gonna really wish

101
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:59,969
didn't crawl up under your bed yeah the
how-to and the facts of this dough i get

102
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,630
into that and agree to this one didn't
agree to that you suz yes you did

103
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:12,090
hey don't back it up thank you at and
then why I really matters and how good

104
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,500
in me

105
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,030
alright so first thing is you're gonna
start a business

106
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:25,230
what he can sell I'm honest I'm tester
great you're gonna go sell tests

107
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:30,000
that's fine but what if you want to sell
I don't know some little box that does

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,620
some specific thing like an on a box or
a dope scope or you know whatever and

109
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,710
travel router hora a raspberry pi based
logging mechanism that uses and curses

110
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:47,190
and engine x240 trust model whatever
that however is well anyway there are

111
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,510
products now product there's a method to
my madness bear with me a product is

112
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,589
something that you have manufactured you
rubber stamp out it makes you money

113
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:01,140
while you sleep okay you sell this it is
gone now i can sell support i can sell

114
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,430
upgrades i can sell whatever but the
product itself like shrink wrap software

115
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,420
it's in here is your Microsoft Office
you use it i don't have to deal with you

116
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,030
anymore if you have problems with it we
can talk and that's that

117
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,650
sorry we backed it up with that then
there's tools tools are something that

118
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:26,010
is a product but only a trained person
can use so if if optiv or some some

119
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,600
consultancy shop has a product that they
use and they won't sell to you they use

120
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,560
it and they charge you for the use of it
that's a tool so a tool is a product

121
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,579
that consultancy or professional
services shop uses in the support of

122
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,260
their client services does that make
sense to everybody and it's a subtle

123
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,400
difference but it's important and then
there's a poor services when you're

124
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,610
gonna sell that service that support for
that product that you sold that's a

125
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,850
service when you're going to sell a pen
test that's a service

126
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:00,360
ok now in the course of that pen test if
you use a I don't know if you use nexus

127
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,589
okay you're using a product in the
support of a service that makes it a

128
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:05,430
tool

129
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,329
okay why does this matter because the
way you sell things the way you price

130
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,200
things the way you write contracts the
way to deal with your clients all

131
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,260
changes depending on whether it's a
product or service or tool

132
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,990
okay you're like really no seriously if
you're selling a service you can sell a

133
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,410
service that actually goes on recurring
likes a service

134
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,939
ok you software-as-a-service i'm not
selling microsoft office here here's

135
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,170
your microsoft office

136
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,469
I'm done go away ok I'm saying

137
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,740
here here's your microsoft office 365
you're gonna pay me for it for every

138
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,740
month for the rest of your life doesn't
feel good

139
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,280
that's now a service and they make more
money off of you because of recurring

140
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,300
billing recurring billing we like
recurring billing so that's products

141
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,800
services and tools

142
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,920
okay that makes sense everybody sorry
that's that's a weird one

143
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,300
just the start of the weird stuff though
right let's get really into weird stuff

144
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,620
right

145
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:04,440
there's a lot of metrics that you should
be tracking once you have your business

146
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,150
development your business

147
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:12,750
once you have established right so
everybody says hey . i can do stuff once

148
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,770
people

149
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,860
Amy will you have to go out and have to
get them and that is what's known as

150
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,670
building your pipeline right I wine

151
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,790
no don't no no no no okay

152
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,530
ah so that's no no wait I how many jokes
i had to delete from this presentation

153
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:35,100
okay seriously swear to god it was are
so some of the metrics that are here are

154
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,140
like your outreach your sales targeting
your leads generated per month your

155
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,410
leads four months versus your leads
working leads workforces your leads

156
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:50,130
connected an estimated pipeline value
right so how much of what with what

157
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,970
business it is capable to what product
or service of your business

158
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,410
where's the match out and how do you
find the synergy between the two

159
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,130
businesses to come together for a
contractor for work or for any products

160
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,380
or services right and then from there we
go into how do you convert everything

161
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,560
over so once you have a lead how are you
converting your lead what's your rate

162
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,410
would be $PERCENT conversion rate right
and then let's get to close the sale now

163
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,990
let's be honest though this is not this
tall

164
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,010
this is the next business development is
what you do the village of business

165
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,180
sales management is how you grow that
business that built this is just

166
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,579
literally a teaser a taste for the next
doll

167
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,260
yeah and there's a huge difference huge
huge unmistakeably huge difference

168
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,140
between sales and BD business
development right business development

169
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,980
rbd sales manager sm totally different
things

170
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,470
hey don't go there oh they're real

171
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:55,500
we're in public we were giggling like
children who we were gonna have okay so

172
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,890
you're like what I've got friends I mean
at least two right sorry I couldn't

173
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,520
resist

174
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,280
I but your network even if it's a good
network is limited you have a certain

175
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,000
amount of friends you know certain my
colleagues you certain of contacts some

176
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,670
of them will hand your business because
they know and trust you

177
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:20,339
those of you who are trustworthy some of
them will can become can be confused or

178
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,690
persuaded to and your business joking
about using part but realistically you

179
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,140
still have a finite number of people
that you know that you're linked into

180
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,920
that your facebook with whatever okay
and that have business to give you and

181
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,189
then a budget to fund that business that
that that that things you can do for

182
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:42,030
them and are in the right part of the
budget cycle . that ok so I'll just

183
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,900
build the best mousetrap going back for
an old saying and they'll they'll show

184
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,090
up and don't want my business

185
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:55,380
no not really is your name is Elon Musk
because if not no okay so not everybody

186
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,030
you know wants to buy what you're
offering

187
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,329
well that's what I talked about do they
need what you're trying to sell they

188
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,660
have the budget for the right . a budget
cycle they have the go from their

189
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,550
management etc etc

190
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,530
look you gotta get out there and find
new customers because once you have a

191
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,930
process for getting new customers

192
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,930
you'll keep getting new customers ok
because again you can have 5,000 friends

193
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:24,510
because you're the most gregarious organ
in the world but when you get 4999

194
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,100
that's given your business probably
close to done somebody okay so it's not

195
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:36,090
just your customers it's also new
products users usually get so all these

196
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:45,690
all these going to your little one your
business how do you move your business

197
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,790
for eating every single person has a
mortgage that works

198
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,230
it's not so much that you look at have
got a mouth

199
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:00,200
hey I have another mortgage responsible
so I've got to tell you this story and

200
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,490
it's relevant I promise

201
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:06,350
so I'm one time somebody went to me and
goes I'd started to start which is

202
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,990
subsequently closed by the way and I'm
actually proud of that I did the right

203
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,920
thing but i had started to start up and
I was a CEO of that startup somebody

204
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,819
walked up to me very very next person to

205
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,290
years I want to be CEO just like you
were making millions of dollars anyone

206
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,270

do that too and she's what do you mean

207
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,939
your CEO you must make lots of money and
I want

208
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,150
can you give me an example of a CEO
infosec that's making lots of money goes

209
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,560

fantastic example so let's use him as

210
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,369
our example are right she goes okay I
said let's explain how you do that to

multi-billion dollar business because he

213
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,580
was at diebold if you didn't know that
he was there see so I said number to

214
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,790

tenure they're building the contacts and

215
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,530
the contracts hit contract sign for your
left okay at least verbal contracts if

216
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,520
you wanted to do them disagreements but
whatever he had contracts before he ever

217
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,780
left diebold expect the last two or
three years doing it so be the CEO of a

218
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,930
multibillion-dollar company b have to
spend the last three years your time

219
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,260

220
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,930

hired already have already know and with

223
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,510

somebody else is paying you a salary

224
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,830
hey that's a great way to start I said

multibillion-dollar corporation and she

honest picture

227
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,870
yeah so we want to be clear we're
assuming you're not the CEO of a

228
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,100
multibillion-dollar corporation that's

perils pitfalls and wonderful wonderful

230
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,319

thanks so how do we hope is value your
so let's let's get dangerous for a

232
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:18,959
minute let's talk about the Real
American Horror Story stuff getting paid

233
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,959
good luck money upfront as wonderful as
a small company it's kind of tough to

234
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,149
say hey I've never done this before

235
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:31,949
pay me now and i'll do the work
afterwards they're like yeah sure okay

236
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:37,950
you gotta understand what acceptance
criteria and milestones are you got to

237
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,580
get well you can get half up front and
do you pay your mechanic half up front

238
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,928
you pay your plumber half up front
because I tell you right now and I'm

239
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:47,100
being very honest with you

240
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,539
infosec is being commoditized infosec is
specialized already we know that how

241
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,929
many people here would say i am an
infosec practitioner meaning that they

242
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:57,330
do everything ok

243
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,668
one guy one guy in the back is
everything you do forensics you depend

244
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:14,519
testing phone scanning threat
intelligence fantastic do you do it as

245
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:20,100
well as somebody that specializes in all
right so and I respect that

246
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,850
well said an honest so we we've got an
industry that is specializing and

247
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,779
commoditizing it is starting to become a
value-based system for example has

248
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:31,710
anybody heard of a pen test sweatshop
did you know you can depend test on for

249
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,830
eight dollars per IP no joke

250
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,189
okay so everybody that goes well and
testers will always make three dollars

251
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:46,799
an hour we'll see i'm betting against
that respectively if you're in a value

252
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,500
based economy you've got to be very
careful about trying to get paid to make

253
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,100
sure you get paid you want to make sure
you get paid at least some front but you

254
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,789
gotta build a reputation to get paid up
front you gotta build a building the

255
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:59,850
reputation of cards you get jobs done to
get jobs and you get money to get money

256
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,850
to get paid up front it's an amazing
concept it's really really chicken egg

257
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,258
ok so and its really depending on the
terms and conditions right them

258
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:10,799
carefully or have your lawyer do it oh
wait that's expensive crap it's all

calling pieces

284
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:17,130
no no it's not you're here that's kind
of a differentiator so realistically is

285
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,309
when you get that pipeline moving or you
think that you have something valuable

286
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:23,668
something tangible that you can then
move towards a statement of work and

287
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,400
years MSA is all that crap we just
talked about

288
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:35,310
you have to find people to get to do the
work right so a we hope that you have a

289
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:40,409
good enough contact list where you could
say you want to come to work for me you

290
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,940
would wear my shirt

291
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,940
ok I have to give you one doing

292
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,290
yes ok so that's pretty much how it
works and then you guys come together

293
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:54,540
figure out a great sign everything in
paperwork make sure it's set in stone or

294
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,580
the agreement of the salad statement of
work get an NDA from them

295
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,840
yeah cover your sets you have to
basically make sure that you're an

296
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,290
employer at this point and you're
covering your liability and your clients

297
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,450
liabilities by doing this stuff

298
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:13,830
oh my god cannot shake somebody's hand
absolutely but you know what contract is

299
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,659
everybody this is not a joke

300
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:26,730
does anybody have put definition of a
contract wrong absolutely correct

301
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:33,360
absolutely wrong you're a contract is an
understanding but excited because begun

302
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,580
ok you're right people because you're
going for the legal definition requires

303
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,600
consideration the realistic definition
of a contract is an understanding of the

304
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,689
rights and responsibilities between the
contracting parties so there's no

305
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,640
confusion later if I say you're going to
be doing the phone scan your gonna be

306
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,450
doing the pen test of these IPS you're
gonna be doing the pen test of those IDs

307
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:59,190
and I have it written down and I say for
that I'm gonna pay you whatever some

308
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,770
some amount of money x y&z mountain its
twenty ok that unit whatever and he goes

309
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,320
well I did his eye peas because he
wasn't doing so I get all the money

310
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,169
right now because wait a minute i was
about to start

311
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,460
what the heck it there that's confusion
we don't need the confusion so we write

312
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,270
things down so you understand because
it's a lot easier to ask dumb questions

313
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,889
or rather silly questions up front and
write it down then have tried to do it

314
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,350
on the backend and go to court

315
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:32,100
ok mystically realistically to take care
of you doing what that's more man that

316
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,590
understood

317
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:36,220
and the bigger picture and a small
company that you know you know I mean

318
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,179
often off more often than not we find
ourselves sitting back with your

319
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:45,429
co-workers that are Boston's saying I'm
smarter than that guy is job

320
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:48,429
yeah but how what parts of their job do
not know about that's it exactly

321
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,630
and there's always something in the
background going on there

322
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:56,409
they're doing with which makes them
special you're dealing with which makes

323
00:23:56,409 --> 00:24:00,220
you special stains swimming so let's
let's talk about this for one second i

324
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,289
want to expand this like let's assume
that you have a friend I know it's a

325
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:08,710
stretch there with and I'm sorry I
couldn't resist

326
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,870
I'm sorry Jackie will be his friend ok
so you have a friend who says I've got a

327
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,939
pen test for you i'm willing to pay

328
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,809
I don't know $50,000 expenses let's say
it's a decent-sized pentest ok you go oh

329
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:24,158
that's awesome you go look I'm the next
three months i'm booked up solid so

330
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,399
you're gonna call him he's going to the
pen testing hey did I want you to the

331
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,840
pen test i'll give you you know a
hundred bucks now or maximum of whatever

332
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,889
it is 50 hours

333
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,640
ok five grand all right now you're
looking to make forty five thousand

334
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,750
dollars on that right and he's like wait
why are you making 45 thousand dollars

335
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,640
and something i'm doing the work on

336
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,630
well that's true but what he doesn't
realize that even error omission

337
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,480
insurance you got business liability
insurance

338
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,299
you're the one that develop the
relationship blah blah blah blah blah

339
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:56,620
this lot of reasons that but in the end
that really is a bit too much of a gap

340
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,639
you're stepping on that way too high so
my point is is that for everything you

341
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,590
go wait why are they making all that
money

342
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,730
ok well there's reasons they may not be
good reasons they may be crappy reasons

343
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,870
with his reasons

344
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,809
also there's the fact that sometimes
you're going through multiple layers

345
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:15,250
that fifty-thousand-dollar pentest may
be done by somebody doesn't 45 grams and

346
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,880
every person in that chain may only make
five thousand dollars millions of your

347
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,610
bare with me may only make five thousand
dollars in profit

348
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:27,459
it may have gone through 17 different
layers literally in our business that

349
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,640
happens sometimes a bit much probably
325 happens all the time you're like wow

350
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,070
seriously but no comment

351
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:48,350
so so the converse of that might be you
come across somebody says hey I got a I

352
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:55,879
got engaged in 2004 you bring it to him
and say I can't do this but I'm gonna

353
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,390
hand it's you I want to find this feat
right and he says great points at twenty

354
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,800
percent is actually standard finders yet
and that's fine and then the liabilities

355
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,180
on him you're just getting cash

356
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,710
yeah psst insurance its own this is all
the work to make money this and complex

357
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,510
stuff but anyway we're talking about
business stuff

358
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,510
yeah so this is the other big part of
this is communication

359
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,700
who here is ever had a conversation with
your significant other when they realize

360
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,700
that neither of you were speaking the
same argument

361
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,200
ok that's going is it different you
should be raising your hand yeah

362
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:37,130
especially with my wife is raising her
hand back huh that's known as a

363
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,330
disconnect or rupture and and my
favorite story about this is a guy that

364
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,560
married a lovely woman and he got sick
and neither of them in their courtship

365
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,520
had ever gotten sick before in his
family when you got sick you went to bed

366
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,730
and somebody came with large glasses of
orange juice and tea and toast and and

367
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,650
took care of you okay in her family when
you got sick they left you alone because

368
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,830
they didn't want to get sick they
figured let it die out you know the the

369
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,060
disease the cold the flu whatever let it
stop with that person so you would creep

370
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,570
in the middle of the night and get food
back to bed and be miserable but when

371
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,100
you're done in your week of misery

372
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,520
nobody else has got sick ok and her
family juice with something to drink a

373
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,320
little tiny glasses on sunday as part of
the ceremony or whatever so he got sick

374
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,280
he retires to his bedroom loudly
announces i'm sick and expects tea and

375
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,399
toast and orange juice and large glasses
to show up it is you know show up on his

376
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,440
bed honey it's okay you know that that
retain and he like six hours later he's

377
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,610
like wait a minute workers my i'm hungry
because honey can I get a glass of juice

378
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,350
please maybe she doesn't understand and
she brings a little tiny glass of juice

379
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:46,399
is like oh you don't care about me you
love me and they had an argument and you

380
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,550
realized after a little while that their
scripts were not compatible

381
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,090
they had script that they live their
lives by and they in this case of

382
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,990
illness they did not match at all so
they had a disconnect or rupture they

383
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,200
were talking at each other not with each
other and he said okay we need to sit

384
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,560
down and discuss the past and they did
and they came to an understanding

385
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,790
eventually he learned to accept glasses
of juice left his doorstep he never gets

386
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,540
to see his wife was sick but that's cool
it works without you know they can do an

387
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,560
accommodation

388
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,700
the point is is that when you're talking
you're explaining why the network being

389
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,620
flat as a problem and they're going does
it affect my ability to see cat pictures

390
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,790
will know you're talking different
languages 14 the internets traffic on

391
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,450
verified forty percent of the internet
traffic is nothing with cats

392
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,260
did you know that 89% statistics are
made up of Abraham Lincoln said that

393
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:44,420
with so when you do a presentation a
talk a meeting with a business partner

394
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,890
or potential business partner or
prospect or customer that we want you

395
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,670
have to understand how they communicate
i did a workshop with besides Detroit

396
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,810
showed up for a 50-minute talked and had
a four hour workshop do it was

397
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:02,210
interesting but I split the room into
compliance security and executives and I

398
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,810
said okay you compliance people here's
your list of problems security people

399
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,620
here is your list of problems executives
you have one problem you have to take

400
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,790
and solve the problems that they want to
do that they have with the solutions

401
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,879
that they want to do but if you go over
budget you get fired what's our budget

402
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,080
not telling you

403
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:25,580
okay you better balance pretty carefully
by the time the security people got done

404
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,550
explaining what a flat network was that
was a real example by the way and that

405
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,180
was a real line but does it affect my
ability to see my cat pictures i thought

406
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,140
the guy's head was going to explode ok
it was hilarious doesn't affect our

407
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,160
ability to do business

408
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,820
no well then why do we care and it's
like wow they really don't speak the

409
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,360
same languages we had participants
taking notes like worry about cat

410
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,240
pictures like it was great

411
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,260
if you don't speak a language their
audience your prospect or client or

412
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:56,809
customer can understand you are not
going to make a sale check

413
00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:01,970
it goes it goes further than just
English goes further than just passed or

414
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:07,669
RC or if you're from Djibouti goes
further than that it's a deeper level of

415
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:12,710
communication really is quintessential
quote-unquote sorry Carl Erskine model

416
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:19,909
speak if you can understand where
they're coming from and you can resonate

417
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:25,970
with that you can communicate with a
prospect if you cannot you will not if

418
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:31,070
you use jargon they will not listen
their eyes will glaze over if you can

419
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,320
explain why they should care

420
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,519
look I I'm in sort of the
entrepreneurial world in the DC area

421
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,539
especially okay and I get people coming
to me saying I've got this great product

422
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,860
would you listen to me

423
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,508
sure I'm a great practice pitcher ok you
know it's your thing to me let's talk

424
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:53,539
let me listen and ninety-nine point nine
percent of the time I have to stop them

425
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:56,570
three-quarters of the way through all
the way through whatever go hey you

426
00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:01,309
didn't answer the question like what
question I go the subtle what why do I

427
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:02,960
care

428
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,919
it will don't you understand there's a
problem like no you never pose one that

429
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:07,940
I have

430
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,840
well you know if you're a big executive
you understand that I'm like no they

431
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,590
won't because I'm I'm putting myself in
the mindset of a big executives I

432
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,580
practiced when I was a model 37 I work
with a lot of executives from a large

433
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,720
companies to understand how they thought
and believe me it is foreign bloody land

434
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,730
ok they you have to answer the so what
question before you will get anywhere

435
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:33,289
and that's communication and I've
labored this I'm sorry but hey and by

436
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:36,710
the way what you're wearing counts
wearing the shmoocon t-shirt to the

437
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,879
present the presentation it might get
you . to third book on attending or if

438
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:44,119
they know what's going on is if not you
just showed up in a graffiti shirt to a

439
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,168
serious business meeting

440
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,460
we have a problem here it also depends
on knowing your audience to that so if

441
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:56,690
your audience expects you to show up in
teachers and your hair is blue blue ma

442
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:03,740
trust me there are asked him to take his
hat off

443
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,620
oh wow we watched it out finally get a
blue mohawk a DEFCON

444
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:16,429
so there are people out there that think
that we as the hacker community should

445
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,140
look a certain way issues

446
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,850
well why did a certain way right

447
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:27,679
she was just good time sorry three
should function like that guy that we

448
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,770
said we're not going to talk about even
though there are people that are like

449
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,250
that that is not all of us

450
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:40,160
yes a lot of us have beards yes a lot of
us are you know some of us are

451
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,980
overweight although i'm working very
hard and if you missed the president

452
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:49,370
talked on obesity in infosec you should
definitely watch the recording but look

453
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,570
real communication is there's a problem
here is the problem here is a solution

454
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,689
do you want to implement the solution
house on fire get out of the house

455
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,970
it's october sprinkle the servers with
antivirus change that's his line minus

456
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:08,179
where we saw record of the company that
brought in some mystic to throw holy

457
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:13,970
water on the servers in the server room
to the ward off viruses I'm not kidding

458
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:19,340
this is not me up you were serious about
that i % series I thought he was joking

459
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:26,059
ok this is not made up you cannot make
this interesting it's bad thing did you

460
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:32,629
use like non conductive fluid you know
so did all right so look the way we want

461
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,630
to communicate this reason there's a
problem here is the pain . here's the

462
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,380
problem

463
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,830
here's the solution you can also use
sports has anybody heard of rubber hose

464
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,960
description you know if you previously i
should have put the xkcd on here the

465
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,800
xkcd goes oh my God we're going to do is
his laptops encrypted with a

466
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,309
million-dollar cluster to crack the
encryption the real world here's a five

467
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:54,200
dollar rental beat the key item

468
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,510
ok and and so we don't want to use force
especially for clients they have this

469
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,750
thing called procurement Department will
pay us if we do that and the police will

470
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,809
be upset with us we want to use reason
but we need to use reason that they will

471
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:06,889
understand

472
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:13,730
yeah and no matter what every
conversation you have to help finish the

473
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,949
previous slide it's okay don't worry
about door so you had to help help us

474
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:19,549
out

475
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,560
ABC it's at the bottom it's very easy to
understand any conversation that you

476
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,270
have always should be closing
conversation which means you always take

477
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,040
an action romantic conversation you have
right right it's just like this so we

478
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,320
figure out what works and what doesn't

479
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,359
next time we do something like this we
know our action items to move forward or

480
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,399
you go into a pen test well you know I
really didn't go that deep on port 80

481
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,469
which is HTTP on the pen test so next
time you know we take an action and move

482
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:56,509
that forward to the next time I know
what I'm going after right so that

483
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,690
really goes into mistakes that's
actually really good partly I didn't

484
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,460
never thought of that

485
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,720
so goes on the mistakes lesson learned
right so what kind of mistakes remember

486
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,200
that magical thing we were talking about
the beginning called statement of work

487
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:17,419
but it's been i'm going to trade my
services x4 dollar amount while I or

488
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:23,810
unit amount or sex or whatever so that
it a lot of people like to say well i'm

489
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,810
paying you a hundred an hour to do this

490
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,670
um can you also do this so if I think
you hundred an hour to sweep the floor

491
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:37,850
by the way you also wash Peggy you also
wax the floor interning with rolling on

492
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,069
the floor as well you prep it for that

493
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,330
that's great ok let's build a rocket
ship on the footwell wait you're saying

494
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,500
we can't do that

495
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,770
let's leave the door open if it's locked
security

496
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,590
let's say that are open if it's locked
on to let people in yes so and that

497
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:58,520
actually has a fixed price job if you're
getting paid a hundred our do whatever

498
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,480
the hell they want

499
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,670
okay well too . be careful like never
mind but if you're doing a fixed-price

500
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,580
job where you're getting a thousand
dollars to do a pen test that get hit by

501
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:14,120
the way would you wax the floors as well
know you're gonna have to pay gonna call

502
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:21,920
or yeah you have to do an sn2 us aww
yeah well somebody works the government

503
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,670
ok

504
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:29,960
who's fed in the back of the room . the
Fed spot the Fed just busting around

505
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,950
he's turning red

506
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:38,600
we can see it up here the federal arm
had been detected been detected so look

507
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,569
there's the scope creep which is like
hey you know you doing the pen test on

508
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,410
these IPS gonna add three of them and
can add three more and three more and

509
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:48,410
three more than the scope grab which is
hey you're doing the pen test on these

510
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:54,410
ten IPS here's a hundred more weights it
we need no you're going to do it or I'm

511
00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:01,100
going to stencil the entire contract and
people will use your statement of work

512
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:07,040
it is a natural human reaction to say
hello and one or $TIME and 2 or by the

513
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,170
way and two million is natural for
people to do this expected at some point

514
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,460
in any contractor working in it's just
like your friends coming up to you say

515
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,070
hey can you give me a ride all the way

their ads a hilarious because a lot of

547

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,910
business gets done and very few hands
went up okay my point is is that you're

565
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:10,720
all intimately connected lots of groups
for technical people and technical stop

566
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,589
and you can if I said hey can you find
somebody that can do adobe air

567
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:20,260
pentesting but maybe I can't but hang on
gimme 10 minutes said that a you know a

568
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:25,330
note on a mailing list to find somebody
right so don't forget though going to

569
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:31,840
events is right for your business there
are some people events really don't do

570
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,230
much for business but there are other
people depending on whether your product

571
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,700
or service where the that will really
celery what you're doing and no matter

572
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:46,029
what a time always try to get to sea
level suite of business development

573
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,140
business

574
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,230
I don't want to be talking to an
engineer why

575
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,180
well it's great he might have a lead up
to the c-suite but you don't know how I

576
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:04,690
spend their be who he knows see what she
has is all and they can't say yes

577
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:11,230
you want money makers decision-makers
you want to be up on high rate so it's

578
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,650
the whole that each of you start high go
low

579
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:20,230
that's her business I think so okay
makes sense to me makes sense you could

580
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:26,830
resist are so I always work with those
people that don't understand what the

581
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:36,759
hell we you because that what we do was
alright clients everybody should know

582
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,870
what a vertical and horizontal give it

583
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:46,670
mindshare mission linked co antrim an
organization some of them and I don't

584
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,270
know if those three you can get in
without being a CEO someone you have to

585
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:54,200
be sponsored into there's a lot of but
look how many hundreds of technical

586
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,810
groups are there from defcon groups love
linux user groups uh bah-bah-bah does

587
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,660
the same thing with entrepreneur
ganization is the same thing with

588
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,080
business organizations as the same thing
with CEO organizations there's a

589
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,710
gazillion of them just a google you have
once killed a lot of people don't know

590
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:14,450
how to use Google to amazing concept and
to become CEO watch the other five

591
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,569
presentations that we're going to be
giving away your on this year right

592
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:24,140
she was ok so is anybody not know what a
vertical or horizontal are in terms of

593
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,370
business

594
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:32,060
don't be shy it's okay i didn't ok a
vertical is a business line so aerospace

595
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,750
is a vertical uh transportation is a
vertical banking is a vertical FinTech

596
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,710
our financials is a vertical those are
the types of businesses horizontal is

597
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,970
the size of a business so horizontal
would be lets say and you can split this

598
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,089
almost any way you want five million
dollars of annual revenue and below

599
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:51,620
5,000 employees to 50,000 employees
whatever this there's different ways to

600
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,109
school to skin that gap that doesn't
make sense

601
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:58,430
ok so that's a vertical and horizontal
see if you go I want to be in aerospace

602
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:04,129
engineering at about the five million
250 million dollar company there's your

603
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,490
profile of clients that you want to be
with you want to attach to any one

604
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,120
attack

605
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,580
you're not going to get there right out
of the gate either know you gotta find

606
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,600
out what your what your specific targets
are you don't even know yet and you have

607
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,920
to grind through it

608
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,230
oh yeah this is not something that
magical unicorns party rainbows flying

609
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,620
through the air looking like pop-tarts
is going to happen

610
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,690
did you just in the end cap the audio i
did ok so that's not going to happen

611
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:40,820
okay you're 20 or 30-year career you may
have three warrants that maybe that is

612
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:47,270
if you're capable to handle them if your
business is that the right size and I so

613
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,390
the Unicorn is a company that's the
right size at the right stage with the

614
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,390
right money

615
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:55,618
eating the right things from you that
gets dropped in your lap there's so many

616
00:44:55,619 --> 00:45:00,299
variables that going away for you no one
not even funny when you really start

617
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:04,980
down this track of what we're talking
about and you understand hey I really

618
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:10,049
could use unicorn right now and no one
shows up great and yourself that

619
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:14,160
realistically with the clients thing
we're talking about targeting the first

620
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,058
two lines of the slide so targeting how
do you target the right client they are

621
00:45:18,059 --> 00:45:20,910
the business of the commercial are the
government are they

622
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,808
foreign government because that's legit
two are they foreign commercial are they

623
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:28,529
you know are they regulatory are the pen
testing of what are you doing for them

624
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:32,220
what they need how much money they have
how much money they making this is all

625
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,459
targeting but then it gets into how do
you find them and we talked about

626
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,029
organizations and associations and
places to go and look for them

627
00:45:39,029 --> 00:45:42,210
ok business groups all right and
sometimes you have to use those

628
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,660
wonderful tools of open source
intelligence ago hey where does the CEO

629
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,038
of this company in the correct vertical
incorrect horizontal where does he go

630
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:54,059
what associations is he a member of what
associate or she what associations are

631
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:57,990
they a member of what where they take
their their free time in their

632
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:01,529
professional development existence and
can I go to the same place and happy to

633
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:05,759

that stalking know it's open source

634
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:07,890
intelligence dammit

635
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:15,779
thank you

636
00:46:15,779 --> 00:46:24,180
we just got rolled by my wife so how do
you get on the calendar same idea you've

637
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,328
got to get some information you've got
to find your people that you want to

638
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:31,259
talk to and you've got to make up and
get to them in a certain way that is

639
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:35,369
appropriate that is presentable that is
proper but that invokes their interest

640
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:36,059
in you

641
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:42,779
okay uh and get referrals last quick
then get referrals talk to your friends

642
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:46,410
talk to your family to talk to you know
look at your Linkedin find the people

643
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,769
that link to the people that you need to
talk to I don't have anything start

644
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:53,129
creating those chains start creating
this change now i'm going to talk about

645
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:56,250
Dave Kennedy and spent the last three
years of his existence at diebold

646
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,980
getting those contacts Kirk together

647
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,279
guess what if you've got a job now start
getting those contacts together while

648
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:03,269
you're still getting paid

649
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:08,729
to not get paid by your own company ok
start making those chains of

650
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:13,319
relationships and referrals happen now
and you're here that first step that's

651
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:14,279
awesome

652
00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:19,019
okay trust me a few years will be saying
our first name and going hi Josh I'm an

653
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:25,678
entrepreneur he got the jokei make those
referrals happen

654
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,299
don't don't sit back and say well i'm
going to stick to my group of friends

655
00:47:30,299 --> 00:47:38,130
kind of penance service are you doing
yourself he number one point of our

656
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:45,749
community these conferences events is
what you get smokey thought it was

657
00:47:45,749 --> 00:47:57,538
drinking liquid courage a lot about my
lemon team good so we're doing contracts

658
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:05,729
really come from the stork yes right
there we go armed

659
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:08,729
how do you know see a ball coming

660
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:18,509
well it smells like Axe like about looks
like how we do you did a dark when done

661
00:48:19,169 --> 00:48:22,979
he's okay look to see that might think
my sink is clogged that's horrible

662
00:48:22,979 --> 00:48:25,319
horrible

663
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,399
okay look sir so arm how long

664
00:48:29,399 --> 00:48:37,499
Alan sales cycle right it can be 10
minutes it can be 36 months government

665
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:41,009
contracting you actually have to support
a salesperson sales engineer for 18 to

666
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:44,880
36 months to get a single contract
that's the average my way

667
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,489
don't hesitate to tell you there's work

668
00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:55,049
don't be great to say your sister needs
to be reworked but really use more

669
00:48:55,049 --> 00:49:00,899
refined language what I really wanted to
say but arm you know what's what is the

670
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:04,259
worst thing that you hear from a client

671
00:49:04,259 --> 00:49:07,709
what is it anybody no hmm

672
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:16,770
that's actually really close we should
talk about this next month we didn't

673
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,119
value

674
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,310
yeah okay we didn't get the audio with
the screaming shape you so look things

675
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,220
that get in your way or called sales
friction things that help you move

676
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,109
things along are reducing sales friction
the faster you can make a sale cycle go

677
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:33,328
the less sales friction you have it

678
00:49:33,329 --> 00:49:38,460
lawyers are bad sales friction okay yeah
and don't be surprised if you have

679
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,780
clients and say well I mean your
proposal sounds all sound right proper

680
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:49,650
i'm going to mix my god give me two more
months I've got this thing in China

681
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,750
going on if you know who you are

682
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,820
I don't need to see anymore so it just
come back to be next month once more

683
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,869
things you know

684
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:01,829
no doubt that's something you don't want
to hear you want to be able to manage

685
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:07,920
your people and your clients to be able
to keep your revenue streams coming in

686
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,380
and it's so you know you don't see this
shit

687
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:18,450
ok real quickly building a business is a
pain in the ass it is building a book of

688
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:22,589
business is actually hardest part of
building a business or at least one of

689
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:27,150
the hardest parts your job the whole
point of this entire talk is do you want

690
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:33,089
to build a book of business go network
you'll make friends go find people to

691
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:36,720
learn from get contracts from get
referrals to people who can get

692
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,310
contracts for you go get people
seriously no joke

693
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:49,410
go get people ok it is not simple it is
not simple it is not simple it sucks

694
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,839
it's not simple it is a grind

695
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:56,430
ok it's hard that's never moved

696
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:01,950
Oh down boy are going to get our 13
contracts and they're gonna have nothing

697
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:05,279
for a year you're gonna get five
contracts and you have nothing for six

698
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:05,880
months

699
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,180
it's feast or famine you're going to
feel like the top of the world

700
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,270
you're gonna feel like you're totally an
idiot for doing anything like it

701
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,900
you're gonna feel amazing like pw you're
gonna feel horrible like jeans

702
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,310
and vice versa ok it's the entrepreneurs
rollercoaster you literally will get

703
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:25,000
immune to feeling good or bad about
things because you're just it goes

704
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,920
through us so often at the end of the
day it is what it is and you eat what

705
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,820
you kill

706
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:37,090
ok you eat everything if you get when
you're working for a business or UC to

707
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:42,760
somebody hey I want to come help you the
norm in our business is twenty percent

708
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,020
of whatever you sell their differences
but there are there are now of course

709
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,770
there are also trade-offs one of the big
things that most people don't get is

710
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:57,160
that everything in a business is a
negotiation whether you're going to new

711
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,049
job or you're in your current job and
you rock that or you're exiting from a

712
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,610
company it doesn't matter

713
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:09,160
everything is a negotiation ok and some
point you gotta say screw it i'm out

714
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,020
like us

715
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:21,970
yeah ladies and gentlemen questions
questions yes happens

716
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:29,230
well how no let me illuminate let me
throw a question back at you

717
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:35,290
how deep is your pocket help the right
that's that's the exact answer it all

718
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:36,279
depends

719
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,020
ok does it make sense for your business
for you step away vertical war we push

720
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:41,950
harder

721
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:45,490
it also have big is that contract if
there are five million dollar contract

722
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:48,879
that you're going to make some 75%
margins on which is amazing

723
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,720
which is you know covered in another
talk right are you gonna is it worth

724
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,770
your time

725
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,350
like I said when you do a government
sales cycle you have to support a

726
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:59,589
salesperson in the sales engineer for 18
to 36 months before they make the first

727
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:00,400
sale

728
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,630
ok so you know sometimes that sale cycle
is monstrous so sometimes you're going

729
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:08,260
to fire a client or prospective client
is just not worth my time anymore but it

730
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,620
depends on the trade-offs how big is
that potential business how long is the

731
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,770
cell cycle getting sometimes you can
write off a year if you do an RFI

732
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,560
request for information or an RFP from
the government

733
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,430
you could spend hundreds of hours
working up a beautiful beautiful piece

734
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:26,049
of work but they'll just be like oh
that's nice honey and trash can and it's

735
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,010
any happens more

736
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:31,750
not surprised by the back we have a
question from our engineer redhead

737
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:45,010
you're in and i like that fat redhead
that's going to be hiring sorry i was

738
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:48,250
just talking to a very very prominent
member of our community about that and

739
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:53,230
the answer is as fast as you can and as
slow as you can as fast as you can

740
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,470
because you want more sales the
salesperson will get you that as slow as

741
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:59,890
you can because when you hire a sales
person they are either going to be a

742
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:05,440
useless pile of crud which cost you
money or they're going to be amazing and

743
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,700
get you so much work that you're gonna
be scrambling to cover oil so it's it's

744
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:13,450
you've got to build what you're selling
you've got to build your company

745
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,660
vegetable processing procedures your
paperwork's and paperwork stuff and then

746
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:19,690
you should probably get a salesperson
getting the right salesperson is really

747
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:20,590
not easy

748
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:29,470
pw how many bad sees sales people have
you dealt with in your career not what I

749
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:33,759
was expecting but I mean salespeople are
flighty lot they'll be like oh I can

750
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,660
sell anything it turns out they can sell
red staplers on thursday at one company

751
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:41,230
they are amazing at that but that's all
they're amazing at and when you do

752
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:46,690
higher sales person you have put in
their ball field for them to see see see

753
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:53,020
a hundred percent commission yet one of
the kinds that you don't look at it as

754
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:56,620
your success you will get in that
setting somebody also personal selves

755
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,970
and I can't stress that not anything
that you do whether it's running a

756
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:08,379
business being an engineer b-level exact
you always set people up vs s okay i

757
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:12,220
will tell you one quick things i had a
friend of mine who's the CEO of a new

758
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,970
company at the time very successful now
well well done for him because he's

759
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:19,029
there every time that a salesperson will
make more than the CEO because that just

760
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,840
doesn't seem right to me and was like
you want the salesperson to make more by

761
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:28,150
13 or 15 times in the CEO why because
then you're making a lot of sales idiot

762
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:34,549
so counterintuitive but you know you'll
know when the time is right

763
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:39,650
higher sales person and they don't know
just organically grow inside the

764
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:43,940
business you know but whatever you do
you always put in their courses seat and

765
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,670
that's where the hundred percent
commission comes in

766
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:50,330
good luck with that really is like
fifteen to twenty percent depends on

767
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,810
what's negotiated remember that thing I
was talking about everything is

768
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:54,799
negotiation

769
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,690
yeah unless you're doing technical work
we got 30 seconds last question by the

770
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:05,330
way best question of the three gets a
wristband for besides delaware sorry

771
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:14,060
oh yeah if you pay if you put your
engineers because they bring your

772
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,340
business you should pay them money

773
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:21,350
yes pay them a commission at least give
them a spife give them new laptop iPad

774
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:24,440
lab something at the very least get
something at least you can write the

775
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,580
damn thing off

776
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,060
oh my God if you can write off a piece
of equipment handed out like candy

777
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:32,450
ok so another talk yeah we'll talk about
that later

778
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:40,490
that's actually it you get the behavior
incentivize anything new metric will

779
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:45,799
improve this is a warning if you have a
call center and you incentivize or or

780
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,950
metric called closing felt close calls
like crazy

781
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:54,259
the problems will not be solved but the
calls will be closed so what you do you

782
00:56:54,260 --> 00:57:05,420
get what you intend device was that yes
this is mrs. its or go we have to go far

783
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,740
go

784
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,890
speaking of going far ladies and
gentlemen thank you

785
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,520
Oh
