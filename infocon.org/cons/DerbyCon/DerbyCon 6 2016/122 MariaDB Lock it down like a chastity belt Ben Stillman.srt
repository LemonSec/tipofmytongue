1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,759
I well sunday afternoon it's almost over
thank you guys for coming i think this

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:20,130
might be the smallest crowd i've seen
any session this weekend although this

3
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,130
morning was really light I think you
guys party too hard

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,849
I don't know how you all do that and get
up processions attend in the morning

5
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:33,809
that's just impossible anyway so I'm Ben
Stillman i work from Radio Corporation i

6
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,629
am a principal consultants I'm married I
have two kids like motorcycles i am a

7
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,360
data nerd and i'm going to go ahead and
put the contact info up now so this is

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,500
really boring stuff

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,850
admittedly so if you feel like taking
off take a picture of the slide feel

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,370
free to email me contacting whatever you
want

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,750
no harm no foul if you leave I'm not
going to be offended so where do we go

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:07,020
in my career I see a lot of customer
databases and what it's a pattern that i

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,460
see over and over and over that a
developer or systems administrator was

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,339
tasked with installing mysql or Maria DB
and went as far as to make it work and

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,030
then left it there so nothing's been to
nothing's been configured and nothing's

16
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,990
been secured

17
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,158
there is a really cool utility that
comes with every install i think since

18
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,100
like Bordeaux called MySQL secure
installation this should be ran on every

19
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,000
install MySQL Maria TV as soon as you do
it

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,700
so what does it do well I don't you can
see that well enough but you just run

21
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,890
the binary mysql underscore secure
underscore installation and it just goes

22
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,950
through the first thing you will do is
it'll ask you for your password if you

23
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,700
haven't set one of this is a brand-new
install there'll be no root password so

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,320
again there's no another reason why it's
important to run this so set the root

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,259
password

26
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,260
pretty simple

27
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,880
by default mysql as anonymous users so
you want to drop those and that's what

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,190
this one of that thing's this utility
will do also by default the root user

29
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,720
can log in remotely from any host so you
want to strip that out who should only

30
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:26,410
ever be logged into from the local
machine and then next two drops the test

31
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,540
database part of the regression testing
packages that come with every install

32
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,560
MySQL Marie Devine is this test database
and the anonymous users have full access

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,470
to this test database so imagine the
conundrum is that a developer is using

34
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,500
the test database for I don't know
production data that they're testing

35
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,260
with and they haven't done any of this
you have anonymous users that can

36
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:55,299
connect to the test database and do all
this data and then finally it reloads

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,180
the privileges table and then it cleans
up and finishes and thank you

38
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:08,500
that's pretty much it right new plan in
my school secure installation you're

39
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,959
pretty much done or are you

40
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,959
yeah mission accomplished

41
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:24,430
so what does what doesn't my school
secure installation do well everybody

42
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,760
knows to look for a root user it's kinda
like SI and sequel server everybody

43
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,250
knows it's there so you should change it
i always recommend changing the root

44
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,350
user to something you know in this
example purple elephants jg whatever

45
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:49,829
default user names are bad and every
essence so get rid of them

46
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,050
siblings there have been these are just
the first six cds that I could find

47
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,070
relating to symlinks it seems like
there's a new one every couple of years

48
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,180
siblings are dangerous and allows my
school to follow them

49
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,970
so imagine somebody gains access and is
able to create a similar to my school

50
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,630
that user table and load their own
privileges table you can imagine and it

51
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,750
just then next time I school restart it
loads that privilege stable and they

52
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,839
have full access to your box in your out
and Maria DB you said have underscore

53
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,909
symbol equals 0 to disable it

54
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,110
you want to check the syntax for
different versions some places it was

55
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,140
follow some links equal zero some of
them is disabled symlinks equal one so

56
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,460
just check the syntax of the version of
my school i'm ready to Iran but disable

57
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:49,349
some links local in file so I many of
you probably done like that load data

58
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,940
infile and then loaded csb your text
document or something to load a ballpark

59
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:01,919
batch of data local in file is on by
default and it allows a user from their

60
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,020
desktop or laptop to run the load data
and you can imagine the problem of

61
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,000
having one user keep trying to do in
this example why can't I am court 65

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,820
billion records csb from my laptop

63
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,419
you'd be amazed people try it if they
have access to it they read it on the

64
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,200
Internet

65
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,719
oh ok I can do that then so disabled
that you can imagine the denial service

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:34,020
on yourself having couple of people do
that at the same time name resolve skip

67
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,469
it

68
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,330
dns breaks dns can be poisoned p.m. dns
can be faked

69
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,070
so this best bet is to disable
completely and we're mysql uses this is

70
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:49,110
in mostly user privileges so in which
will cover that shortly but you know you

71
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,880
have a user Joe at you know abc.com just
use the IP address instead

72
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:05,159
and this one is kind of scary will go
into more depth with this later but

73
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,790
sequel mode equals no auto create user
essentially by default if you issue a

74
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:17,460
grand statement for a user but don't
specify a password and the user doesn't

75
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:31,169
exist it will create the user without a
password so what else can we do users

76
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,070
and roles

77
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,030
first we're gonna cover you losers
everybody knows the basic and create

78
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:42,690
user username at IP address identified
by him some awesome password always be

79
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,969
as specific as possible with the host if
you can't say ten that one that one . 14

80
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,740
you can do 10 that one that one . % so
it's not anything on the 10 11 network

81
00:06:52,740 --> 00:07:01,110
you can also limit by subnets you can
even do you know 10 . percent if you

82
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,860
want to do anything is better than at
any host which is what i see all the

83
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,070
time always try to restrict users only
be able to log into the application

84
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:15,300
servers or whatever and always always
always use passwords

85
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:23,190
this is what I was talking about a grand
statement grant select on DVD star to

86
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,740
new user this user doesn't exist

87
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,920
you just ran a grant without an
identified by password it's going to

88
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,270
create that user and have a wide open
and neonatal have select access on

89
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:40,590
everything all tables in the DB database
without a password so that's why you

90
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:48,390
want to set this equal underscore mode
equals no auto create user so if you

91
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:53,610
wanted to create user by using a grand
statement just use identified by and

92
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,610
your password

93
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:06,660
next and this one's kind of exclusive to
Maria DB mysql a point I was introducing

94
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,150
roles but that's I believe not even
released candidate yet rated beside role

95
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,820
since tell you can essentially create
instead of having to manage you say you

96
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,650
have 500 dba's you really want to manage
500gb a accounts and all the different

97
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,020
individual privileges go along with it
or do you just want to create a

98
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,950
read-only role or a DBA role or any
other role you want you could think of I

99
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:42,539
signed the privileges to the role and
then create grant that role to users so

100
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,730
you've added to my school and really be
database up for awhile how do you know

101
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,150
if you have any password or any users
without passwords it's actually pretty

102
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:56,730
easy you just look for an empty set and
the password column be my school . user

103
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,830
table and then you can go through and
set a password for each of those users

104
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,970
without a password and we really really
amazing how many users you have call and

105
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,900
complain after you set passwords like
hey why can't i login now that's because

106
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,670
you create an account without a password

107
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:19,170
same deal find any users at any host
just find where the host equals $OPERAND

108
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,569
% and then you can just you can rename
the user so in mysql Andrea DV a

109
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,270
username is not just the bent portion of
this it is the been at so a user you

110
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,620
know been at localhost and then at ten
that one that one that 14 are identified

111
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,560
as two completely separate users in my
school's you can assign different

112
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,229
privileges based on where the users
logging in

113
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,490
so an example that would be if you had a
DBA that's logging into VPN vs locally

114
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,190
at the office you can give broader
privileges for local access as opposed

115
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,190
to logging in remotely over VPN

116
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:12,010
I don't believe you can assign roles
roles would be kind of cool though

117
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,380
but the underlying structure of the role
appears as almost as if a user so i

118
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,540
wouldn't work very well but what you can
do we'll get to in a minute is mapping

119
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:34,030
like Active Directory and adapters so
the password hashing prior to think it

120
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,949
was anything older than 50 used an older
and secure password hash the easiest way

121
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,240
to find out whether you have users with
this old hatching or not is to simply

122
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:51,370
find do is select on the my school I
user table here let's see this which is

123
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,650
better for the password is less than 41
characters then you know it's using the

124
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,630
old hash and in order to set the
password you can change the password was

125
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,080
using a set password command obviously
if you don't know where the password was

126
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,330
you're gonna cause some problems

127
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,230
ideally you this is an application user
or something that's you know the

128
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,630
password and you can just set it to the
same thing but it will use the new

129
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:21,100
hashing algorithm once you've done that
you want to make sure you have old

130
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,630
underscore passwords equals 0 NE of the
newer installations have this this is

131
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:35,800
more for the orders you know older stuff
thats hanging around legacy stuff so

132
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,079
they get privileges granted privileges
on starts guard Joe at any host see that

133
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,250
all the time

134
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,230
you not only want to restrict the host
as much as possible but you also want to

135
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,530
restrict the privileges you know you
don't want hundreds of users in your

136
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,230
database that in your lord knows are
probably not being cleaned up and

137
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,340
deleted when they get fired or quit or
whatever they have access to everything

138
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,440
any kind of body you're gonna fail it on
this what you'd like to do is narrow it

139
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,400
down to the exact database if possible
if they need access to all databases

140
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,640
they don't need all privileges they
don't need file that only process they

141
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,630
don't need reloaded

142
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:16,480
probably just need select or select
update insert delete or sometimes

143
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:26,320
process but they don't need everything
so an example here then is grant select

144
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,980
on DVD . star so that gives them select
access on every table inside d1 and you

145
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,410
can grant insert update on TV too .
table a so you can actually go down to

146
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,410
the table level privilege of what
they're allowed to do so they can select

147
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:54,250
anything from d1 and insert update on
anything on the table a and db2 that's a

148
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,560
nasty query but this finds user this
list out all the users and all of the

149
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,349
global privileges that that user may or
may not have and it will be marked with

150
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,550
a wife or yes or an end for know this is
a good way to go through and just still

151
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,359
periodically audit what are your
security privileges in your database

152
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,210
what accent what users have global
access to all tables you know the user

153
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,830
that was created for five years ago long
before you added the new HR database may

154
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:27,730
have global privileges that you didn't
even know about and to show an

155
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,270
individual user's grants you can always
do show grants for and then the user and

156
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,240
that'll give you the exact grant
statements you need to recreate that

157
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:42,670
user in that in another database or
somewhere else and that's always one of

158
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:50,680
my favorite comics it's so easy to steal
passwords so in this example we're

159
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,670
talking about you create a fake service
that does something at arbitrary that a

160
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,719
whole lot of people want to use and they
sign up for it with using a password and

161
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,860
then you use that password but the
reason for that is people share

162
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:09,550
passwords are not share but shit people
use reuse passwords so how do you keep

163
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,949
that from happening within your database
file already has a couple plugins one of

164
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,970
them is the simple past were checked

165
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:27,709
very simple to install and very easy to
configure what's the minimum length you

166
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:34,489
want for your passwords how many and
numeric digits do you want do you want

167
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,319
it all the same case or do you want to
make it mixed case and you want to force

168
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:47,990
special characters so in this example
then if i try to set the password to ABC

169
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,339
it's going to fail because it doesn't
it's not a character's it's not

170
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:55,339
happening Marik it's not mixed case and
it doesn't have any special characters

171
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:57,740
but then if i use that nasty

172
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:04,790
p for dollar sign S word that one will
work but that's a dictionary based

173
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,009
password so that's not very secure

174
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:11,300
it's better than what we had before but
it's not very secure may have cracked

175
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,189
clip passport check plugin as well which
actually loads and from a dictionary

176
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:24,319
file and you can specify your file so
now when we try to use that same p for

177
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:25,550
dollar sign S word

178
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:31,128
it won't because it's fading based on a
dictionary word so these are all just

179
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:36,740
different you use these two password
plugins in combo and it'll help it

180
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,740
doesn't eliminate it but it helps reduce
the likelihood that somebody is using

181
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:48,920
you know password as their password or
something really dumb password like that

182
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,878
would work

183
00:15:49,879 --> 00:16:01,730
so then what else can we do for user
authentication well we have the eunuch

184
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:07,670
socket authentication plugin which
assumes that if the user has access to

185
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:14,149
the operating system and they have
access to log into the database so in

186
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:20,120
this example we've installed the plugin
to Who am I then create a user won't

187
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,019
work at localhost v identified via a
eunuch socket try to login with that

188
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,960
user and it won't work because I'm not
want

189
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:32,980
work I'm been so that created user been
at localhost identified via a eunuch

190
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,280
socket now login with that username and
it works

191
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:44,650
no passwords to manage it's all handled
through the unification additionally you

192
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:50,890
have the pan plug-in everybody knows
what Pam it probably you can a setup am

193
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,280
to authenticate to all kinds of
different things and then create your

194
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:02,470
user identified via Pam and I think a
trip am now this can be used for ldap

195
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,500
Active Directory all kinds of cool
things like for instance here's ldap

196
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:16,540
with ldap we can even do group mappings
so we can say ldap group dba's gets you

197
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:25,300
setup proxy users and see if i have an
example so DBA group it gets the DBA

198
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,240
proxy user the accounting group gets the
accounting proxy user then you create

199
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:41,890
and here's the actual Pam config you
grant all privileges on startup start to

200
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:48,220
DBA CBS get all privileges and then you
grant select only on d1 . invoices to

201
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,970
your accounting department and we create
and I hate to say this an anonymous user

202
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,380
this is a catch-all because you don't
actually have an account on the local

203
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,150
machine on the local database we do it
using proxy users so what we do is we

204
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:11,560
create this anonymous user and then we
granted proxy and that ldap mapper is

205
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,179
going to map the DBA group to the DBA
users so when a user logs and initially

206
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,440
are logged in as an honest but then the
map to the DBA proxy user so they have

207
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,380
whatever approaches DA has the same
thing with the user that logs with

208
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,010
account has an accounting group they're
going to login as that anonymous user be

209
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,330
mapped to the accounting proxy user this
way you don't have to manage all of

210
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,830
these users

211
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:43,600
so an example would be Who am I then
groups i'm in a DBA group i login as

212
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,830
user been and it works fine

213
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:55,629
same thing with Jo Jo's in accounting
login with Joe now joe is actually

214
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:07,929
logged in as the accounting user now we
create a user called leet and he's in

215
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:11,679
the group acts or and try to login with
him and he's not there because he's not

216
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:21,909
in the DBA or accounting groups so what
else can you do with Pam well you can

217
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:25,990
use RSA securid two-factor
authentication have pantothenic 82 it

218
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,380
and now when your users log into the
database they have to login with an RSA

219
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,279
security

220
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:35,320
alternatively google authenticator works
as well

221
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:46,449
two-factor authentication isn't perfect
but it's a lot better than nothing

222
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:59,710
then we can also indicate with kerberos
it's currently in beta i believe it's

223
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:07,210
supposed to be mark GA and really be 10
to but it's fairly simple once you get

224
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,559
the configuration you install the
plug-in which again just like any other

225
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,220
plug-in installed so name the name of
the plug-in already there in the plugins

226
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:23,649
directory in your configuration you need
to tell it where the key follows and

227
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:30,399
what the principal name is and then you
just create the user then at whatever

228
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,469
identified via gssapi as 10 / more ATP

229
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:46,350
this way you can kind of get your
password management out of the database

230
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,649
you're already using some sort of
central authentication why not just any

231
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:56,730
key to it so next up it would be
connection encryption i would say it's

232
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,390
probably about five to ten percent of
customers that I see on a daily basis

233
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:05,730
that are using ssl/tls connections for
my school Marie to be the biggest

234
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,730
complaint here is about the overhead
your performance overhead when in

235
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:16,500
reality there isn't much of one to
configure it is very simple on the

236
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,990
server side three lines on the client
side two lines and you restart your

237
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,929
server and you show global variables
like have SL if they also yes which they

238
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:32,520
should that means as the cells
configured and now it's as simple as

239
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,980
creating your users or modifying your
users to require ssl or use ssl people

240
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:45,750
want to acquire it now your connections
will automatically use ESL you want to

241
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,710
be very careful that your application is
configured to use ssl for any SSO users

242
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,110
on the client side it's easy like not
the maximum ice creamery to be quiet

243
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,570
just add those two client lines to the
configuration file but your java

244
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,360
connectors your PHP connectors
everything else needs to be configured

245
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,360
to use ssl as well

246
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,760
additionally you can even use a selfie
replication have master-slave

247
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,309
application setup it's you know you
imagine already have master-slave pair

248
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:22,379
set up you're not using ssl it's as easy
as granting usage is little trick to add

249
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,490
additional grants without changing
anything to require ssl he's got your

250
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,570
slave then you run the change master to
master underscore SL equals one and

251
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:36,270
restart your slave now your applications
going over ssl additionally you can use

252
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,918
a cell for Clara it's a little bit more
complex but not its one config line

253
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:57,980
and you can use ssl for your i do the
calera SSTs they additionally there's

254
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,330
data encryption there are so many
different options for data encryption

255
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:13,129
new and Maria DB is data at rest
encryption these were patches supported

256
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:22,520
are submitted by google to us google and
Perry you create your key file and then

257
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,260
you configure the add the configuration
line file key management filename and

258
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,410
which looks like that keys . text
example you have no key number one

259
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:37,250
semicolon the key there are lots of
different configuration options for the

260
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:41,150
first thing i do is load the plug-in
then you say file key management the

261
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:46,010
path to the file encryption algorithm
where you're going to encrypt temp

262
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,640
tables are not temps in temp files what
you're going to encrypt the binary log

263
00:23:49,640 --> 00:24:04,820
etc etc again just more options for the
encryption how do you use it to create

264
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:11,540
table table has two columns ID and value
you just encrypted yes encryption key ID

265
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,879
equals and that matches that key file so
there's one key say use key number one

266
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:26,990
if you want to encrypt an existing table
it's just an alter table statement so

267
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:32,510
some words of caution of using addressed
encryption this locally log is not

268
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,790
encrypted so if you have very sensitive
data in your queries and it's slow and

269
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,680
it's love and so curry log that's in
clear-text same thing with the general

270
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,840
career log and the error log the error
log is especially scary because you

271
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,260
could have full stack trace dumps dump
to the air log

272
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,560
with all kinds of information glarus if
you use galera synchronous replication

273
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Aguilera cash is not encrypted as well

274
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:07,610
nada plugins not encrypted etc etc etc
so it's not a catch-all and of course

275
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,949
only the data arrests in group encrypted
so if you have that the server's up the

276
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,070
servers running which hopefully your
database servers you know 9.59 zup

277
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:21,169
sequel injection any kind of access to
the database this does not protect you

278
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:26,780
from that is chronic rip it then
additionally there's the Perry gateway

279
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:32,389
it's essentially a proxy that you would
route all of your data of your insert

280
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,900
update delete and select through and it
encrypt and decrypt data on the fly

281
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:43,550
this is a commercial product but they
helped embed the native encryption into

282
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:52,280
Maria TV there's des encrypt and decrypt
functions you can actually encrypt the

283
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,770
data as you're inserting it

284
00:25:54,770 --> 00:26:13,879
this only works if ssl/tls is enabled so
here's an example of a key file with

285
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,030
five different keys you can have up to
10 keys in this file

286
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,650
unfortunately that as of right now
there's no native key rotation but you

287
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,220
could if you wanted to write your own
two in the back and a background process

288
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:30,290
to open data that has already been there
and we encrypt with the new key

289
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,220
and here's how to special to the
encryption of the data by based on the

290
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:50,399
key file instead of actually using a
password phrase or string to do the

291
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:59,699
encryption now generally your best bet
is to encrypt the data and the

292
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,230
application you send encrypted over the
wire you stored encrypted in the

293
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,620
database the database had only the
encrypted data in your database is

294
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,229
compromised it doesn't have the keys
that don't have a way of decrypting the

295
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,230
data so your day is fine

296
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,809
the downside of course would be you
can't run search queries very easily

297
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:24,690
you can't do select star where colony is
like because there's no way of saying

298
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,360
you know this encryption key looks like
this encryption key

299
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:40,799
it's obviously not going to work and
then lastly we have the Maria TB audit

300
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,700
plug-in again simple to install

301
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:51,629
configuring it you can set it to
automatically purge you can set it to

302
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:56,610
rotate you can set it the largest this
log you can set it so that a user cannot

303
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:59,158
disable it

304
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,940
the only way to disable it would be to
restart mysql with a different config

305
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,929
variable that server CS server
underscore auto equals force plus

306
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:11,669
permanent if that's their it cannot be
disabled dynamically you have to shut

307
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:16,320
down ready be removed that line and then
started back up in order to today to

308
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:23,428
disable the auto plugin you can specify
what users to audit or what users to

309
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:27,389
exclude so for instance if you want to
exclude everything you know if you

310
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:30,590
wanted to log everything but route you
can just exclude group

311
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:42,949
and that's an example of what it would
look like logging everything that's

312
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,860
logging the kinect is logging and
disconnect it's logging the right it's

313
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:50,779
telling where it happened who did it
from where you can log regular queries

314
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:56,090
you can get pretty much anything you can
look at all or you can say only long

315
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:01,070
selector only that's a log DML or only
love ddl it's completely configurable

316
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,710
you can have it set up whichever way you
want this was originally designed for

317
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:12,049
PCI HIPAA compliance because the general
curry log is not very great for auditing

318
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:16,309
hotels use query in the user or is this
will give you at least a little bit more

319
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:21,770
information and it's open source it you
can actually download the plug-in and

320
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,520
installing mysql if you don't wanna run
i really be it'll run on my school as

321
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:36,168
well and that's it

322
00:29:36,169 --> 00:30:08,659
that went a lot faster than I thought it
would be questions I'd have to double

323
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:12,679
check but I think we're only doing one
right now I think it's they bought

324
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,679
everything else out well but i have to
double check

325
00:30:23,500 --> 00:31:01,450
I'm generally not sure I have to check i
generally don't know i'm sorry i don't

326
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:58,480
know what you mean by IP queries or i
don't think i know there are a couple of

327
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:07,090
functions around IP addresses Aton but
i'm not entirely sure what all you could

328
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,120
do with that or not but if you shoot me
an email i will gladly find out

329
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:45,540
now he can't shoot me an e-mail find out
where his heart say I think you used to

330
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:53,430
be able to but you can't anymore but you
can do is you want to do something like

331
00:32:53,430 --> 00:33:00,270
your databases are all named da DB and
then a letter you want to do like DP % .

332
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,110
star

333
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:08,280
I don't believe that works generally
that's not something you want to do but

334
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,750
one cool thing you could do he wanted to
set up something like that so you have

335
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:17,760
everything DB and then a letter you can
use replication filtering to replicate

336
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,690
to a slave server replicating only the
databases that match TV star or dvd % to

337
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,570
another slave server and grant access to
all the day with databases on that

338
00:33:27,570 --> 00:34:01,560
server for crimping it on the
application side just the fact that

339
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:08,190
you're not storing the data in the
database you're using like the dias

340
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:19,260
I wouldn't do that either downside to
that is your applications open to the

341
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,600
world I soon web server

342
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,679
yeah so now your databases on a surface
open to the world so generally you want

343
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,690
to do private i wanna know your upward
facing application server and then on

344
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,909
the database server have that on a
private network to bring mikey i

345
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:41,400
wouldn't recommend having your database
on the server this over with I i ah but

346
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,000
as far as do i I and obviously
encryption at rest is only going to be

347
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,409
good for somebody else

348
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:53,669
spencer it's just hard drive but
depending upon what policies you have to

349
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:59,430
abide by on HIPAA data or ecial are some
of the European regulations and now

350
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:07,200
something happen quickly my email
addresses usually those are insufficient

351
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,390
to use data at rest and cooking for a
lot of those it would put an email

352
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:17,250
address or name or anything like that on
how sensitive data your story but I look

353
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,210
at probably DES encryption functions
being able to encrypt the data actually

354
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,270
in a call as long as you don't need to
do some sort of searching for that data

355
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:28,650
long as you can imagine you i want to
return all the records where an email

356
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,850
address is this

357
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:47,549
that way you can encrypt this and then
finding the game or decreases Diego

358
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:54,600
truecrypt avenues that 12 more
applications
