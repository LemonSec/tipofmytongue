1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,270
I know right away that ok

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,479
welcome to to catch a penetration tester
there I we're going to talk about our

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:36,989
top sim use cases today so it is a chris
hansen to catch a predator theme so why

4
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:43,078
what was your plan for coming here today
we're going to talk about a little bit

5
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,910
about us going to talk about some of the
methodology and criteria that we came up

6
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,069
with to presenting the top ten you sim
use cases that were talking about today

7
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,370
we're going to go over some
recommendations and just in case you

8
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,440
didn't know our theme is that Chris
Hansen is the blue team and the

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,789
penetration testers are the perverts and
so that's also also attacker so

10
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,049
penetration tester pervert attackers
external attacker we're talking about

11
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,180
the same thing that's what are you

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,500
that's what are youse cases are what
we're talking about today a little bit

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,360
about myself in this order

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,670
I'm a Christian and a husband and a
father I oversee an information security

15
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,020
program of I've graduate of RIT yeah I
don't have a football team won the

16
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,490
football team but yeah

17
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:45,310
that's right won every game 13 years
infosec experience I've nine years

18
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,030
specifically with the sim deployments
have two different simox because

19
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,479
experience backgrounds this talk is a
vendor agnostic talk

20
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,070
this is coming from in just a lot of
this is coming from experience from us

21
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,939
and the people we know what we're
talking about today i've implemented

22
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:06,610
over 12 different enterprise security
systems from the ground up that means

23
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:13,420
starting from a problem to a full
program in a salute a program as

24
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,208
mentioned before I think i mentioned
that i developed two different security

25
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:22,180
operation programs i spoke last year on
simplified some use case management

26
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,280
really trying to identify and present
how we manage our monitoring systems

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,430
such as sim and how to best track and do
everything we can and try to boil the

28
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,299
ocean so check that out from last year
introduced you Pete

29
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:45,549
hey how's everyone doing so I'm Greek as
you can tell by the last name from a

30
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:51,609
terrible golf or I drink bourbon a lot
better i guess I about 15 years infosec

31
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:59,620
mostly blue team dabble in the red a lot
have some starts and now I've been i

32
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,359
think i missed one year and so I've been
here five times and first time speaking

33
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:13,090
and that's me in a nutshell people so
why we're here

34
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,829
you know people were very blue and but
we love coming a derby on and talks like

35
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:23,079
this because understand what the Reds
doing in and really when we go to event

36
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:28,299
like this are our goals to come home
with some ideas for organizations in our

37
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:35,049
employers you know there's a and and so
we wanted to share just to share what we

38
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,420
love about coming to two cons like this

39
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:43,208
the typical derby contact the typical
top con talk would be to you explain a

40
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:47,650
technology you hack it to defend it but
every time every time and every one of

41
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,330
those talks there's a little bit of

42
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,330
well how do you detect it assess we're
talking about focusing on today we are

43
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,070
sharing a collection of the use cases in
mass quantities

44
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,980
hopefully within one talk we hope to
address the question what can most blue

45
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,380
team's do that most likely catch red
attackers in most environments

46
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:19,810
add to that so questions who have to see
him

47
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,220
great yeah are you detecting the right
things that your mailbox get blown up

48
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:35,170
with alerts and you just ignore him
won't be honest haha so I've got

49
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:40,030
confused you know rides a big Christian
fan I've seen a few episodes so you know

50
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,229
in one hour

51
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,330
was it now yeah in one hour with
commercials he caught the perv and i

52
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,650
read somewhere it takes us blue team
errs a hundred sixty-five days the catch

53
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,950
an attacker so I don't know I'm just
saying things are broken

54
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,270
we're not doing a good job with the sims
they're full of shit and get ya but

55
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,219
Peter those sins have out-of-the-box
content to detect the attackers

56
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,330
what are you talking about i mean they
stock you pay thousands of the thousands

57
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,919
of dollars for them in it

58
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,919
well okay use block yeah

59
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,570
yes that's the answer which would be so
what you might be thinking are some

60
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,409
assumptions before we get started on our
use cases we understand that prevention

61
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:29,320
is first and foremost no doubt we should
be focusing on prevention we're going to

62
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,430
assume that most organizations are have
done i've already done are doing

63
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,390
everything they can they have pension
penetration testers they they're doing

64
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,860
they have a probability mode management
program the assumption is that there's

65
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:48,580
processes in place to to do the
prevention and most organizations have a

66
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,380
monitoring program such as an MSP my I
managed security service provider or

67
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,110
in-house in place similar a little bit
of both

68
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,990
it's sometimes and we understand that
sometimes risk to vulnerabilities

69
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:09,190
our address by simply or you just cannot
prevent or protect you protect something

70
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,030
you can't if you can't install a patch
for example who knows i'm just throwing

71
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,400
example you you you you have a
vulnerability and you have a requirement

72
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,270
for the business to continue or your
organization to kid continue with that

73
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,049
vulnerability that risk is sometimes
mitigated through detection

74
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,570
we're also going to assume that the
audience knows the attacks were talking

75
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,150
about the attacks were talking about her

76
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,280
it's nothing sexy it's nothing i think
every most people have heard of these

77
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,219
before

78
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,700
yes so the methodology we used was is we
surveyed our friends who are pant asters

79
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,500
into forensic specialists who actually
do that and it was two different types

80
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,970
of perspectives that came in to us which
I'm not gonna thunder but it's basically

81
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:07,960
lateral movement and neck still the most
of these use cases so anyways that was

82
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,349
our methodology and we'll go into some
criteria here so we analyze the data

83
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:18,130
based on criteria and that's a place in
next time yeah so so we go ahead so we

84
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,219
reached out to several penetrates just
another security Penta Penta

85
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,270
professionals to get their advice I hate
this is our criteria

86
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,930
this is kind of how we want to format in
please send us your top five sim use

87
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,930
cases and so we gathered that

88
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:40,150
so what is the same use case manager i
talked about this last year it is a

89
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,650
document and output for your sim or
monitoring program in $YEAR civic and

90
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,940
simplistic terms that's what your what
your sim to do and it defines the who

91
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,160
what where when why how and then when
you get and like we're talking about

92
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,350
alerts today actually what we're
presenting is actionable alerting logic

93
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:05,290
that will detect that will propel spawn
an alert that most organizations should

94
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,670
be doing

95
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:15,140
so the use case criteria we asked the
submitters to do was to really think

96
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,719
about what would you know what kind of
alert could be generated in the kill

97
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,510
chain and you know typical intrusion .
the scenario that that be throughout the

98
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,950
submitters was fish compromise
workstation still credentials and stuff

99
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,120
lateral movement and stuff in an exfil
and we got some good results back to

100
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,120
share those with you and in like i said
earlier slide a lot of them really were

101
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,060
the lateral movement in the expo at the
very end so I mean that's what we'll

102
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,660
talk about

103
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:54,079
yeah we did seem to get a lot of lateral
movement detection use cases so the

104
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,980
criteria that we we're looking for in
our stimulus cases additionally was

105
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,510
there the doable and ninety percent of
organizations you know we're assuming

106
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,630
that there's basic technology exists in
an organization there's an assumption

107
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,790
that you have AV Vannevar IPS you maybe
got layer 7 firewalls possibly possibly

108
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,560
for proxies so typical basic
technologies and it is this really at

109
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,599
the theory level common infrastructure's
actor-director everybody as most people

110
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,680
most organizations have windows unix
databases but we just didn't we didn't

111
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,109
want to limit on specific technologies
but we did get several use cases on the

112
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,030
windows side which kind of makes sense I
guess they're also the stop the the

113
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:42,020
criteria is that the log feeds and a sim
already are typically exist most seven

114
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,420
when you deploy sim is out-of-the-box
type of integrations and windows seems

115
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,920
like it'd be a really easy integration
syslog very easy integration integration

116
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,599
is like that where most similar points
will have a log feed we also against we

117
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,950
wanted to make sure that the use cases
were talking about today or that they're

118
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,760
collecting and talking about today that
they're low effort to develop in the sim

119
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,550
there could be some really complex sim
use cases that involve correlating data

120
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:19,760
from you know data manage sometimes that
it that's it there's lots you could

121
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,260
correlate data with lists me

122
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,600
manually updated list and just
correlated with other data we're trying

123
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,540
to keep things simple today they can be
considered the basics of the must-do of

124
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,810
detection and we pick the top 10 of the
use cases that we selected based on

125
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:43,670
several factors one of them was common
themes of submission so we gotta use

126
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,939
case from one person to another person
another person well this is that we're

127
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,690
going to present on that and the other
thing that we talked about where there

128
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,810
were some uses use cases that kind of
overlapped and we talked about some of

129
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,189
the theory around it

130
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,910
well well this one use case does this an
issue in this case does this but this

131
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,750
one does

132
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,820
we'll catch this one as well so use case
a use case be it would also use case B

133
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,840
would catch these days eh and also
detect on be so it's we talked a little

134
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,070
bit about that

135
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,670
alright so let's get started into our
use cases we're going to go through our

136
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,640
top 10 and pete has the first one is so
this is a whole lot of data i mean to

137
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,270
take in so you don't know a lot of you
are going to try to read it all but I

138
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:30,020
i'll go over the format real quick so
you can get the basics and that will

139
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,370
dive right in

140
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,950
so for most of the title use case in
this case this is an authentication with

141
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:43,250
corporate credentials to an untrusted
site the fish the submitter just give

142
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,270
them some credit and the data source so
where it's coming from this case it

143
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:53,090
comes from a proxy log in a lot of
organizations don't log their proxy log

144
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,680
information or don't have proxies but in
this case we still chose us because we

145
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,810
thought this was a kind of neat one the
correlated data source is a lot of times

146
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,979
when you're working with the same you
have to put your own data into it so

147
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,360
this would be in this case with the fish
this will be a list of sites like for

148
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,820
instance are just throw some food
service now or any third-party software

149
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,800
services that your company might use
that are quote unquote authorized so

150
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,630
that's the list were using today that
that will be the whitelist on the goal

151
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,800
of this is to detect a compromised
account that had went out to fish and

152
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,510
offered up their user credentials the
description

153
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,780
just tell you a little bit more about
what the submitter was thinking and in

154
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,280
this case he was clearly thinking that a
user who had clicked on that link and

155
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,250
offered up their corporate ad user
credentials

156
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,030
I'm the pseudocode you'll see a lot of
different variations i apologize in

157
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:54,459
advance like summer coming out of some
of the popular awesome summer just plain

158
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,560
old good good pseudocode so in this case
like I said the log horse is from a

159
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:06,640
proxy log and in basically looking at
what was posted so if in the post body

160
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,520
did the user credentials mass you your
white list of our users and also wasn't

161
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,980
part of the white list of our website
you would alert on that and in typically

162
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,640
this is a one that you would i mean i
would recommend that you would

163
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,400
automatically to say either disabled an
account or reset password let the user

164
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,220
know and if you using any kind of
security education awareness framework

165
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,990
is is auto enroll them in the training
and hopefully gets better so that's so

166
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,350
that's what this one is is basically
about so we thought this was a unique

167
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,910
one

168
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:50,920
ok the next one is server to Internet
communication beyond a baseline so the

169
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,300
data source for this use cases is your
edge its networking equipment you have

170
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,219
your proxies your local firewalls local
war edge firewalls and the traffic

171
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:06,490
leaving your server networks so your
server networks in theory should never

172
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,900
initiate outbound connections to the
internet which then sends a log through

173
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,100
your firewall which goes into your
monitoring program this is where you

174
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,350
should develop a baseline of that
traffic and if you have traffic beyond

175
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,570
that baseline will that traffic shoot
that communication should the the

176
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,310
communication that initiated should be
investigate why did this for coming out

177
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:36,939
beyond our baseline some organizations
hopefully are blocking the egress of

178
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,950
their that the network of their server
should be in some kind of TMZ or

179
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,920
blocking the egress

180
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,069
to the Internet communications so
hopefully if that's ok you can servers

181
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,300
can still attempt they won't be
successful this use case still works

182
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,930
again the operations team roll out the
false positives and might pique pique

183
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,050
mentioned before if you can't read
what's on here there's a download link

184
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:09,779
below and i will provide the download
link to these use cases and the ones

185
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:17,910
that were submitted for you so I think
everyone heard of password spraying

186
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,399
right I'm Black Hills that's a good
video but anyways so user password

187
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,779
spring so this is what this would attack
the data source is the in your domain

188
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:36,660
controller logs the the correlated data
sources password spray user list so i

189
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,660
did so the goal here is is that a lot of
times when attacker gets in through a

190
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,889
fissure whatever they want to try common
passwords against your hole your whole

191
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:52,260
enterprise and so low and slow so this
is what this one to text and this could

192
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,649
be a little tricky to set up i have set
this one up

193
00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:00,269
it's a little tricky but I'm based on
the logic but basically you're looking

194
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:05,760
for account and you can use 10 or more
tensing to be my sweet spot but account

195
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,550
of 10 unique target's coming from the
same source IP with filled with the

196
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,810
field login and then you would alert on
that and typically that would be a sign

197
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,939
of a lateral movement

198
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,640
I'm and also password spraying what I've
seen is also done externally as well so

199
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,899
you could combine your firewall logs
here as well because they might be

200
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,970
trying to do this with burp or something
like that with owa as well so i wouldn't

201
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,500
only look at your domain cop to log i
would i would also mature it to look at

202
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,240
your firewall to get that source IP as
well like I said Black Hills did a

203
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,260
really good video on this about two
years ago in recon

204
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:52,480
so yeah so both Pete and I've
experienced that the this use case with

205
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,500
both and penetration testers not
necessarily attackers but penetration

206
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:03,520
testers have used this and and i think i
think one of the keys they test just

207
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,589
enough of the most unique passwords just
below your lockout policy so they're not

208
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:17,230
locking out users and when they get a
user account woman they win antivirus

209
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:23,110
virus detected on server so this is a
use case that detects stupidity

210
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:29,350
we all know that antivirus is certainly
did avoidable we but you know where

211
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,689
humans we make mistakes

212
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:39,490
not all criminals are smart so this and
also sims typically have an easy data

213
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:46,810
feed to monitor your entire system so
yes it may sound stupid but it's just

214
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:53,950
it's it's a very quick win we are it's
very quickly so we have experience with

215
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:00,220
system administrators when deploying
this use case that they say oh wow great

216
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,990
anavar is caught the server are caught
the virus why are you bothered now you

217
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:12,730
bother me you did it integrate well how
how to get there okay

218
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:18,160
they they they kind of need understood
okay yeah a lot of hacker tools are

219
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,240
detected by virus not all of them they
could be bypassed I get it but we make

220
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,240
mistakes

221
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,000
so this is a an obvious one here is a
windows workstation workstation

222
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,690
communication it was a submitted by both
Nick and Brett the forensic person they

223
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:50,140
see this a lot when they take an image
but basically so this would rely on you

224
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,370
having a good asset management knowing
what your workstations are knowing what

225
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,760
your knit I name extensions are for the
workstation that would be the correlated

226
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,970
day to source which you would have to
pump into your sim and keep that updated

227
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,790
but you can goal is to detect that
external attacker using whatever tools

228
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:14,290
to do lateral movement and no more
targets the description they did that

229
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,100
but basically the logic is really simple
here so if the source IP is in the

230
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,820
workstation list in a destination in the
destination IP some a workstation list

231
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,428
then alert potential lateral movement in
you know like I'm going to date myself

232
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:32,380
up to 20-30 years ago people might have
had share 20-30 years ago 15 years ago

233
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,799
people might have in common for people
to have shares on their workstations and

234
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:40,780
use this but now I mean I really think
in your common enterprise the this

235
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,678
shouldn't happen another thing the
submitters are saying it is you know you

236
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,210
really should have a policy against this
happen shares on your workstations so

237
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,750
this is kind of common but this time
like I feels a good one will catch some

238
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,070
good stuff and also when you do see this
you know there could be a lot more going

239
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,320
on with that workstation as well so to
mature this one computer correlated

240
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,668
against you know your AV logs or you're
back at your firewall walk so you could

241
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:08,919
really mature this one this isn't it
simple

242
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,120
engine a simple state because I guess
you could have some false positives but

243
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:20,649
writing again with with whether you
allow or deny workstation a workstation

244
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:28,330
traffic even if you deny it well it's
probably worth investigating this next

245
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:33,159
use cases user added to Windows local or
domain administrator group now a lot of

246
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:40,059
penetration testers attackers want to
get God likes uh you know access to your

247
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:43,610
your your domain and all the data that
it provides

248
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:51,110
it's a common who I made it goal for
attackers and penetration testers so

249
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,459
really any users attitude made
administrator group is against right out

250
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:01,100
of windows security event log it's a
pretty easy one to write rules on is

251
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:07,399
detecting privilege escalation so and
possibly persistence if you're not

252
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,620
monitoring you should really monitor the
group's list out some other groups here

253
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,030
other than domain administrator and
administrators enterprise admin scheme

254
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:21,678
admins are also the high-level types
created groups which should rarely

255
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,669
change unless there is a staff change
within your organization on your system

256
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:30,950
administrator side so let's say that
happens your you would get the alert

257
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,210
validate that from your access
management system or ticketing system

258
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,260
where however used due to document your
access changes make sure that that

259
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:45,440
changes valid its authorized if you
don't know ask your sis admins and if

260
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,910
you still don't know what then you gotta
securing investigation that start any

261
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,900
other point here is when you're
implementing that if you have an

262
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:02,030
enterprise good change management system
a lot of them do integrate with your sim

263
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:07,340
so you can actually integrated in such a
more automated fashion to see if there

264
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,439
was a change i'm almost positive he had
to reduce false positives or unit catch

265
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:23,000
a a sysadmin just not following policy
as well so this into this one is the

266
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,490
unauthorized service account successful
login to a server again this is your

267
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:33,679
debt and domain controller and the
couple things you have is going to have

268
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:39,590
is a service account list in hostname
baseline so this so basically the tables

269
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,199
gonna say hey this service account can
log into these three or four servers if

270
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,049
you see anything other than that alert
so you know this is another one in the

271
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:56,060
same like in Genesis someone got got a
surface count on in

272
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:03,050
I'm trying to use it with another server
to login so looking at that security

273
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:08,360
review that and again that could be
sometimes it can use this admin you know

274
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,600
that just try to use it you know to look
at that quickly rolled out and that's

275
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,740
that one there

276
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:25,220
this next one is windows new service
account creation registrations did this

277
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,800
one came from one of our forensic
professionals that we know this is a lot

278
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,480
of time

279
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,830
this is when a new one a new service is
created on a Windows workstation it

280
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:43,250
should be very very very rare that at
that ever occurs and should trigger you

281
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,720
to investigate when that occurs because
there's a persistence technique lot of

282
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,800
persistence techniques revolve around a
service creation so definitely take a

283
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:00,980
look at that workstations again this
also should never happen on workstation

284
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:07,790
servers again if you have change control
system that can i I you know find or

285
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,389
identify what changes are authorized
check that if it's not there

286
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:24,020
maybe invest start investigating a
security incident so that so this one

287
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,330
was interested was submitted it was seen
in actual and you know another forensic

288
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:36,830
analysis mr. Kyle performing non-service
count actions in this case assume you

289
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,480
have a service account its main job is
like the in life is to do backups to

290
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,430
make backups which executes the backup
service whatever on and all of a sudden

291
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:50,870
that service account starts mapping unc
dry start doing all kinds of other stuff

292
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,729
so for this one to really work again you
need to you

293
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,230
this one will take a little bit more
tuning but what we're saying here is is

294
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,540
that it would be a service account with
all the allowed of nid so this will take

295
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,760
about wild attune and do this but this
did I miss

296
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,600
very valuable and if you think about
power show execution if you're logging

297
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
that could help

298
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,360
so that's this one here and this was
submitted in this was seen in a

299
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,000
real-live compromise

300
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,270
yeah I was really I was really impressed
with this one because I you know it's

301
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:34,650
it's simple all your service accounts
and organization have specific should be

302
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,000
authenticating with specific event IDs
if you see something beyond that of any

303
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,010
ID something either is new or is being
used in a way that you really shouldn't

304
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:51,210
use that service account this one this
is the last one which we talked about

305
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:57,390
this is net flow or data upload
threshold exceeded traffic to internet

306
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:03,630
it's trying the attempt is here to
detect the exfil of your attacker you

307
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:11,760
got edged netflow firewall or proxy logs
we kept the word netflow in the title

308
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,090
because it is a very widely supported
protocol and service that's available on

309
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:24,480
almost dumb router type equipment and in
that your edge internet is as possible

310
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,330
so a lot of organizations could possibly
do it fairly easily and also sims

311
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,580
typically consume netflow and understand
and parse out the different fields such

312
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:42,360
as the bites out or octet it gets dr
cadets value which is the amount of data

313
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:49,649
leaving or in in your flow you want to
correlate that to server networks

314
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,970
workstations that might be very
difficult to do because people are

315
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,530
uploading users are uploading all the
time but if your servers are are

316
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:03,690
uploading data you know that's certainly
something that's worthy of investigation

317
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:12,720
so our threshold that we defined here is
and this is again coming from server

318
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,650
networks if you're if any sirt1 host
delivers

319
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,320
approximately 10 megabytes within a
minute from server to an internet or

320
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,850
untrusted or even trusted host you could
add we tried not to bring a third party

321
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,419
type of information or threatened almost
kinda like similar threat intelligence

322
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:40,290
like IP blacklist type of information
into our use cases but you can add that

323
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:47,730
possibly make the use case little better
and it's literally had some maturity

324
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:53,160
item with that I you know response is
typically to review for false community

325
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:00,210
detection identify you know what
communications was this it was trying to

326
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,660
do there is was reaching out to the
internet for some purpose is it a new

327
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,920
check your change control system is a
new service or new system that's that's

328
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:13,620
being installed on the on the server
then it escalated if you don't know what

329
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,979
it's all about having all your date
about time do that that's all I was our

330
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,910
last one the other last one so there's a
lot of honorable matches in it and we

331
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,560
encourage you to download this and I
participate are our goal really here is

332
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,950
too much and I'll say snorting on the
engine much to get as many use cases as

333
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,850
we can and rain come and put them out
there for the community so we're in the

334
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:44,969
infancy here so we're just starting now
and I the engine we hope to do this more

335
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:49,650
and more we hope to also learn from
everything here to make more use cases

336
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,230
or all the sessions

337
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,650
there's one just to point out about
halfway down the slide there's a new

338
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:00,750
virtual machine being spawned so there
was AI incident where the attack

339
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:10,320
actually four months had got the vmware
ESX credentials made a new host and then

340
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,000
I in off hours just would you know
exhales data there and pop it out so it

341
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,770
said so this is a good one to look at
home and you'll see that in there as

342
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,150
well

343
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:27,810
you can read the other ones i think a
good a good honorable mention back

344
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,049
that's okay

345
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:33,190
another good honorable mention that
didn't make the top 10 was powershell

346
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,779
detection unauthorized command of
PowerShell that is one that we kind of

347
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:41,230
knew about but didn't get to document it
fully

348
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:46,749
so I think it that would certainly a
contender for a top-10 as well so

349
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:54,519
awesomely all talking yes so
recommendations this is that the

350
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:01,059
recommendation part3 way here so what
I'm talented blue team has learned some

351
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:08,590
red run some tools see their logs do it
in dev don't in a while of course but

352
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,330
you can monitor production locks that

353
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:17,408
yeah yeah the next question is is this
is an important one you know when you're

354
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:20,230
you probably heard a number feat
especially last year i think this came

355
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,129
up a couple of talks but when you do a
third-party test and you know make sure

356
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:27,789
you put in your mouth you're going to
evaluate your use cases because anyway

357
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:32,320
you're gonna get better is by evaluating
yourself statement work you know and

358
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,178
then this is a good one kercher included
in your statement of works for you know

359
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:42,220
your third-party pentest haven't put in
section about some use cases like what

360
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,840
could have caught the attack

361
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,559
I mean I think that's important i mean
have them talk your language I mean

362
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:54,220
especially if you have you on that
engagement in the next one goes out to

363
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,200
when I was getting my GC IH think dad
always told us that you have learnt from

364
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,950
which around you learn from current
events if they if they publish the

365
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,090
anatomy attack like target or whatever I
mean learn from that there's a lot of

366
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,759
good things to learn those are all you
know there's like three or four use

367
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:16,749
cases you can implement their I'm if you
know for the red and you know when you

368
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:21,399
do your pan test report added you're
finding some use cases help us out

369
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:24,970
you know how to help us think like you
you know that's what that's what it's

370
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:25,899
all about

371
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:30,998
and another thing that i really like I
think some of the best pen test that

372
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:35,559
I've ever been a part of receiving on
being receiving at is where they

373
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:40,480
actually went step by step on anatomy of
attack and really looking at excellence

374
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:40,990
but

375
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,309
you get a lot of blue guys you know we
we get the tools we hear about it we

376
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:49,030
play a little bet but really
understanding that attack and where we

377
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:53,860
can identify that that point of
attraction is key so I mean that's

378
00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:00,580
really my advice and we have some time
here about 15 minutes so what's up

379
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,800
oh yeah do this one sorry yes like i
mentioned here's the URL for downloading

380
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:11,830
everything the presentation today and
all of our submissions we you know we

381
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:18,250
are inviting you to participate in this
effort to grow and then build the

382
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:24,550
publicly available sim or monitoring
program use case a database will call it

383
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:33,340
and so we understand that you make You
certainly have ideas and what you were

384
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,409
probably if you are out there and you're
saying well this is one where I really

385
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:42,460
know was really good and meets all the
criteria that we just talked about we

386
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,540
would really really appreciate and love
to hear from you just shoot us an email

387
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:53,740
and our emails are right here and and
and we also encourage you to when it

388
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,540
comes out if it ever does the hanson vs
predator has a kickstart enhances I

389
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,470
think splitting from I believe splitting
from Dateline and starting his own

390
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:08,559
little business and to continue with the
to catch a predator type series so

391
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:15,280
that's pretty exciting i'm going to open
it up to questions and comments we have

392
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,280
a few minutes

393
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:25,990
yes sir yes

394
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:40,919
so the question is with tight budgets of
organizations how does an organization

395
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,260
collect work station logs and perform
the use case that we talked about

396
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,850
there's several ways first is your
endpoint security systems if you have an

397
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,658
endpoint security systems that for
example has a local firewall or is an

398
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:58,650
antivirus system you should be
theoretically get them typically from a

399
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:04,289
centralized database or location . your
sim or monitoring tool to it and consume

400
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:05,460
that information

401
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,899
second the windows security event logs
can be centralized through windows event

402
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:15,540
forwarding to one server it could be a
one vm server on your network and at

403
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,820
that point you . your sim to collect the
data from that that one location that

404
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,470
one server the forward it's all the
workstations forwards the event logs to

405
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:30,118
that one server now be very careful
because you could go crazy with him you

406
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,619
gotta be we got to identify your use
cases for picking which event IDs will

407
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:37,619
go to that centralized server because
you'll overload it and you'll overload

408
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:45,000
the sim so in a budget sensitive
situation spin up a cheap p.m. hopefully

409
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,859
windows box turn on windows event
forwarding if you're off the network

410
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:54,659
there are ways to get that traffic into
that centralized windows forwarding

411
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,159
server

412
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,280
yeah that's a very good question that
answer your question

413
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:19,560
thank you any other use cases you got
fishing yes so the idea there is to

414
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,599
identify your users and all your
usernames the second list is identify

415
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,640
which websites should users in general
it may not necessarily be your

416
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,069
organization's websites but in general
what sites do they go to

417
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,670
baseline that site's yes there might be
some new domains that show up new

418
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,830
services online that show up that have a
username and password credential and

419
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:50,420
that except that we get that I it is
that what you think is that what the

420
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:57,350
concern is yes so it does read it does
require no it does not check for the

421
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:01,670
password it's looking for the string of
the username in your proxy logs of the

422
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:07,550
post your posting your username to make
the website that's not on a whitelist

423
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:17,990
domain list that's not password reuse
that's don't username reduce I never

424
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,979
heard of that but I does that does that
address

425
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:47,570
that's a good point if you vary . the
true that lets you could also put logic

426
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,620
in your the query from the proxy that
there's the word password in in in the

427
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:57,740
post or the get for the associated
getting post correct yeah good point

428
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,740
well yes sir

429
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,170
yes the question was how did you do

430
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:27,680
how did you baseline your server traffic
that was the question right

431
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:38,599
yes analysis data analysis and you could
go no sims ticket they can handle

432
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:44,539
possibly years worth of data you know
start with the month months worth the

433
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:49,039
query if you have that in your sim see
you uh you know see what traffic the

434
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,420
your servers are going out to and then
what you do is you would take that

435
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:59,450
baseline list maybe do some make a
report for your sis admins the owners of

436
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:05,839
those systems add some information like
what IP country is this in or what is

437
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,250
the who is on that are what is the
domain associated or the reverse dns

438
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:17,990
lookups on that post was the who is on
that what else could be if it's on any

439
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:22,459
threat intelligence list obviously any
third-party threat intelligence lists

440
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:30,019
what else could you do provide a report
get them to validate it

441
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:34,069
there are some obvious ones like
Microsoft hopefully you're not going to

442
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:37,160
Windows Update with your servers but you
know it's possible

443
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,538
ok exclude them and also for this use
case I wouldn't do a vdi environment

444
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:46,880
like oh I just hard that you might want
to write other use cases Ryan mentioned

445
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:53,990
earlier going to block with the right so
so so Pete's . was there are some

446
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:59,089
servers that for example there
user-based and you cannot do this with

447
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:06,230
and just don't even try this is really
trying to identify what we should know

448
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:10,369
in our environment and what's beyond
that baseline

449
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:13,369
yes

450
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:30,820
haha alright alright man you know they
will alert you got a certain time of the

451
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,260
day but the the question is the question
is how do you get your managed security

452
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,630
service provider to do these things

453
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,430
great question you you're entering if
you've entered an agreement let's say

454
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:47,200
you've already entered an agreement with
your mssb they my experiences they

455
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,319
typically consider it a feature request

456
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,190
ok get your feature requests in you have
to have your stuff your sim use cases

457
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,520
documented first that's why we're here
we're talking about we're trying to get

458
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,350
him out in the open here

459
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:05,170
mssp do this people are saying this is a
really good thing to do and it's putting

460
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,220
pressure on if you don't give you don't
identify your use cases it's all the use

461
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,660
case management's basics it you know
your organization is unique and that's

462
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,859
the thing that frustrates me about ms
ESPYs organizations unique the . got me

463
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,830
started

464
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:25,660
no that wasn't thank you thank you thank
you that was that is pushing and pushing

465
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:31,390
keep pushing them baby and eventually I
know my ok talking to mention anything

466
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,259
about this piece eventually i think as
you build your team and you get better

467
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,890
you know you get better and better at it
you have to make that decision to just

468
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,330
say hey I'm I'm just gonna bring it in
house and maybe use it at MSP for a

469
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,710
better reason i mean i was personally
part of that where we like I actually

470
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:53,530
toward the city trying to be not give
away so i actually toward their Center

471
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:59,020
when they brought up our customer name
they brought up our customer name it was

472
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,620
just sheets that like they would have to
look through all these notes in my

473
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,040
comment earlier was is the weekend was
predict within the hour when they were

474
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,740
going to call us so I mean it's great if
you don't have I think most species are

475
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,890
great if you don't have a an advance
team

476
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:20,250
but I think as you start getting there
you start to figure out that maybe I

477
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,250
could do this a little bit better

478
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:40,589
well my experience from out-of-the-box
tools is there they don't know your

479
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:45,690
environment like you do or analysis and
analyst does you and the same with MSP

480
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,070
sometimes they lose typically in general
they lose focus to you know what are

481
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,450
your service accounts

482
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:55,080
what are the servers that are supposed
to be sent reaching out to the internet

483
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,029
they typically don't know that it's in
it's almost it's almost a disconnect you

484
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,600
know they're out there and wherever they
are sitting at home and you're on the

485
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,730
office you know there's there there you
have to have good interactions with your

486
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,180
the system owners and the the actually
do things

487
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,430
yeah and I think I me Ryan implemented
up what we worked together at a company

488
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:21,600
and we spent most of the time just
trying to figure out what we had in

489
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,110
those assets we were talking about and
trying to figure out and that was really

490
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:30,720
like fifty percent of that initial
three-month period was really figure out

491
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,399
what assets we have and we were in a
large enterprise and in that's just the

492
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:35,970
way it is

493
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:43,680
pink is what's your line

494
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:56,460
yeah I'm the one I'm working with
currently I don't want to go to vendor

495
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,800
specifics most of the sims out there
most of the sims out there are are

496
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,910
pretty good it just comes down to
manually looking at baseline your data

497
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:10,980
I mean most of them can do that they can
export to csv file to some do some

498
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,000
pivottables able to give you unique and
all that like you know when your

499
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
baseline so they do give you some of
that

500
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:22,269
yeah good questions that we still got
some time

501
00:43:25,749 --> 00:43:30,488
what would you guys like to see more use
cases many use cases it's really hurt

502
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:37,269
like what you guys want to be able to
attack command line login was a

503
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:39,399
submission that yes thank you

504
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:47,949
yeah admin tools and data external any
other ideas how did the detective exfil

505
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:50,439
lots

506
00:43:50,439 --> 00:44:10,328
yeah okay yeah encrypted update uploads
of encrypted data i believe was a

507
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:12,309
submission there

508
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:17,829
yeah absolutely or are you saying
obfuscating for change for file format

509
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:42,909
or right so in order to the use case the
gentleman referenced is that a PNG or a

510
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:47,889
zip file can be changed to a PNG which
would then bypass some security tools

511
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:54,849
that's a good use case no I'm willing to
bet that most organizations are some

512
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:58,419
organizations may not have that ability
to detect that as they're leaving your

513
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:02,199
organization are assuming you know where
something that your basic firewall stuff

514
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,199
basic maybe an IPS might be able to
catch that

515
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:13,839
yeah i agree i agree absolutely guess
you'd send us an email reminders it

516
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:25,119
there's a right right yeah there's
there's several indicators of compromise

517
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,009
and like we said we had the it's a great
use case thank you in which we tried to

518
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:31,030
pick out the easiest

519
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:35,830
most organizations most blue team's
basics but the idea i love that idea i

520
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,350
love talking about this

521
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:42,339
so any other questions comments use
cases

522
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:48,070
alright we appreciate your time
everybody have a great day
