00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,009
repin la by Sarah thank you know this is
a sticker required to sign it

2
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:48,660
don't be jelly Joel sounds like you're
right you want to do this okay

3
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,379
hi everybody good morning I'm and I
managing need Herman and this is just a

4
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,239
normal and we're going to spend a little
bit of time talking this morning about

5
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,860
hacking in pop culture specifically gods
of geek mythology packing in popular

6
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:16,170
culture so in mass media journalism
hackers have been portrayed as these

7
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,200
sort of faceless boogieman they're
anonymous and more than one sense of the

8
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,530
word becoming sort of their own very
convenient plot device of vigilante

9
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:36,119
criminal or scapegoat or a sort of
modern-day folk devil with a very

10
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,509
well-known and stereotypical social
profile we all know this guy the hacker

11
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,399
their mail

12
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,689
they're white they're immature and
lacking in social graces or soft skills

13
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,039
resulting isolation many are overweight
live in their parents cave like

14
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,350
basements and are motivated by selfish
goals with hunger for power of chaos

15
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:06,400
and yet um entertainment media finds
hackers fascinating screen white writers

16
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:13,570
love introducing a hacker character and
wat because a hacker can create conflict

17
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:20,590
or save the day in one fell swoop in a
forceful compelling and believable way

18
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:27,430
that audiences except with the same sort
of mysterious and limitless power that

19
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:37,209
they would a witch or a wizard or a
dragon he accept their real at least

20
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:43,510
they're real in the audience's
perception so a mysterious and seemingly

21
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:49,179
limitless amount of power i want you to
think for a minute about the the

22
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,140
implications of that and we're going to
come back to that in just a minute but

23
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,429
for a little bit we're going to take a
closer look at some of the good the bad

24
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,230
and the ugly and film ok said the closer
look

25
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,000
we're gonna enhance enhance enhance

26
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,890
don't forget it and so we're pleased to
bring you the leet hacker profiles

27
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:21,070
confidential first one on one of my
favorites and her problem in your closet

28
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,049
starts was David Lightman for more games
in 1983 you guys have all seen the movie

29
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:31,269
i'm correct this is what I by I grew up
on wanting to be like so much more being

30
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,950
so fucking cool change your fuckin
school grades on your computer and ship

31
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,060
but David Lightman is a high school
student who connects is a few of his

32
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,560
classmates but he does connect with
attendees accompany college attendees

33
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,519
and also a girl in his class he finds
himself in trouble after looking for an

34
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,739
unrelated game looking for unreleased
games by war dialing and connecting to

35
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,209
the war operations plan response whopper
computer and almost starts world war

36
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:05,049
three with the Soviet Union who you guys
know about real genius the show real

37
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:10,090
genius you get a chance check it out
it's really great 1985 got tons of

38
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,970
montages from the eighties it's really
sweet but

39
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,959
this one Laszlo hollyfield a character
from there is a long-term student was

40
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,240
recluse school of geniuses he's smart
but he holds little social skills

41
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,240
probably know a few of us that might fit
that category

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,060
he leverages statistics and preset
content rules to win a vast majority of

43
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,360
major prizes and a snack food contest
this guy lives in a closet the past an

44
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,340
elevator that goes to the basement in a
school of geniuses and this is lhasa

45
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,289
hollyfield well to be fair it's a secret
lair that you access through a clock oh

46
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:55,480
yes yes that's just a closet Martin
Marty Bishop also known as bryce from

47
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,230
sneakers is another one of the
characters that we thought really sat

48
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,880
out and exemplified the hacker
stereotypes but this guy is more than SC

49
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,780
style he's the owner of a tiger team
security company with the team

50
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,710
specialized employees his main focus
appears to be in management social

51
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,760
engineering like I said he has a
previous long-term relationship and

52
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,599
several friends which you know make them
kind of well-balanced that he connects

53
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,550
with he gets in trouble with a few
unscrupulous people and you know maybe a

54
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:32,500
few nation states and finally was able
to come out ahead Dennis Nedry you guys

55
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,750
know this guy right

56
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,640
Jurassic uh-oh he's a computer
programmer jurassic park and due to

57
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,039
financial problems and low salary

58
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,640
sounds like a few people maybe not
getting the street in their organization

59
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,870
he accepted an offer from a competing
company to smuggle dinosaur DNA from his

60
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,070
employer he creates a backdoor program
that disables the park security so we

61
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,490
can escape without notice and of course
he gets eaten by the life source

62
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,720
zerocool from hackers I know this is a
staple of a lot of other people that got

63
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,460
their start you know he's a computer
whiz the aid of the age of personal

64
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,930
computers just getting started and after
getting coffee age of 11 he's court

65
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,130
ordered to have no contact with the
computers are touch-tone phones and as

66
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,080
1830 gets an opportunity once again to
jump in his computers and immediately

67
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,560
begins hacking only to find other people
are doing the exact same

68
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,230
and he jumps himself into the world of
hacking in new york city hack the planet

69
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:38,350
the planet Gibson trust your technical
lost all of those things

70
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:44,440
another one that kind of stable that I
can't grow up with but may not everyone

71
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,889
may not think of it as a hacker its of
course Michael Bolton wait Michael

72
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:56,440
Bolton Michael Bolton I mean is that his
actual name is an actual name just like

73
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,820
the ask on singers if you had my note in
fan

74
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:10,960
yeah move aside you guys get a chance of
funny or die did a skit with the real

75
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,409
Michael Bolton in several the scenes and
office space

76
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,630
it's very fucking good you should take a
look at that up so he's a program with

77
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,010
an attack working on a the year 2008 bug
and accounting software and a few other

78
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,450
programmers decide to frog the company
we're rounding transactions and stealing

79
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,820
differences only regret decision as he
might be going to the pound you in the

80
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,909
ass prison

81
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:44,110
yeah so next one is neo from the matrix
again from the nineteen nineties 99

82
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,970
thomas anderson also known as neo is an
item hackers always felt the world just

83
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,350
wasn't right and after meeting a few
unusual characters who finds out the the

84
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,120
world as he know is not old seems to be
it is an accepting that might mean

85
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,120
radical shift of perception so neo from
the matrix again this is kinda before he

86
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,580
kind of learns everything that his
environment exists daily jobson from

87
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,880
swordfish you guys remember this movie
right when he gets compelled to hack can

88
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,830
jump back in Stanley is out on parole
after hacking the IBM carnivore program

89
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,359
and is banned from using computers have
from being held at gunpoint Stanley is

90
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,830
thrusted back into hacking being forced
to support terrorism plots by creating a

91
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,650
worm or a possible losses daughter I
don't want to I don't want to get too

92
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,490
much off track here but i'm not sure if
the gun . was the most memorable part of

93
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:39,729
that

94
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:45,670
scene for me personally I so we move on
a like Halle Berry so acting has never

95
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:53,170
been not disputed on that so Elliot
Alderson from mr. robot is a cyber

96
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,250
security engineer hacker who suffers
from social anxiety disorder clinical

97
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,980
depression spends his time hacking in
private

98
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,600
lockpicking bag packing the private
lives of people around him and he meets

99
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,350
an anarchist who convinces him the best
thing would be to take down the largest

100
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:14,050
corporation in the world now mr. robot
has been praised over and over again as

101
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,329
being more authentic and real life in
his portrayal of its the exploits but we

102
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:25,120
kind of included him because he does fit
some of the closer stereotypes both in

103
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,300
his wearing of the hoodies and the mass
persona that him and his crew get kind

104
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,029
of fun adopt Lisbeth Salander with a
girl with dragon tattoo

105
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,060
she's a blackjack with unique skills and
great demand corporations she gets hired

106
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,599
to find information she uses a unique
talents to assist an underground

107
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,110
political journalist by an anonymously
leaving information about political

108
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,360
figures on the reporters machine

109
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,209
ok so wait a minute those profiles they
don't fit the hacker stereotype at all

110
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,569
I mean that's what that's what the bar
graph was supposed to be for all the bar

111
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:06,339
graphs were supposed to show really low
marks that they all had poor physique

112
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,540
and and that they were mature and they
had bad social skills and they were all

113
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,149
wicked so why why does the route

114
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,019
why don't the research results show that
what we're going to cover

115
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:22,360
ok so it's definitely true that some of
those hackers and film fit into the

116
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,589
stereotype but when we started this
research I was really expecting that

117
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:30,970
they were going to adhere to it a little
bit more i thought that that's where the

118
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:37,240
stereotype came from so if it didn't
come from film where did they come from

119
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,250
is a serious i was likely grew out of a
mishmash of understand misunderstood

120
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,600
nerd culture from somewhat closer
academia and the scientists and

121
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,769
engineers who are some of the first to
use computer technology wisely and also

122
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:53,410
to the hardcore gamers bent on BTW

123
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:59,170
the latest conquest or boss ok but one
thing is for sure that Hollywood is not

124
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,490
the source of the perpetuation of this
myth or the stereotype though it's

125
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:09,250
certainly guilty of creating some Sal we
shall we say amped-up visualizations

126
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:18,129
that do not accurately portray exploits
in a more realistic sense their little

127
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:21,730
bit more flashy than real exploits to
say the least

128
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,050
we see those in the hack in conclusion
of the hackers movie

129
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:30,879
Hugh Jackman's cubes and swordfish and
countless other films and shows

130
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,250
historically realistically exploits
aren't exciting to the average Joe views

131
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,000
viewer because they simply don't
understand what's happening and what's

132
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,399
up and why what reasons

133
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,240
Hollywood has tended us to create an
amped-up visualizations for the perfect

134
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,680
of dramatic effect

135
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,258
no more different than a police car
chases in favorite site heist movies

136
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,949
okay but that's true across a variety of
different industries as you just

137
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,370
mentioned with the heights I mean how
many times have we seen a bank robbery

138
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,410
in a film when in reality the amount of
times the bank has been robbed with a

139
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,910
dramatic shootout are something you
could count on one hand in the history

140
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,899
of our country

141
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:17,170
um what's of concern is this overarching
across-the-board characterization of

142
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:24,729
hackers as this all-powerful unbeatable
techno wizard with seemingly limitless

143
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,620
amounts of power

144
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,519
have you ever heard that old saying that
locks only keep honest people out

145
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:35,680
ok so guess what your average Joe user
that's what they think about your

146
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,060
security protocols because they

147
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,770
you're up against this guy and
particularly considering the majority of

148
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:50,290
Americans that are living today reached
adulthood without ever having any

149
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,459
contact with anything like what we
consider to be a modern personal

150
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,480
computer

151
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,820
I mean maybe they used a graphing
calculator or a slide rule or an ATM but

152
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,030
nothing like the laptop that i'm using
right now or my smartphone i mean

153
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,400
remember we went to the moon with a
computer that had a less sophisticated

154
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:18,069
system than the smartphone that is in
your pocket right now and the average

155
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,180
user doesn't have much more
understanding of the inner workings of

156
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,040
how that technology works or how to
control it then they do a witch or

157
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:34,810
wizard or a dragon so what does that
mean as a blue team information security

158
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,739
professionals we must experience a
tremendous amount of frustration from

159
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,330
users not following protocol particular
because their experience with hacking is

160
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,930
limited to what they see in their
screens that that we basically feed them

161
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,130
and has digested by the press and the
Hollywood the press tells them that

162
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,720
hackers are responsible for all kinds of
crime even though it's not necessarily

163
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,620
an accurate labeling sarah palin's email
getting hacked

164
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,750
ok this guy did not get into sarah
palin's email because of his amazing

165
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,400
technological powers

166
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,569
um you know not to overstate my
intelligence but I could do the kind of

167
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,870
research that this guy did and I'm not
an information technology security

168
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:20,290
professional he got in by using
Wikipedia to look up the answers to her

169
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,579
security questions i'm not saying that
that's not still dishonest but it's

170
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,890
nothing like an all-powerful
technological wizard with limitless

171
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:35,800
power who can hack no matter what you do
that they saw on TV and average Joe user

172
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,520
could thwart an attack like this by
simply choosing a more difficult to

173
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,020
obtain and tell that dude they do not
release on the security questions or

174
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,250
generate fictitious information that
they put for their security questions

175
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,710
what is the press do it they partially
due to create clickbait hysteria for the

176
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,120
equivalent of selling newspapers looking
for the next link in reading the the

177
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,900
refresh on the screen but probably at
least partially because the same

178
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,770
legitimate lack of understanding that
plagues their readers they need to dumb

179
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:11,350
it down to the fifth-grade reading level
the hacking stereotype the techno wizard

180
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:16,510
is just more than irritating campy and
accurate and it creates a culture which

181
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,770
undermines the authority of the blue
team community making it more easily for

182
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:27,760
public to fall prey to security threats
after all if the evil haxorus can

183
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,630
compromise your computer after 30
seconds of pounding on a keyboard

184
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:38,080
no matter what you do what is the point
of following security protocol and these

185
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,110
average so users who have bought into
this myth that they are powerless

186
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:50,170
against hackers they are not just the
corporate environment users who make our

187
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,540
blue team ursday today cleanup duties a
busy work living hell

188
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:02,260
they're your lawmakers and they are busy
compromising national security and

189
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,730
making overly vague laws without a
significant understanding of real life

190
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:11,920
hacking in an age where it's so much
more with an age where so much more

191
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,240
under threat because it's not the state
anymore it's our personal information or

192
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,620
financial assets are cars or energy
distributions are critical

193
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,540
infrastructure and our state secrets
different hackers a nation states have

194
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,829
never been more dangerous or the
information more valuable or more

195
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:38,380
powerful as an industry so what's the
point the point is the next time you

196
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,960
grumble about hacker stereotypes I want
you to think about this talk and I want

197
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,400
you to remember that I know that this
one is insulting

198
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,939
it hurts your feelings it hurts your ego
but this one

199
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:03,118
this one is much much more damaging in
terms of how it is shaping the world

200
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:10,709
that we live in and the legal climate
which will prosecute cyber crimes in the

201
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:20,459
future thank you questions any message
on

202
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,469
I don't know if everybody can hear
Charles James I don't know if everybody

203
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,630
can hear James I knew it was a British
king

204
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:56,399
I don't everybody in here James but the
question that James just asked was isn't

205
00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:00,330
the infosec community part of the
problem because when we see a major hack

206
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,480
happen a lot of the things that we see
happen over and over again in the news

207
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,559
is that beeping big companies were
compromised using like basic stuff that

208
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:13,320
we all know so comfy got hacked and what
happened was maybe that they had a bunch

209
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,439
of default passwords and hoops hackers
got in

210
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:25,320
honestly I think that it lies down to it
at all but a disconnect between our blue

211
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:32,700
team or just our IT departments and the
aight guarantee security side you know

212
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,500
we have we come here to conferences but
there are you know hundreds of thousands

213
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,950
of other professionals that are not here
they're not continuing to try to learn

214
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,330
about best practices and how to improve
how to make small measurable changes the

215
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,059
last training that they were kind of
involved when was when they went from

216
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:53,639
novell to active directory in two
thousand there they are not following

217
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:57,600
you know removing different ciphers and
and cleanup passwords and checking for

218
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,699
common hashes you're so mean

219
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,710
so I think the short answer is yes I
mean absolutely the community can def

220
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,020
we improve and be smarter and be better
and be more diligent but as long as your

221
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,610
average Joe user believes that no matter
what they do they're gonna get hacked

222
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,418
as long as they have this this belief in
their own paralysis

223
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,929
it's not that they aren't scared of
threats it's not that they are capable

224
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:26,970
of figuring out like hey maybe i should
use answer security questions that

225
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,230
aren't available widely on wikipedia
it's not that they can't figure that out

226
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,460
it's that they're still paralyzed by
their own fear of hackers that they

227
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,350
can't they can't take that step

228
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,740
it's not something that they feel like
they can't even protect against so the

229
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,510
escalade that to Horry change that to a
home invasion or something of that

230
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,679
nature they may put minor protections in
place but today every time make sure

231
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,190
that they put their car in the drive and
in lakhs only keep honest people out in

232
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,330
there in the garage so people don't want
her driving by are aware that their home

233
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,168
or not home such as your question James
thank you

234
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:19,020
yes he just made the comment that the
many of the techniques that we're

235
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,470
learning out in these hallways at this
conference will only keep honest people

236
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:28,470
out and the true black hat hackers have
access to technology and strategies that

237
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:33,809
are above our capability of defending
against I think that's what you said

238
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:40,470
when I think our defense ability does
directly depends on the capabilities of

239
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,260
the blue team side and yeah there are we
we are in a global world so you can face

240
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,789
people with extreme talent on the far
end of the spectrum but most case we are

241
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:55,470
not the people in this room are not
techno Wizards we just have diligence

242
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,750
and are willing to look for flaws and
system but for the most part the evil

243
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,559
acts towards in cyberspace are not
technical lizards either even though

244
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,559
that's totally what i saw in the movie
swordfish

245
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,439
monitoring they're not dogs cracked

246
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:21,129
yes their gods in the mythology but only
in the mythology it's a legend

247
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,600
yes well i think the other problem on
the other side of the spectrum is that

248
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,299
there are large companies that
perpetuate this but it is marketing

249
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:37,480
technique to get in and then that's
verging on the other end all day I talk

250
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,629
to these security guys I thought this
company in red is so over whoa you know

251
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:47,799
if you eventually his comment was that
many large corporations who are trying

252
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:53,620
to sell snake-oil solutions prey upon
this public belief in this stereotype

253
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,820
for the purpose of making money and
you're absolutely right they do it for

254
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,279
the same reason that that the press does
it

255
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:04,389
the press is trying to sell newspapers
and oh yeah their job is kind of to

256
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:10,269
inform us this day and age we demand
that they entertain us as well and one

257
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:15,129
of the things that we find most
entertaining is being frightened even

258
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:21,250
when you know some of that fright is not
correctly directed or is not based on

259
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,889
totally factual information properly
attributed their properly attributed um

260
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:30,250
you know that's exactly what that's
exactly the sort of thing you're looking

261
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,179
at there so that's a very astute
parallel yes you're absolutely right

262
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:47,710
anyone else yet go ahead so true he was
just talking about a comparison between

263
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:53,620
lead actors lead characters protagonist
or antagonist so villains or heroes vs.

264
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,428
there either the team around them or the
people are hacking against i think a

265
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,179
really good example of that is the movie
sneakers if this had been a longer talk

266
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,960
we definitely would have profile the
entire team such a dynamic cast of

267
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,870
characters really really interesting
characterizations to look at their a the

268
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,959
movie hackers actually would've been a
really good one to do multiple character

269
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,559
profiles profiles as well I think
there's a lot of really interesting

270
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,440
culture there in the movie sneakers

271
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,210
um Martin bar

272
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:29,020
I smart Marty bishops team I wouldn't
have scored as high on the bar graph

273
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:34,870
matrix as he would have at in terms of
beating a hacker stereotype Marty Bishop

274
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,280
does very very well versus I'm
struggling here dan Aykroyd character

275
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,990
don't call the character named well but
i mean he he discusses how his wife left

276
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:50,020
him because he was playing too much
computer hacker stuff there's also River

277
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:55,000
Phoenix's character whose social skills
are so lousy as cute as he is his social

278
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,440
skills are so lousy that when he has the
opportunity to make a demand everybody

279
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,240
else is making outrageous demands he
demands a cute girls phone number

280
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,320
because apparently this is the only
opportunity he's going to have to get

281
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,320
one that's that's sad

282
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:15,010
she was pretty hot I mean she's
definitely cute

283
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:20,230
any other questions thank you so much
for your indulgence we appreciate it
