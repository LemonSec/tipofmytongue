1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
alright guys welcome to get started down

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,349
thanks for coming my name is making
money to get off on by acting 101 or as

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,030
i like to call maintaining a healthy
lifestyle as a more road warrior before

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,210
i get into that a little bit of
background about myself and where I am I

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,119
his name is that I'm service in a woman
architect with office contact

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,970
information here if you'd like to
contact in the future

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,329
Oh presenting at the end but a little
bit about myself

8
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:40,079
besides what I actually do for a living
is that I was I starting line initially

9
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,960
in bringing order soon as I got out of
high school I was very active person and

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,010
I maintaining the what I consider my
best title ever isn't going to happen

11
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,610
that's pretty much the coolest toilet
ever actually have had before so this

12
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,879
made it out hacking for the record

13
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,640
still no besides being behind the
keyboard actually have to wake up at

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,799
five in the morning he forced to run
like they're screaming at me like that

15
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,900
so i was very active if you can imagine
very stressed out and I could be

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,750
enjoying pretty much anything I want to
write so as I as I left the record i

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,820
went into a job that was doing instant
response and pretty much if you are done

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,490
in two responses anyone have done put is
anyone out there a fire before so this

19
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,850
is pretty much my life everything was
falling

20
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,199
everything's going ok i'm eating the
same way I used to and I'm still doing

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,930
everything I have done before and was
you know talking on a little bit of

22
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,740
weight right so I'm still be an active i
gave crossfit I did great lifting

23
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,250
everything I did before

24
00:01:51,250 --> 00:02:00,039
past I moved on even more sedentary
lifestyle i became an investor i really

25
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:11,980
love all my kids this is a nice pleasant
so I I didn't emigration Justin which is

26
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,470
even worse phrase I think you say to
people don't understand happy so I'm

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:25,030
gonna try things but anyways I I i
started packing on some of the parents i

28
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,040
just it just happens over a progression
timeline right i started growing it out

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,400
you know it little brisley anyways some
of the things i mentioned before some of

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,060
my heart problems I had with this is
that my background with all the stuff is

31
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,730
that I was used to a certain lifestyle
that I had my mind set and I just kept

32
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,590
with myself right and that including
very large portion sizes so including

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,500
when I wait on gigs i would get the
extreme size robot right I if I ever

34
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,100
make it out the texas and i think it's
El Paso with the Texan I'm gonna get

35
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:10,930
that something to on state and yet and
yet but this is pretty much the state I

36
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,480
would normally eat everyday and it just
on some bacon on top of that great i

37
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,540
also was used to be in the report and

38
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,970
like a so still over he's got a lot of
hands

39
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,619
I was also saying a little bit too late
just being a dickhead on the internet so

40
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:48,700
popular smirnoff ice w great they're not
always like that anyways I was basically

41
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:55,660
doing all the things i guess in this
mindset now all right I was not being

42
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,190
added to it being mindful and the
biggest why i think that i had with

43
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:12,489
myself is that I was right I was so
s-m-r-t right I knew everything I do

44
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,510
everything but there was so much
conflicting information coming from all

45
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:22,539
sorts of sources right there was things
telling me to do failure low-carbon Leo

46
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,470
and stuff like that and if anyone does
these guys i'm talking about i'm not

47
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,910
trying to downsize them all but I just
had all these things and i tried to make

48
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,320
myself I try to make a secret scroll
program basically around i try to be

49
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,310
smarter than people ever tell me to do
XYZ because all those things will

50
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,260
actually work if you do them you have to
be mindful about what it is that you're

51
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,180
actually doing which the biggest
takeaway from this thing is Lord desert

52
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,370
you have to actually make it work for
you so I was you know I was tossed it

53
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,330
wasn't here 0 when they're like to run

54
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:06,969
fucking1 running a lot you know bring 40
run as far as you can die basically but

55
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,410
what I have to realize is that there is
actually nothing revolutionary about

56
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:19,539
science RT there's the revolutionary
about fitness or e right we are we all

57
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:24,280
need to live so everything at this point
is just evolution we take the basics and

58
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,750
then we

59
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,200
expand upon right so visual image stone
the hallway to remember being that the

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,760
world is gonna get better

61
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,650
great there's basics that we actually
have to hear to also one of the things

62
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,830
that got me a little bit was cold
dieting I got a rod tip and to certain

63
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,289
things and start drinking and I say old
dying because there is no single best

64
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,060
diet out there in my honest opinion
however if you log onto the internet

65
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:03,090
went on there are a plethora of people
that will tell you planes rights of

66
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:11,609
vegans to lo-har people a low-carb Elio
quito active sites they are right and

67
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,830
you were wrong and then we'll let you
know

68
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,479
extremely how you're involved and the
company comes an emotional responses and

69
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,100
I kind of want to take away like step
away from emotion of it and try to get

70
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,260
into more of a rational thought process
process about that so the truth is that

71
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,599
most people breathe away from socially
normal standards are typically under the

72
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,310
assumption that there they're making a
rational choice rate their their uh

73
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,250
their movements are influenced by your
news feed our or cultural bias of holes

74
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:52,530
so if you're presented with information
which an argument which favors your way

75
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:58,799
you're bringing this argument right you
make a totally rational decision to

76
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,850
follow the diet that picture is right
just kind of like the quote that there's

77
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:08,580
no there's no journalist that is unwise
except the one that that grease in the

78
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:16,710
time so you you you only influence your
own mind straight which was what I was

79
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:26,820
falling into all the time but it might
mean it's a trap and my opinion except

80
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
for there is no best diet out there

81
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:39,210
so on devices here i mentioned before
that your diet your bias and identity

82
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:45,989
will determine what that gives us it's
pretty universal pattern for most people

83
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,840
to reinforce what you believe yourself
your own myself it's really hard to make

84
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,130
a switch about what you are having any
not right if you if you believe

85
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,760
something whether it's you know
political opinion it's really hard my

86
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,930
people hurt seriously i have to admit
that i was actually walking at some

87
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:14,790
points which I never wall place we're
sure that it was younger so like I said

88
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:20,670
admitting a mistake and just racing
months or years following the trend is

89
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,590
really hard for most pose so there are
many contradicting voices out there and

90
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,940
if you're around there and believe you
can agree with that there's an

91
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:36,599
information overload is basically the
EOS of fitness and diet out there for

92
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,440
yourself there's so much information
coming at you you can actually process

93
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,650
what you need to actually do that makes
sense

94
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:51,750
computer terminal so with with that
there's also the problem of superfoods

95
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:58,740
bait studies and but fear uncertainty
and doubt right we are overly

96
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,890
exaggerated or irrational i would say
exaggerated benefits of our favorite

97
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,189
foods right we're seeing these studies
pop up all the time

98
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,710
drink tequila will be waiting line of
these pilots have helped me lose weight

99
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,700
right we take that information confirms
our bias and then we go about our

100
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,540
business day today because we saw this
thing on BuzzFeed or copper right there

101
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:31,709
was a study that is straight box from is
that this your watch up Adam ruins Adam

102
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,339
ruins ever

103
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:38,249
thing they have studied with chocolate
and he tricked the news media into

104
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:42,389
promoting the study basically about how
chocolate help you lose weight

105
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,540
it was totally fake study everything was
fabricated and he got published got

106
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,540
published study on some fake site that
just basically was paper plate and trick

107
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,469
the news media into actually promoting
this across the board and probably heard

108
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,110
a lot of people and what did a 2-1 true
that there was a bias and up in the

109
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,240
media but in other words you got to be
mindful of what you believe inside of

110
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,680
these studies that come out right so
there are studies that come out and just

111
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,680
gonna be mindful of your lies before i
start around along too much

112
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:27,660
we're also a society of that's fixating
were fixated on taking pill to solve our

113
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,439
bills

114
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:37,319
thank you Dr Seuss guess right we're
looking for quick fixes and easy house

115
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:43,469
right we I used to be that way so by
hydroxycut on the regular just going

116
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,029
down right i want to lose weight fast
one just how long is it now don't want

117
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,740
to treat for you

118
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,610
a year from that one was it right now so
we're looking for easy outs and that's

119
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,600
one thing you gotta be my delicious to
go ahead and get rid of that it's a slow

120
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,480
and steady process and we'll get to that
in a minute

121
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,040
we also have a problem in our community
with a sedentary lifestyle

122
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:12,059
I'll be sitting from our computer pretty
much all day at least upon my facebook

123
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:17,279
so Twitter your Facebook feed so we're
in front of a computer pretty much all

124
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,540
the time not only in front of a computer
but I got had my it my personal heater

125
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,160
might my pocket so we're basically
hunched over all the time not doing much

126
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:35,910
we grew up we may God people grew up
working for me actually hunting then we

127
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:41,519
can full of agricultural society we went
to the Industrial Revolution and now

128
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,020
we're basically just enough

129
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:49,170
college and doing nothing right we're
watching TV so this really is the effect

130
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:57,810
and what I want to make sure you take
away from this is that sorry

131
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,930
according to a research job sorry

132
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:08,430
you take that back this is really good
pounds the effect there there if you all

133
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,560
the city and takeaway for any activity
you've done such as running water so

134
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,770
there's a rica study by runners world
set according to a research from the

135
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:26,100
University of Texas said every unit of
time it cancels out eight percent of the

136
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,000
game from the same amount of running so
in other words if you run for an hour in

137
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,720
the morning or in time it's going to go
ahead and cancel out

138
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,010
eighty percent of sitting down for 10
hours so everything out of time

139
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:43,680
cancel that eighty percent so that makes
your understanding of which are 58 years

140
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,760
older of your caloric intake is yourself
quickly more seeing more important

141
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,410
reaching your goals will get it actually
hear about what we actually need you to

142
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,569
do that so what I guess I want you to
take away from this kind of a blogger

143
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,620
seven is don't volunteer the travel of
what i used to do is that I worked out

144
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,820
really hard today

145
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,220
i SAT basically for 10 hours at my job
and after over two hours in the car or

146
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,960
let's say to pull our so i just i sat
down and then I worked out for an hour

147
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,270
getting a prospect or whatever and I was
like yeah onion weeks

148
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:27,210
hell yeah I deserve this right yeah so
don't want to travel that not seeing it

149
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,950
undermines our battering or specific to
emotional response but on just be

150
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,630
mindful of that what you're actually
doing to benefit your home can be

151
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,200
getting very quickly by just being said
so it's on to how actually fix this

152
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,420
problem

153
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,910
there's a question out of our system
just hanging out that that more

154
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,010
sedentary or being critical unhealthy is
an active choice of they're doing right

155
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:07,329
but is it actually is it actually an
unhealthy choices right so random bc

156
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:10,959
come to my friend Alice rapid obesity
and unhealthy lifestyles are often say

157
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,029
to be self-destructive choice I would
waiter that is a mistake to presume

158
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:21,399
these are choices and not an action
which becomes action so taking control

159
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,750
once held is a choice right you make a
choice actually involved in your own

160
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,160
self and pay attention to what you're
doing and how much drinking and I want

161
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,810
you working out walking the default is
to not do that

162
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,620
so being hyper aware of our own
lifestyle choices is pretty much a

163
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,269
luxury that a lot of people don't
actually have or even if they don't have

164
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:46,480
it they don't understand they don't have
to quote tolerance of the unknown

165
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,209
unknowns so in the absence of sufficient
information which requires one time

166
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:59,619
money and education you cannot a
recognized that a choice exists and

167
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:06,310
determine what a better choice is and
see having confidence to follow through

168
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,029
and through all this choice otherwise
the default it's not consider your daily

169
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,829
food choices so the question agree or
disagree they read all the screen that

170
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:20,920
is it's not active choice to actually II
portable healthy whatever that means but

171
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,140
rather a lack of awareness is there any
way is a choice on here that's for my

172
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:32,680
friend beyond that says you don't you
don't know what you don't know can't

173
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,279
really change what we need to change
right

174
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:41,620
that leads me to where I can fix my
problem here

175
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,350
I clearly real point here where I needed
to actually stop self sabotaging myself

176
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,870
by program hopping or making my own
secret programs of diets and southern I

177
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,510
thought alice is smart about workout
programs where

178
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:03,980
I have to admit to myself that my diet
fitness research up until this point and

179
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,710
let me to less than expected results
follow you know like you know dressing

180
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,460
up as you know kingly nice for halloween
or something with six pack abs like I

181
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,750
have so I was never going to be just .
just bought my celebrate or so the

182
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,970
student so i need to actually seek
expert advice i actually need to have

183
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:29,600
souls and that's pretty much if how many
people in your reference holds many

184
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,600
people get tired to give their expert
advice on things

185
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:41,420
yeah so I did this stop and hire
somebody that knew more than so i need

186
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,569
to be less s-m-r-t smart fire somebody
else so some of the things that are

187
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:55,400
hiring told me for some basic lessons
and math basically i mentioned before

188
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,050
Michael teachers talk on the biggest
thing that I would like to take away

189
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:07,129
today is that calories actually matter
and your lifestyle is specifically what

190
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:14,329
you're taking right now obviously what
you're doing to to expand calories so if

191
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,310
you want to be sedentary if you don't
want to change anything that you're

192
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,669
doing don't work out you don't look wait
you don't run like that I hate running i

193
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:24,079
do it and I fall down a lot just from
ankle so I hate doing all those things

194
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,159
so you don't want to do any of those
things if you just want to do a minimum

195
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,840
you can go ahead and just pay attention
to what you're taking their so these are

196
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,720
some basic things that we see all the
time

197
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:41,870
what matters in life or with your health
and fitness college how much

198
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,760
specifically inside of the calories
which I don't want too much into it here

199
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,360
into it a little later but your macro
breakdown

200
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:57,070
bros before if it fits your macros that
so do we know what a macro is just short

201
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:07,240
yeah good neighborhood

202
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:15,640
you're all broken up our bags and purses
might like white 12 something so

203
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,950
backwards short for macro nutrient here
and what I mean by that is the protein

204
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,720
carbs and fat that you can take every
day whether it be sugar out of a soda or

205
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,900
protein out of a piece of states that
fat which is in United States not

206
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,940
leaving States ribbon got marbling
something that side of it all those

207
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,860
things have calories that hope you stay
alive and it's never good to die bro

208
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:56,409
right so I haven't died once yet I've
heard his office of my friend jeremy is

209
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:04,690
that a dog sleeping snoring ah so i'm
going to go to sleep you're my friend

210
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,740
Ron wolf whose if you if you know
anything about the lead is pretty things

211
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,720
with that he was recommended I've heard
and saw it many times to sleep as much

212
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:22,000
as you can to not get fired and not get
divorce so basically as much a general

213
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
recommendation right so 10,000 foot /
have you you know with me it was bad

214
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,330
before middle i consider that like early
very early so i tried to try to get as

215
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,720
much as I can and still wake up at seven
in the morning right

216
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:44,530
I also pay attention to is watering take
your hydration so generally recommended

217
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,190
is that you you take your body weight
where you are currently and you take

218
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,020
half of that bounces is what you want is
a minute

219
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:57,920
daily for today and for doing any sort
of exercise every hour of exercise add

220
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:04,610
14 ounces that so for a 200-pound about
two containers of like that now I drink

221
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,080
about a gallon day that's a hundred and
twenty ounces in a gallon so it's

222
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,149
probably like halfway

223
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,740
go ahead normal again yes so your
desired weight half the things i'm not

224
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,480
your desire your actual body weight now
and so a lot of people tell you to drink

225
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,110
a gallon day no matter what but
obviously I don't minimum take your

226
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,850
finger body weight divided in half and
that's how many houses you want to live

227
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:35,030
every day right and then if you're doing
any sort of activity at 30 ounces of

228
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:39,320
that for every hour of cardiovascular
lifting weights like that you're going

229
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:47,480
to sweat i'm sweating right now so that
last one stress of the job feel a little

230
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,250
bit right now this is kind of subjective
for everybody right everyone sort of

231
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,360
manage stress it's going to come down to
find things that you like to do and try

232
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,639
to fix whatever it is that makes you
trust whatever is it you can fix so try

233
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,790
to leave in distress to the best of your
ability as i know it's a very generic

234
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:11,540
thing but it is what it is is here just
it's it's all personal to you is I have

235
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:17,090
no context of how everyone else feels
right i can only try to sympathize with

236
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:25,070
other than I to learn is to change my
mindset here you can have the best

237
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:31,460
training and nutrition coaching on a man
but if you don't trust trusted and apply

238
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,430
it it's going to be right you can hire
the best pin tester the world and have

239
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,940
them have all the things in your network
if you don't actually do the things that

240
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,630
they tell you to do the picture network
it's not going to actually be able to

241
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,620
its have no impact you're going to get
going soon right

242
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,689
so you have to trust the process follow
the instructions bullying

243
00:21:54,310 --> 00:22:00,190
trusted expert when remember that you
are the customer you are now the

244
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,090
customer to whether it is higher than
Sultan's or you're doing this on her own

245
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:08,379
you have to actually apply whatever
formula that you're given

246
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,100
so you doing something own i'll give you
a simple formula later if you do this on

247
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,610
your own visited believe in that
actually call it you can't be

248
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:21,040
discouraged along the way right if you
apply the process trusted it will work

249
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,100
for you

250
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,800
I guess I kind of skipped out on my
background a little bit i was about 60

251
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,430
pounds heavier before for right now and
took me about a year to lose all of me i

252
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:42,190
know some people can do it quicker I get
slow methodical and that's all you but I

253
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,650
had to invest and trusted my trainer
that I was paying money to actually get

254
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:53,980
the results of those seeking so most of
us felt with customers not accepting her

255
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,530
advice on security right we were
choosing the availability hacked and

256
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:04,660
this is not unique to you just then so
we have a customer now we have to trust

257
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:12,310
the experts follow processes so we have
to we have to change our minds and our

258
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,710
environment to set up for success

259
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:21,310
this takes a lot of mental wiring for
most people changing habits nailing the

260
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:27,070
basics and finding three habits probably
that will help you see I say 3 is just a

261
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:32,919
basic word out there will probably be a
general Petrov so one if you're

262
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:39,670
sedentary start walking daily for
joining that will help you at least take

263
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:44,020
off that monitor whether it's you want
to start working out where you just want

264
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,940
to start walking every spot just find
one have it and stick to it for that

265
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,490
category second one so like if thats
exactly to go out to eat every day for

266
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:59,740
lunch and dinner which I routinely did
start brown back into work or start

267
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,970
cooking for yourself

268
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,500
not every

269
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:09,160
Melanie coke has to be a culinary
masterpiece happy Top Chef worthy i have

270
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,960
had lots of just mustard chicken
sandwiches before just because I'm

271
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,220
hungry and I needed to go you know and
I've also had poptarts are popular and

272
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,090
stuff on the way but I know how to make
those things because I actually learned

273
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,620
how to actually make them and took the
time and I know what's actually going

274
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:33,669
into this so on the third cat like for
example 14 drinking often which I don't

275
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:40,510
see anybody with here's my system
bringing on as we often do here drink

276
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:48,040
all the booze right which is you know
kind of a this much snow we can try to

277
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,899
start reducing that intake so if if
you're a person that drinks every day

278
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,870
seven days a week you go out all the
time like I used to do when I was number

279
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:01,239
four start by trying to eliminate how
much you drink every night because if

280
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,260
you if you tell someone stopped drinking
entirely or someone that will eliminate

281
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,980
everything like i mentioned before you
try to tell someone eliminate things

282
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,540
that may stick to it for like two weeks
or maybe like a 30 day challenge but

283
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,860
we're going to fall back those habits
very quickly afterwards so to start

284
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,240
trying to make psychological impacts
your own self and make it a lifestyle

285
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,740
choice if you're more informed about
you're more likely to stick to it that

286
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:32,530
makes sense so don't try to go all out
on some of these things just try to make

287
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:40,570
three habits that can help you stick
your goals so some of the fundamentals

288
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:47,290
of nutrition for fat loss for Florida's
it flexibility and making your own food

289
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:54,760
again the biggest takeaway here is Laura
deficit it has has to be a priority if

290
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,260
you're going to lose weight you have to
intake less than spend

291
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,640
let's go you got to make time for
yourself learning to juggle these things

292
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,150
I know there's a lot of stress like a
lot of deadlines something that you have

293
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,180
to make time for yourself and actually
be able to apply to yourself is if you

294
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,790
die bro you're gonna it's not gonna be
good right so doesn't make time for

295
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,810
yourself and be kind of flexible with
this and more importantly I guess what

296
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:31,290
that was like dying is no one choice 'as
i will support your goals whether that

297
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,760
be no weight lifting her what happened
running marathons what are your career

298
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,000
goals are will determine that so you
have to also learn to make your own food

299
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
doesn't mention it doesn't have to be a
culinary masterpiece

300
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:48,510
there has to be some flexibility right
as i mentioned more cover compromise is

301
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:55,379
necessary 0 under the terms of the
fidelis the Marine Corps always faithful

302
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,660
this is going to play off that it's
simple Gunny always flexible Tom

303
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:06,780
bodybuilders physique competitors
fitness professionals so often tell you

304
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:12,000
that you absolutely have to weigh
everything to get to reach what you're

305
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,910
doing right and that's that's because
that's their goal they want to be you

306
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,890
know they want to be on stage traded and
whatever so they have to be that results

307
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,600
but for the average Joe Blow we kind of
just want to look good in the mirror

308
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:36,060
great or naked because great business
people are you know we really don't have

309
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:41,550
that luxury do that so there's going to
be some sort of flexibility between

310
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:49,980
precision and you know reality so
there's often a phrase to with

311
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,150
moderation

312
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:58,710
it's a very subjective term for most
people it's often very often most like

313
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:04,560
likely a lesson think it's right so
people also say yeah

314
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,810
Miller know about this isn't grab this
those things everything in moderation

315
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,790
sometimes can usually take you off your
trap to actually reach

316
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,139
goals so just be mindful that might say
any food is actually bad into that

317
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:25,080
there's no bad foods out there my
opinion but being informed about what's

318
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,429
inside the food that makes the food up
right at the MapReduce your breakout

319
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:34,170
caloric intake of food will allow you to
know what what that that indulgence

320
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:38,610
actually looks like great and how it
actually applies to your goals whatever

321
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,560
that may be

322
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:46,230
ah little thing I am careful of is to
make sure that activity adjustments such

323
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,400
as myfitnesspal and like if it's
something that with weight loss tech

324
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,840
that I wasn't trusting it too much if
you go on my fitness stuff which I

325
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,790
actually really love that part

326
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:01,889
he will say are you secretary or you
halfway active and multiplied you know

327
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:06,870
me myself I was like that we know today
I'm have to person but I'm not a

328
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,070
lumberjack

329
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,080
I'm not sitting on the computer all day
long so my estimation on what actually

330
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,520
an active person is pretty flawed based
on bias so just be mindful of the

331
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,110
activity adjustments basically how many
colors are expending on your day-to-day

332
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,879
basis just to be alive

333
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:31,890
ah how it fits into your goal Tom users
often underestimate and I products often

334
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:37,170
overestimate which can lead to no
results at best and weight gain any

335
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:46,140
worse so just fire be where you just be
mindful that there was a study recently

336
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:54,060
among young adults they did actually
have a weight loss and they did a PET

337
00:29:54,060 --> 00:30:00,179
scans to as well up with a group of
people for 24 months to years people

338
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,320
have more technology devices they lost
less weeks and the people that just

339
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,110
basically made the same changes to the
plan to use it didn't use the technology

340
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:14,178
so I don't you see that with wearing a
Fitbit make you gain weight recently but

341
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:20,120
basically a mighty way that study is
that you you look at it when you get

342
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,189
like I go around on the treadmill says I
lost in the calories and my goal is two

343
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:31,250
thousand dollars or something crazy like
that if i if I'm like okay yeah i'm

344
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,500
rolling in taste 2000 today and I've
lost from running I could eat this extra

345
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,210
donut or you know this license or
whenever you love you know and that just

346
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:45,620
being trustworthy because it's basically
just a rough very rough estimation Judy

347
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:55,850
I think too like fifty percent and after
just being yourself is inaccurate hard

348
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:06,918
as an alternative to 10 so i love my
fitness pal right so but what I'm saying

349
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:12,049
here is like when you when you say like
I'm an active person on that thing I

350
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:17,480
would recommend just saying sedentary
and just or I have a formula here later

351
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,370
to actually like kind of go over what
you should intake and again i'm not a

352
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,149
dietitian on a doctor so it's not
medical advice but it's just a general

353
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,559
guideline what what should lead and is
generally acceptable from

354
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:37,160
recommendations I've seen from lots of
that works but we have just fired

355
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,160
wherewithal those things that make sense

356
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:48,500
i also had some realistic expectations
here are we on see you like a lot of

357
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:57,380
diets that that encourage starving
yourselves i don't like name certain

358
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,910
names with some of these life there hypo
floor meeting like you know basically

359
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:06,710
started yourself like five hundred
dollars a day maybe 700 like that for a

360
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:16,250
male or you know a thousand fourteen
else like that very very very well uh we

361
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:24,170
really want to do that it's it's very
slow and steady process there's a

362
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:29,480
difference between fat loss and weight
loss and a lot of people are very caught

363
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:37,940
up with your skin that makes sense
though the numbers on the scale that

364
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,830
loss is a slow and steady process you
need to trust that process and should be

365
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,639
fast so the most extreme weight loss
programs will show you results on the

366
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,470
scale but most likely will be water
weight and my muscle glycogen which will

367
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:57,470
come back later when we start repeating
yourself there's a difference in fact we

368
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:02,930
lost we're looking to actually burn fat
right for losing weight that's what my

369
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:07,640
concern was so I'm assuming you're in
here that's probably your concerns

370
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,320
we're losing looking to lose fat and not
actual muscle natural muscle masses

371
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,159
hard-earned and if you lose that weight
it's not going to come back very quickly

372
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:23,030
we want to keep all that mean body mass
so in a general recommendations about

373
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:31,850
realistically for fat loss is to be
about a pound to a pound half at most

374
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:38,929
two pounds a week so that doesn't look
very sexy on spoon or you know updating

375
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,130
your status saying are lost ten pounds
this week that's you know it's not very

376
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,660
sexy but realistically that's a slow and
steady and healthiest potential way to

377
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,910
go about it that what we talked about
500 calorie deficit for take 40 pounds

378
00:33:52,910 --> 00:34:01,250
of weight loss per week so that's about
3,500 calories and seven days i will

379
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,150
talk about how to determine that for you
shortly here there's also some feelings

380
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,500
of failure here that I want to mention
light will bring some curveballs you

381
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,418
know you need to be forgiving yourself
especially if it's around the holidays

382
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:19,580
derby con definitely know you can be
mindful of the things that you're

383
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,819
actually going to do like a needle in
your life it's not the most important

384
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,350
thing to always be attention

385
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:31,139
fitness and nutrition so let's go
through some curveballs go with it but

386
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,790
also be forgiving yourself . harming
yourself and then also be honest and

387
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:40,679
decent honest with yourself right just
made that okay yeah this is a vendor

388
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,469
weaken now get back on the horse right
so don't rush it trust the process

389
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:53,459
having the tourists in my hair right on
one thing i want to point out here is

390
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,190
like an initial weeks that you start if
you start on course you can lose a lot

391
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,840
of weight in the first two weeks and
you're seeing at results and then

392
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:09,420
actually going there's a panel following
is a pound the one related plateau and

393
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,100
losing all that weight up front and set
you up for discouragement later

394
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:19,020
just be mindful that is a slow and city
process top you're at some point you're

395
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:24,900
going to have to plot to readjust we're
actually doing you so on to some

396
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:32,100
technical are some math courses here we
have to find once your normal with the

397
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:39,750
baseline our intake want to go to the
concept of baselining right so I'm tell

398
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,950
students my security defense class that
you really can't understand what is

399
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,330
abnormal with anything without first
understanding what is normal

400
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:55,020
whether that's identified delicious
versus normal services on like what's

401
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,490
going on a computer or anomalies within
bandwidth utilization you first have to

402
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,819
have a baseline of information know
what's actually going on right so you

403
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,840
have to know what's normal in your
environment for yourself before you can

404
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:12,180
understand what you need to change about
myself so I go to anyone with a

405
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,390
background and process management
consulting are intimately aware of the

406
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:21,180
fact that were you close to change to a
process you need to understand what the

407
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,710
current intake is and where it's getting
them this more applicable to actually

408
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,880
follow the diet right you have to
understand what you're actually driving

409
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,770
are taking yourself everyday to
understand what's going on and where

410
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:40,300
to make a change for that so what that
looks like is what is your current

411
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,810
intake so initially we were starting to
need to actually start locking

412
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:48,670
everything for a week at least and see
what you're actually doing as I

413
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:53,230
mentioned before i was eating you know a
healthy that's a debatable term a

414
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:57,700
healthy diet for a long time and I knew
and everything once i start paying

415
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,770
attention to what I was actually in
taking all those steaks and bacon was a

416
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:07,990
lot of calories so once i started to do
the math behind all I started to know

417
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:15,459
ok this is where this is what's going on
right I was

418
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,730
yeah like i said i was surprised by
healthy i was so high calories it was

419
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:23,740
made me gain weight so we're yourself
daily off initially for that first week

420
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,410
preferably at the same time of day

421
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:32,680
first thing we were I wake up and maybe
post after if you want you know dude

422
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:38,049
so what we're going to see an average
overtime right so this is a week and

423
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:43,930
have a little bit of data set there if
we see an upward sick and wait there

424
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,950
we're going to know that maybe were
taking too many calories on a weekly

425
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,109
basis or a daily basis right

426
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,800
ah so we're not Florrick surplus there
so that means you can actually start

427
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,970
cutting down if we see that were
consistent consistent numbers throughout

428
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,899
the week we know that we're at a
baseline of mobiles we're going to

429
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,700
maintain where were pretty hat that's
fine with you or not that's fine but

430
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,600
that's where your baseline so the
baseline will tell you where to go from

431
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,259
there so it's just a simple math at this
point so we need to go ahead and start

432
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,260
changing summerhouse to lose weight

433
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,960
ah so I'm sorry the slide is a little
bit small

434
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,320
there's a lot of information on i'm
going to go through it slowly as

435
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,760
possible here on this is going to be
kind of foreign process to you if you're

436
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,340
not if you're not used to pay attention
for your team name right

437
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:42,730
are you cold for one if you don't want
to work out you don't want way your food

438
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,890
everyday don't do anything like that

439
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,049
my general recommendation is to go ahead

440
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:51,730
and you don't know half court position
go ahead and just started eating veggies

441
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:58,060
are vegetables everyday and serving four
servings of meets with your food

442
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,670
everyday least four times a day so what
this would look like for a woman will be

443
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:12,730
four times daily take a fist-sized
serving vets also pick your fist way to

444
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,910
look at it look at it if it was brought
to that size that fits size of

445
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:22,029
vegetables are Hall size survey we need
so everyone has a palm-sized about palm

446
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:32,950
size and we meet not that great with
precise that not a huge state a tough

447
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:38,950
hand surgery of carved its food such as
starches grains fruits with whatever you

448
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:44,319
would like a little bit of some sort of
carbohydrate besides vegetables and then

449
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,020
a thumb-sized your thumb

450
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:52,420
ah back and students and what I mean by
that dances like not succeeds if you

451
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,450
ever look at the floor and take some of
those things you'll be very surprised

452
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:01,270
myself in size of peanut butter is about
the jar sometimes and I've actually

453
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,970
weighed out if you're wonderful really
bad

454
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,959
go ahead to serving size and peanut
butter actually wait out here like jesus

455
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:16,090
i love peanut butter and apples and then
time it's my downfall but backwards so

456
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,290
yeah so thumbs is serving up some of
those foods and they're very floor again

457
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:24,529
so he was back to after again with men
it's basically the same

458
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:29,240
region to it just increases a little bit
based upon men generally being a little

459
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:34,729
bigger than women right that's a
generalization and could bear so if

460
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:38,510
you're just starting to do this and
start to see that you're not losing any

461
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:44,270
sort of weight gain your goals in weight
adjust these to be a little more stories

462
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,280
and I had a lot of here

463
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:52,070
nutrition is worried about this these
recommendations from there are very good

464
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:57,740
source of information for fitness
professionals something that so if you

465
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,029
want to go and check that out

466
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:07,490
go ahead if you would like to be a
little more precise and start to

467
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,339
actually if you made these changes we
want to go ahead and start the little

468
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:17,990
precise with the stuff we go ahead and
do that but we need to establish a 40

469
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,740
deficit right so I talked about before I
know where your normal as if you already

470
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,140
established in his life

471
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:30,140
you can go ahead and take that we've
already established a baseline long your

472
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:34,100
daily intake you know how to way to
measure food at this point or would you

473
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:40,670
know perhaps what's a serving of lean
meat looks like or you know not succeed

474
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,350
something that we go ahead and started
established our game attribution oregon

475
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:50,089
city or Florida anti-aging want to
actually get more precisely so this

476
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:56,060
formula here was given to me by my my
trainer and it is for somebody that's

477
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,170
active right so I mean they're doing
weight training about four to five times

478
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:04,940
a week and doing about three to four
hours of cardiovascular activity running

479
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,620
a walking what have you

480
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:11,299
so this formula here is for that if you
want to change that you're wanting any

481
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:20,240
changes to your are like a workout
everything takes one bite below a 10x10

482
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,339
so for this example we take our body
weight so for example of a 200-pound

483
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,270
person

484
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:30,890
I 200 pounds i want to lose some weight

485
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:37,100
I think that tonight well I had 24 2400
calories a day as my total calories I

486
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,990
want to take and I going to do a little
bit more math here so the first sentence

487
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:49,100
that here is take the total daily
calories set to find my . 3 we get equal

488
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:56,390
to hundred percent right so yeah . 3 143
a lot of the first ones . 3 we didn't

489
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:02,690
get an equation / 4 and then we get our
total grams of protein per day which is

490
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:09,500
a hundred grass verges developers which
roughly equates out to 720 calories and

491
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,410
at this point you might be asking
yourself if you're not familiar with

492
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:20,779
this out is why is it was in before nine
there that's because protein and carbs

493
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:26,780
each have four calories per gram and
that has nine program so this is a

494
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,980
little bit different question

495
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:35,090
so we get out with me and protein or
offered for the sense that 244 carbs and

496
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:42,470
any grants for fast as you can see in
grams of fat is basically the same as 80

497
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,669
grams of proteins it's over double the
amount so it's just one of those things

498
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:59,540
Michael good all 12 also i just don't
rub equation about where you are with

499
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,110
your body weight and it's just a
generalization so if it doesn't work for

500
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,650
you at this point so let's say you do x
well and you're not losing weight

501
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,960
go ahead and take that down by 11 or
their bite is just a very general broad

502
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:18,440
destination just from general guidelines
just stay with going

503
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,260
your body exactly up to

504
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:27,780
well not just a function but to actually
lose weight yeah exactly

505
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:32,339
all right I'm sorry

506
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,690
active yes for active and then if you
don't make any changes to your lifestyle

507
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:46,830
by 11 if that doesn't work for 12 rc10
recently separated 200 you the way that

508
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:54,750
you want whether you're so you want to
if you want to gain weight so yeah so my

509
00:44:54,750 --> 00:45:01,920
my knowledge based on this is more on
losing weight but uh yes so there are

510
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:09,270
some recommendations of how can you
comment let me help you up but yes so by

511
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:18,930
13 and writing or recording that 1i
think it's 14 are specifically address

512
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,589
for my trainer Josh drunk

513
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:29,070
this is just a very rough estimation
right so it but it over time and

514
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:34,470
throughout following other people it's
been shown to actually work so if you

515
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,549
would like more decision i would
recommend hiring you should hire the

516
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:44,430
consultant and have some have someone
that actually hold you accountable i

517
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,770
know that i had this in my life

518
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:53,009
someone to report you and you know maybe
maybe actually report into them you

519
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:58,110
don't basis like what i was doing and
how things are progressing go ahead but

520
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,110
it won't help

521
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:18,780
the question was if if your healthcare
provider dietitian have to die laughing

522
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:26,280
that i would recommend consulting
somebody that actually has expertise in

523
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:32,190
soon yeah so whether that's for free for
healthcare or if you go out to external

524
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:36,930
source online coaching is very big right
now and distant distant training is very

525
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:43,980
big so i would just see that that
alligator weather has provided free

526
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,330
I can't say to not listen to somebody
that's a health care professional is I'm

527
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:53,910
not a doctor so that means it's good so
his pen testers we might have

528
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:57,868
certifications or qualifications and
there's there's something similar to

529
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:02,070
that for fitness coaches yeah how do you
interview how do you find out the person

530
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,540
you're talking to it really does help

531
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:08,910
exactly so i would go off basically the
same way that we do with in our own in

532
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:15,149
our own questions right we have we have
these conferences we have people that we

533
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:19,859
trust i guess and we know people that
things that work against and I would go

534
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:24,029
up your recommendation but there are
certain certifications but just like

535
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:35,250
there are certifications with any
certifications almost did you know

536
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:41,220
caveat you know part where their little
bit but on dark gather it's very trigger

537
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:48,029
process but i would i would go with the
default of looking to a friend and see

538
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,830
with you know what works for them and
work with them then maybe work you know

539
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:56,730
that answer the question

540
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,080
yeah but there were definitely
certifications up and god put out there

541
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:08,910
forward this is a nutrition there on one
of the hard ones actually get certain i

542
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:11,680
think it's like the osep of nutrition

543
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:24,848
good i'm sorry you want to maintain the
way I'm so I guess you going the way you

544
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:26,109
want to go then

545
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:31,540
that's why i told you if you're not
changing at all then i wouldn't

546
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,470
recommend any to do anything like this
you know if you're just going along

547
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:40,899
reducing study processes and nothing
changes that you don't like then you

548
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:47,589
know go for it but you can also go back
baseline or activity recognition for

549
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:52,990
baseline activity and then see if
anything's changed after losing weight

550
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:56,828
and something that said I want anyone to
feel bad if they're gaining later

551
00:48:56,829 --> 00:48:59,980
anything like that that's not the
purpose of my talk here

552
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:05,230
I just want to like try to convey some
information to other people but how do

553
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:12,760
we going going about to establish a
baseline like that

554
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:21,280
blog yes and hire specialists solving
personal trainer

555
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,740
yes so to the baseline I've been
tracking everything everything everyday

556
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:31,779
so everything you put beside yourself
what happened that sounded very weird

557
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:49,960
water everything you eat everyday try it
all and then just look a lot like

558
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,200
MyFitnessPal and see what the actual
calories or that you're actually taking

559
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,210
every day there's a lot of things you do
you just don't have to use technology

560
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:03,670
like MyFitnessPal do that you can
actually just write it down to journal

561
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:12,040
but that brings me to more like i
mentioned before if you want more

562
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,119
precision want someone actually give you
the answers and you don't think about me

563
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:19,569
this stuff hire somebody that can
actually help you there

564
00:50:19,569 --> 00:50:20,950
ah

565
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:25,629
in novi everywhere it's all of you what
you give into a language before you can

566
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:30,310
have the greatest fitness expert in the
world or nutrition expert but if you

567
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:33,549
don't actually apply the principles and
whether it's telling you to do not go

568
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:36,430
workout we actually have to trust the
process

569
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:42,129
so where you choose out there that's
that's all on on you i can recommend

570
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,540
people have you on stage but i can
recommend people that I know of

571
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:52,000
ah but you have to actually apply those
principles to life

572
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,730
it's not working unless you do it quick
question common area over the edge

573
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:11,320
putting their edition package deals you
got heart problems

574
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:24,820
I part right here is a night as local
coastal motors has dietitian on staff

575
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:29,650
help you out there so there's people out
there getting keep you advised and i am

576
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:33,430
running short on time here so i'm going
to try to graph things out a few more

577
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:38,500
slides on one of things i learned
throughout doing this was to be a little

578
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:44,650
bit Gnostic in my e principles I kind of
went from a very strict you know

579
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:52,300
hey Leo or low low car quito type way or
you know what whatever happens to be my

580
00:51:52,300 --> 00:52:00,640
kind of creating what's known as well
call the top method so my my basic diet

581
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:06,759
their their rooms that there there's
room for your favorite foods inside of

582
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:13,150
this journey you know what about dieting
there's room for whatever you like as

583
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,720
long as you have the knowledge behind it
and make an informed decision about

584
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,899
where you're actually going to intake
yourself does that make sense

585
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,800
there you don't have to give up
everything you want you have to be

586
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,869
formed to know we're actually going to
do so

587
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,259
I don't think there are any bad dudes
out there critical bad foods food is

588
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:41,160
mutual right there is no bad food out
there my opinion your buildings around

589
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:47,819
it can severely cause you some stress
and problems like oh this is that it's

590
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:51,720
it's totally neutral it's true feelings
around it if there's room for all those

591
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,410
things

592
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,649
there's just not you know if you have a
specific goal

593
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:00,509
there's room for a little bit of it
perhaps as much as you like that make

594
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:08,130
sense so mutual your feelings are gonna
be stressful if you have a gmail you

595
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:14,279
need to know how fit into your goal your
overall holder like I said I've been

596
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:20,039
basically the last six months eating
talkers to lose weight and I do that by

597
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:25,049
1i talked about learning how to cook i
learned how to cook those knockers like

598
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:29,309
so i make my tortillas I know exactly
the caloric intake side of each of those

599
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:33,210
right so you don't have one target or
the 11 grams of carbs and stuff like

600
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,839
that i first meet on top and a little
bit of cheese and then I have a basic

601
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:45,089
building block of food there and I love
almost for tacos in future I didn't have

602
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:51,450
a wedding itself so I if you want
actually i have all my slide notes on

603
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,250
taco method . com

604
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:58,950
so if you want to go there it's it's on
a basic blog site blogger site so it's

605
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:03,629
talk about the dot-com but basically
it's all my slide shows and I'll have

606
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:08,609
some more information about my journey
but I i guess i would recommend or what

607
00:54:08,609 --> 00:54:15,299
I've done work for me again just that
that's worked for me and some other

608
00:54:15,299 --> 00:54:20,819
things we have to consider when we're or
were on this transition or journey or

609
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:21,329
you know

610
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:24,989
no other species you want to stay right
here is that we have to deal with some

611
00:54:24,989 --> 00:54:30,209
setbacks right on we have to all keep in
mind that we are human beings are going

612
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:33,808
to make a mistake and we're gonna slip
up right here and there

613
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:38,609
oh and like I said there's no bad food
but if you go over let if you're walking

614
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:41,759
things you know you went over then you
don't be honest with yourself

615
00:54:41,759 --> 00:54:46,589
forgive yourself one it's not that bad
it's not that big of a deal right

616
00:54:46,589 --> 00:54:50,640
a lot of people beat themselves up over
nothing right

617
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,170
forgive yourself but also and that's it
. being honest with yourself and then

618
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,709
just start back over you can't really
can't cry over spilled milk

619
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:06,809
the will feel good getting this warning
just be honest with yourself and forgive

620
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:13,499
yourself and give that on the worst are
some other things around 2 i'm coming to

621
00:55:13,499 --> 00:55:17,879
the end of my presentation here
traveling and nutrition prob so the

622
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:23,069
things i learned we're traveling is that
preparation is key if I just if I don't

623
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:26,640
repair and i stayed up too late and I
have to catch my flight and flavor 6am

624
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,629
flight and a half the weight of it or
three someone some grading I'm not gonna

625
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:35,009
be prepared i'm gonna be running out the
door and get something right and one of

626
00:55:35,009 --> 00:55:37,499
those things would be probably eating
something in the morning so i get the

627
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:42,988
airport first paragraph so preparations
be there especially when going to

628
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:46,499
clients sides or traveling for a week or
two weeks however long you have to be

629
00:55:46,499 --> 00:55:52,979
away sometimes even coming to comes into
play with knowing what's inside of food

630
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:57,390
basically and they don't really teach us
in schools don't teach you what's the

631
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:03,509
Lord value of top or of tortilla right
so we don't really know what's inside of

632
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:09,150
the jury right we know its needs but how
many grams of protein or XYZ just

633
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:14,099
knowing what's inside of you can help
you then a later on determine or

634
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:18,509
actually look out now we look up all
these things nutrition guidelines on the

635
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:23,160
internet about what restaurant we can go
to pick my goals and my example I would

636
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:29,920
go to chipotle or and I if I get a 30
fully loaded I know

637
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,040
it's going to have a lot more calories
inside of the night actually need to fit

638
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:39,640
my goals but i can also go to say to the
most dirtiest word and fast food taco

639
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:46,540
bell i go there and still get a same
thing that's similar and still fits my

640
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,589
needs and I can go to like McDonald's
you know that's the everyone's favorite

641
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:56,170
thing to beat up on Donald's makes me it
makes people gain weight and stuff like

642
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,980
that but you can go to those places that
still within your guidelines as long as

643
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:03,819
you have informed choice and that's one
of those things that like I like to you

644
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:10,869
take away from here so no once what
restaurant you go to also bring some

645
00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:16,359
food if necessary such as whey protein
or you know press bar stuff like that

646
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:20,200
just being prepared a little bit like
taking a little bit of time ahead of

647
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,578
time to do this stuff

648
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:25,180
ah buy some supplies your whole of your
hotel

649
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,880
I said multiple times when i first get
to my hotel I will go to the grocery

650
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,869
store and five some groceries right
basic basic stuff and if they're

651
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:43,990
perishable like you know me like that or
like you know punch me something that I

652
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:47,439
first ahead ensign preparation I call
the hotel make sure that there's going

653
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,750
to be a mini-fridge zone just so i can
store some things that may spoil but if

654
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:58,450
not if you can't do that then just buy
some fresh fruit and and eat that

655
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:04,390
so if you have to get out and do know
your normal human being and go yourself

656
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:11,319
our client dinners and socializing I
would just apply the veggies and meat so

657
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:17,349
try to have the servings of vegetables
like initiative for any meats right and

658
00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:20,230
stay away from too much everything else

659
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,140
are there a lot of fats and carbs

660
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:29,560
especially in the preparation such as
oils fats butter stuff like that so just

661
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:35,920
be aware of that so try to keep apply
the veggie and ghouls there if you if

662
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:41,530
you're gonna drink but you're probably
on the beginning to do truck this

663
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:47,770
weekend I would not have anything in my
resignation but if you're out a normal

664
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:52,509
dinner or something like that try to
keep it down to two three drinks tonight

665
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:58,150
again it's all on your preference and i
would try to tend towards your liquors

666
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:07,510
gin-clear helo stuff like that and
calories remixers alcohol and itself is

667
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:11,830
not ideal for phallus is empty calories
there is no nutritional value so it's

668
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:17,980
all your body for has to burn that first
before anything else so we can buy that

669
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:22,030
stuff it's going to have to bring that
first before it burns anything else that

670
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:28,690
is going to reach your goals was a stay
hydrated with water throughout the

671
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:34,150
Middle now in town so water with you
again keep in mind we're trying to get a

672
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:40,420
half your body weight in in water per
day especially if you're drinking right

673
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:47,740
and take more water are one thing out of
it is like to go out to the service and

674
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,549
take away that they bring the tables but
if that's your goal but if you're trying

675
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:55,870
to stand track and try to my goal they
bring read the table that's one of the

676
00:59:55,870 --> 01:00:01,240
things that people just I will
annihilate like it's my favorite thing

677
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:08,049
and yeah I will annihilate read in an
instant so just telling people if you

678
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,070
can't control yourself

679
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:12,820
just tell them to take away for you are
pushed into farthest corner table for

680
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:19,600
yourself so that brings me towards the
tail end of here is that just some seek

681
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:24,819
some support through community also as
well there's a group online by hackers

682
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:28,450
on facebook if you just look at body
hackers

683
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:33,460
who were group of people interest trying
to basically support each other and

684
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:39,610
progressed well as a lot of trolling
what select rolling but no one's gonna

685
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:46,810
make you feel about what you're doing in
your choices so there's a lot you look

686
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,950
we're going to encourage you right there
is also a lot of trainers out there to

687
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:55,899
that will have online group step will
support your progression for your

688
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:00,220
journey throughout this for so you know
no one's gonna make fun of you for

689
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:05,770
posting you know a progression pictures
along that if anything is gonna be about

690
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:18,190
BMI or something crazy advance it and
one things that I've come to take away

691
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:23,770
is that like there's been multiple times
like I posted something and or I just

692
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:28,000
ran into somebody you know and they said
you know I really appreciate when post

693
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:35,170
before and it inspired me to actually do
XYZ and I don't know this person but you

694
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:40,660
know some something I did all the way I
said it actually affected them and it

695
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:45,250
inspired that maybe is a little bit ly
got to my horrible like ah you never

696
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:49,300
know who you're going to inspire but
what you say so

697
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:54,430

knowledge on things is the best of your

698
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:59,560
ability and you never know we're going
to run it to somebody that has been

699
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:04,420

meaningful way to share your successes

701
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:12,970
and then lastly here are just a little
perspective right now what we're talking

702
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:18,640
about here is like it's a little bit
vain I guess we're talking about or at

703
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,500
least for me is considering there's a
little bit of perspective necessary for

704
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,160
some clothes

705
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,379
keep in mind here

706
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:30,880
de nada foods for the purposes of
looking better is really only a luxury

707
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,120
for all very very minority of people
right we're very lucky to be in that

708
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:41,710
category that actually be considering
this as a possibility parcels right in

709
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:42,310
no time

710
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:49,840
ministry has denied limiting food and a
thing that people do is just a little

711
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:54,700
bit of perspective there are you know
any if you can't do it if its family and

712
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:59,950
don't beat yourself up about it just
remind yourself that it is a perspective

713
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:04,960
c'mon i guess is what I'm trying to
process here without being too without

714

proselytizing here and then lastly i
