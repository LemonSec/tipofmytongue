1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,790
yeah right do I have to wait another
minute you guys mind if I started

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,959
minutes early

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:21,420
ok so my name is Amanda Berlin this is
lee it's just this last minute he got

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,109
called out to a customer engagement in
California so you couldn't make it so I

5
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:29,609
brought him with me instead if you want
to take any pictures he now has his own

6
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:37,710
Twitter account so you know do whatever
you want with it

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,370
so this is so you've inherited the
security department now what the idea of

8
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,070
this talk came from our talk and then
book came from a ranti blog post when I

9
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,219
when I want to rant I'd end up writing a
couple years ago I was just pissed off

10
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,730
at every environment that I saw had the
same problems over and over again

11
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,190
because nobody ever did the basics

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,450
oh shit sorry

13
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:16,679
yeah like putting the cables all the way
and it was just kind of a all this all

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,820
this stuff out there is free that you
can do it just takes a little bit of

15
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:29,429
work and nobody's doing it so I nice i
brought the blog post and then started

16
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,820
talking to our Riley and turned into a
book so that's me i work at hurricane

17
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,710
labs as an information security
architect we do splunk implementation

18
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,990
and managed service you managed service
stuff around that sock that kind of

19
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:53,729
stuff i worked in healthcare ISPs I've
done the hurricane lab thing now for

20
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,829
almost two years

21
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,479
Lee works for Leviathan

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:11,329
yeah well I'm not gonna introduce him
know he's not here yeah did you do so

23
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:17,480
that's my Twitter handle my butt my blog
I haven't updated recently but I've been

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,700
kind of busy

25
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,298
this is the book it's not on print yet
but you can pre-order it online it's on

26
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:33,110
safari online the first four chapters
are out now and it should be on print in

27
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,810
march and O'Reilly has been absolutely
wonderful to work with

28
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,940
so if anybody's ever interested in
creating content or writing a book or

29
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,790
anything I really highly recommend them

30
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:55,099
it's a male in porcupine if anybody's
curious i wanted a different animal but

31
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,849
the porcupines good i wanted the narwhal
first they said I couldn't have a

32
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:04,399
narwhal not you can't pick a
mythological creature it has to be a

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,630
real animal

34
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:12,049
it's real yeah so I thought that mean
that party finds a pretty good defensive

35
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:18,319
animal anyway so it fits the title well
I couldn't have a narwhal you couldn't

36
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,750
pick ya was already on a book you can
have one that's you can reuse there's

37
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:36,590
not like different kinds of narwhals so
so here here's the premise so there's

38
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,549
like I said there's so much out there
that nobody's doing you just want to be

39
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:45,079
better than the next guy and we'll go
through a lot of the free and easy stuff

40
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:50,540
that you can do some of the stuff that's
free and not super easy and then finish

41
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:56,929
it out with stuff that probably cost a
lot of money and I like this quote many

42
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,519
attacks on internet and network systems
have no particular target the attacker

43
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,200
simply sends a large broadcast that uses
any unprotected system as a staging

44
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,728
point from which to launch an attack we
know this using computers without basic

45
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:14,570
protections like firewalls and antivirus
and user education not only affects your

46
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,140
own business

47
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,940
many other businesses as the virus
spread on the internet so that's when

48
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,640
the Internet Security Alliance guide
we're just trying to bulk up the overall

49
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:32,930
security internet one of the first steps
you should probably take when you're in

50
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,410
an organization is work with the data
stakeholders work with c-level

51
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,930
executives that kind of stuff you don't
want to just start changing shit you

52
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,890
know that things can go wrong and you
don't want everybody to be running into

53
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,229
your office because you know taking out
a million things I even a simple like

54
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,750
nmap scan will take down some serious
serious stuff I've seen a takedown like

55
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:04,400
full phone systems VPN endpoints like
that it's always something that you want

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,489
to plan out you can't actually explain
to them all of the stuff that you you

57
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,020
can do for free like all all executives
like the fact that when you come to them

58
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,030
and say you you can fix all of these
issues and you can do it for free i mean

59
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,039
how often does that happen

60
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,979
you got you want to show them that
you've done your due diligence and

61
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,950
you've done everything you can possibly
do before you go back to them and ask

62
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,440
for money

63
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,700
mhm when you when you talk to them you
know depending on the size your

64
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,550
organization you can create a task force
you can you know if you don't have a

65
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,350
security department yet in your building
one that that's the point when you want

66
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:50,360
to actually have a plan to go forward in
that plan should be milestones you

67
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,900
should know what your risks are and what
you look like what keeps you up at night

68
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,830
you know every every business is going
to be different you might not have any

69
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,979
uh you know card data or healthcare data
anything like that but you might have

70
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,849
you know some trade secret that you
never want your competitor to have so

71
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,610
everybody's going to have their own
risks and that's that's what you want to

72
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,610
focus and build your playing around

73
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,440
so

74
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,710
Oh asset management is huge

75
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,320
I've not seen yet one place that can do
asset management right they'll have like

76
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:33,940
maybe they'll maybe know ninety percent
what's on their network it's it's one of

77
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,170
the biggest hurdles i can i see people
trying to overcome that should be your

78
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,390
primary focus

79
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:47,080
it's not definitely not easy but having
like once having one source of truth so

80
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,330
i I've also seen we're like yeah we know
what domain controllers we have therein

81
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:58,930
you know there's a list on in in dns but
always we have we have like 10

82
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,590
subdomains and we're not sure where all
those are and but we have it on

83
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,099
sharepoint to but we also have this
excel spreadsheet and nobody knows which

84
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,460
was right

85
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,989
visibility through your network so those
subdomains knowing what you do and don't

86
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,620
have access to if it's a bigger
corporation you might not have access to

87
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,230
anything that's been delegated drawing
out what where exactly you will have

88
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:30,250
visibility at is going to be key point
in asset management and automating it so

89
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,220
you don't want to have to sit there
month-by-month and do it all in a

90
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,840
spreadsheet by hand

91
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,890
you know pulling data from the different
different areas you want it to be

92
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,909
something that is pretty seamless
otherwise you're gonna spend a lot of

93
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:52,780
your time wasted on trying to figure out
what all is out there and then don't

94
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,059
forget the cloud just because it's not
on your on your land doesn't mean you're

95
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:04,390
not going to be responsible for the
security of it so starting with the free

96
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:12,070
and easy this is a pretty cool website
07 framework com 0007 so if anybody

97
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,169
doesn't know ocean is it's open source
intelligence stuff that you can get out

98
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:25,090
on the internet about a company that it
you know is is public knowledge or maybe

99
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,859
shouldn't be public knowledge but it's
still out on the internet

100
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,269
if you're looking to switch jobs or if
you're already somewhere you can do all

101
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:37,729
of this ocean against your company
without causing any problems just just

102
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:42,620
more data collection this website's
kinda just a little gooey that will go

103
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,220
through and show you which tools are out
there which websites are out there for

104
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,190
the different categories

105
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:56,450
another thing that you can do is build
with this will tell you what your web

106
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:04,700
servers are built on you might not know
you know I you know Joe from you know

107
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,250
ten years ago created your website on
the windows 2000 box and is and it's not

108
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,550
in your asset list it's not anywhere
that you've seen it before and but you

109
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,170
know you can you can find it with google
you can find it you know you can find

110
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,399
out what's actually on there so you know
what you do you're gonna start to secure

111
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,850
there's a lot of like you know scanning
tools and stuff that'll trying to attack

112
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,060
that the different technologies out
there needing you don't want anything

113
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:43,489
public-facing obviously to be you know
insecure out there on the internet recon

114
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,250
angie is pretty cool 40 sent it will go
out there and up so it's written like

115
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,660
metasploit is you can load modules that
kind of stuff it's kind of like multi go

116
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,819
if anybody's multi go before it's just
command line instead of the pretty good

117
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:06,470
we it will look for all of the different
subdomains and other things like email

118
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:12,500
that kind of stuff which meant attackers
going to you know anybody has access to

119
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,620
write so that's that's that could be a
primary focus for you to start to secure

120
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:27,070
the harvester is a Python script that's
included with kelly and downloaded

121
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:34,390
whatever and we'll search linkedin
google facebook whatever for email

122
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:40,660
addresses for your domain this is what i
used i did an internal fishing user

123
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,430
education awareness at the hospital used
to work for this is what I used for the

124
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:51,729
first round of attacks because this is
what everybody else has access to super

125
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,420
easy to take me now takes like less than
five minutes to come up with an email

126
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,030
list of everybody everybody's at
addresses that are out there those are

127
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,250
the ones that are going to start to get
hit the most are the ones that are going

128
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,870
to get fish the most those are the
people that you want to bulk up training

129
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,870
on on deck me of that stuff

130
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:20,260
hmm something else for ocean it showed
him another great tool for asset

131
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:32,740
management he never know what's going to
be out on out on the internet that link

132
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,610
right there

133
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,050
the think it's like five ten dollars to
buy his book it's pretty good luck will

134
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,380
show you a bunch of different tools and
and search queries that you can run

135
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:46,030
children run against your domain run
against your IP address list

136
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:58,780
lots of people have never run a
vulnerability scanner in there on their

137
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,459
network right when I a couple several
places that I've worked so far

138
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,060
I show up and no they mean what it

139
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,349
yeah exactly what is that why should I
have to run a village and they don't

140
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:17,500
want I mean we all know that you need to
do that but why you know how are you

141
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,300
going to let them know that it's worth
the money get a trial run a scan against

142
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,829
even a subset of your network and say
look like this is physical proof this is

143
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,590
what we found this is what can happen

144
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,840
and then down the line after you fix
what you've already found in the trial

145
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
vulnerability scanner you can go further
from there

146
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:47,020
that's practice or policy objects so I
for a long time was a windows admin yay

147
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,500
not seem right

148
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,340
yeah that's a little bit

149
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,340
thank you thank you Dad yes thank you

150
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:03,520
somebody has to do it right I at one
point had a printed out copy of every

151
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,819
gpo on our network and went through them
and by hand

152
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,820
boy it was a nightmare

153
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:17,829
yes right there's a lot of things that
you can do with your policy like locking

154
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:24,640
down like locking down new additions to
active directory you know somebody joins

155
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:31,689
joins a pc to active directory and you
don't know where it is you don't know

156
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:36,010
you know it could be some new help desk
analyst that doesn't know the policies

157
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,810
that you need antivirus you need to do
system hardening that kind of stuff just

158
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:47,770
as it to the main plug it in and it can
just go you can use your policy to lock

159
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:53,800
down all new additions so they are
they're actually forced at that point to

160
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,579
do the system hardening you know that
they only have the option to reboot

161
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,140
they're not activated they can't do
anything else in so many programs

162
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,400
anything like that until they either
place it in the correct oh you you know

163
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,329
do the other you knew local gpo's for
system hardening that way if anything

164
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,310
ever leaves your domain it's already
hardened you don't have to worry about

165
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,739
it contacting domain controllers for any
changes and there's you know I could

166
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,740
talk for days and days about GPS but
that's the basics

167
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:32,410
as few as possible domain admins how
many places have you been where all of

168
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,850
the programmers something I have domain
admin all of you know helped us has to

169
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,470
make asthma and everybody everybody gets
domain admin because it's easier you can

170
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,640
install all the software that always
works you can always contact whatever

171
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,350
sure you want great everything you know
it's everybody should have it just

172
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,230
because it's easier

173
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,060
no unless you know what the hell domain
admin is and what they can do you

174
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:05,979
shouldn't be one getting rid of that
difficult though to so i put it under

175
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,730
free and easy because in concept like
you'd think it'd be easy sometimes

176
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,370
they're so it's more of a people thing
right so they're so ingrained that

177
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,840
everything is going to always work that
they don't want that that power taken

178
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,910
away from them so sometimes that can be
difficult or if you know the domain

179
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,560
admin didn't double the DA account is
actually you know running a service or

180
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:36,910
something you know of you if you take
them out and break shit getting rid of

181
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:44,350
open chairs the cool and maps script you
don't have to write that down that will

182
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,760
search the network for anything that's
an open chair open chairs are bad

183
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,120
everybody has access to it unless you
want to use that kind of like a canary

184
00:15:52,120 --> 00:16:00,610
in the coalmine type a type thing for
detecting malware ransom or whatever

185
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:06,370
there's also one in i think i'm pretty
sure there's one in powershell that you

186
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:13,360
can do to that will go out and search
for all of the shares disabled telling

187
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,920
that and other insecure protocols

188
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,920
I know tell that's fun

189
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:28,790
everybody knows the port already and
other security protocols so like lights

190
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:34,250
out cards that protocol that lights out
cards use for your servers a super

191
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:42,440
insecure I and they also usually have
default creds so you can just hop on

192
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,430
anybody you want just because that's
still open and nobody ever changes the

193
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:53,959
password trial of cards when I mean
honestly there's there's places that

194
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,369
have you know shit equipment out there
that doesn't support anything other than

195
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,510
telnet so you're not gonna be able to
always shut it off but you can alert on

196
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:14,119
the use locking down login / https
no-brainer right this is a 5 device that

197
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:20,928
i found i did the social engineering CTF
last year at Def Con and they give you

198
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,119
well it's it's a competition where they
give you a company and a list of things

199
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,820
to find out about them so i did all that
07 research that I talked about for

200
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:39,678
frontier and they didn't have this there
there f5 lockdown to http guess you

201
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,200
could just all of them like i found i
don't know probably 50 of them at least

202
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:54,600
for them that were just all the same
people still speaking

203
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:05,370
store . text passwords well I the first
pen test that the hospital that i work

204
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,918
for had was actually performed by now
you know what it wasn't president yet

205
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,919
another company and huh

206
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:23,100
one of our network admins save all of
the password for the organization in a

207
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,100
password-protected excel spreadsheet

208
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:34,320
its password protected right i mean it's
cool like I don't think at that point

209
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:41,520
that I mean they got they got demanded
domain admin in five minutes maybe I

210
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,950
mean it wasn't even because we hadn't
done any of this hardening that

211
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:55,350
absolutely none of it I amazing horror
stories about templates no open Wi-Fi

212
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:03,030
another horror story we had a completely
open Wi-Fi there gotta i was working at

213
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,289
the helpdesk at the time got a call from
a lady that said the Wi-Fi wasn't

214
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:11,070
working and it was one of our one of our
duties to go you know help the patient's

215
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,730
be able to connect to the Wi-Fi so they
could do whatever they needed to do and

216
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,789
like all right well what room number you
and I'll come up there and you know

217
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,970
we'll get this fixed so no i'm over on
someone's wall street

218
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:27,450
oh ok thick she was just calling to let
us know that internet wasn't working

219
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:38,070
because that's what she relied on was
are open like by which was also like the

220
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:45,658
the it got th to get a guy DHCP and DNS
from our domain controllers so that

221
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:47,280
that's amazing

222
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,490
hmm

223
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:52,000
the things she didn't know how to
connect to it that well

224
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,770
no shouting ports that are unused and
setting up port security you don't want

225
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,059
somebody to just be able to walk in and
plug into the wall and act like they're

226
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:06,428
they belong there and do whatever the
hell they want because that port is more

227
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:09,820
than likely if you don't have it shut
offer for configured correctly going to

228
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,840
be on your main Network right vlan1
where everybody likes to keep everything

229
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,360
you know they'll have both out have
access to everything so you wanted

230
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,690
there's there's a couple to put
different pieces of software that will

231
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,600
kind of alert on that you can set up a
network access control which also cost

232
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:35,590
money but later down the line we did
what we did it all manually we looked at

233
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:41,709
all of the switch ports and just shut
them off all manually on like 70-80

234
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:47,800
switches which isn't fun but you know it
offers a lot of protection setting up

235
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,980
port security so nobody can walk up

236
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,270
unplug the unplugged somebody else's pc
and plug into it for security will

237
00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:03,879
automatically detect that and shut off
the port who for the love of God in

238
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:13,030
cycling SL and switching the tls so this
this percentage was $OPERAND NL I'd i

239
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,290
gave this talk

240
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,889
well kind of a version of this talk like
six months ago that was a status that

241
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:24,640
thirty-three percent of https servers
are vulnerable to what hartley-brown

242
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,500
poodle free all the all the fancy name
Varner abilities that get their own

243
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:36,010
logos you can use ssl labs to test your
sights to see if they're vulnerable for

244
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,910
any of this

245
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,770
instead of doing the work yourself like
this is just a cool tool that will tell

246
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:50,650
you for you know and this is how to pick
em I I'm Sands has a great list on how

247
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,650
to

248
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:14,360
beyond the news for you know healthcare
provider or you know this store lost so

249
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,928
many thousand credit card numbers
whatever and endpoint encryption is

250
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:27,830
gonna definitely help with that and
that's free configuration backups and

251
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:33,889
not only backups restricting who have
access to the backups the backup is I

252
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:38,390
mean pretty important somebody can walk
away with that and do some pretty bad

253
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:46,850
stuff you don't want to just sitting on
a server that anybody has access to that

254
00:22:46,850 --> 00:23:00,469
your linux boxes because everybody
always forgets to do that can we please

255
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,529
for the love of God remove java off of
everything

256
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:12,169
yeah and flash yes just kill it and
silverlight if it keeps coming back

257
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:18,919
I don't know there's third-party caching
software that will update it for you but

258
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,700
why have to worry about updates when you
can just remove it

259
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,210
black browsing from servers should be a
no-brainer

260
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:37,340
i I've seen like porn ads popup on
domain controllers

261
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:45,370
like know now why and my god

262
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,170
yeah i mean those diseases have a lot of
power you know that streaming comes in

263
00:23:50,170 --> 00:24:01,150
really quick and all the HD want not
only logging unsuccessful logins

264
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,080
belonging successful logins there's a
lot of correlation that you can do with

265
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:13,210
those somebodies you know didn't
successfully login 10 times and then

266
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,170
they did in in rapid succession you know
that might be something that you want to

267
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:23,410
look into already talked about that i
love i love cards always have a default

268
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:28,390
password there's a mess . while module
that you can run against your network

269
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,620
that will tell you where all your
eyelids are I think maybe it's just for

270
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:47,439
Delta but i'm not i'm not positive HPS
to right and just do your dns servers

271
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,670
and DC's should only be doing that
that's their main role that that's like

272
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,260
in a Windows environment that's your
heat that's your key device if something

273
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:02,950
happens to those that's that's not not
going to be good like i was talking

274
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:10,630
about the lady with the Wi-Fi so those
that DC that gave her her dhcp address

275
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:16,780
is over Wi-Fi on our public Wi-Fi also
had sequel installed and that sequel

276
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:25,120
instance was running the the database
backend for our public web server which

277
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,929
was dual homes so you could access like
both networks and there was no firewall

278
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:37,270
between you could go full circle you
could come in from the internet get from

279
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:47,379
our iis6 box get from there you can rdp
from that web server to the DC that had

280
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,470
the its sequel server on it because the
vendors that created the website needed

281
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,200
access to the sequel database

282
00:25:52,200 --> 00:26:03,330
and then you know get out to the guest
network and then just repeat turn off on

283
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:09,658
its own transfers people can clean a lot
of information from transferring your

284
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:16,830
fault zone already covered that open
mail relays there's a great list on the

285
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:21,960
Internet of servers that have opened
mail relay that you can just send

286
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,649
whatever you want to whoever you want
and pretend whoever you want you know

287
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:30,840
whatever you want to be it's really easy
to use to send mail right I use them all

288
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,799
the time

289
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:42,539
ftp to there's a good list of free to
email Peppa hmm good list of ftp servers

290
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:50,100
out there that don't require off forcing
advanced auditing for ransom or

291
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,620
detection so this is a ass . capture can
you tell where the ransomware start

292
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:02,879
encrypting stuff right that's gonna be
detectable I mean it's not always

293
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,510
possible this it turning on advanced
auditing on endpoints can really kill

294
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:15,389
they're not you know disk usage and
whatever but when possible the great

295
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:20,580
detection tool i mean at that point it
might be too late but at least you can

296
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:28,168
you know stop it when it's on its way
this is not disco so earlier when I was

297
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:32,909
talking about turning off the port's
that kind of stuff this fixes it so you

298
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:36,630
don't necessarily have to do everything
by hand it will tell you it's free

299
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,399
software it at one point it was kind of
a pain in the ass to set up but it will

300
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:46,678
show you what's connected on what port
it will give you the mac address how

301
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:52,799
long it's been connected the port
history how many versions of iOS you

302
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:59,429
have in your hand in your infrastructure
huge list of different things it will

303
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:03,090
tell you supports honor off just a great
tool

304
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,500
i I'd I mean I think you should put it
in anywhere just great for the price and

305
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,840
I don't forget your printers anybody
remember when this happened

306
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,439
we've sent out a bunch of Nazi shit two
printers everywhere in the world I

307
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:29,190
during the book and during shooting this
talking whatever I asked all the red

308
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,179
teamers I know because I'm not I'm
really really not that good at offensive

309
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:38,040
stuff right so like all right what what
are some of the top things that you find

310
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,750
that you will get you domain admin will
get you access to sensitive data

311
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:49,740
whatever like you know what people leave
you know their domain admin or you know

312
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,760
regular admin accounts plain text on
printers all the time that has access to

313
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,660
share that can scan 2 or whatever it's
just easier to put you know that that

314
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:07,980
admin account in there so it just works
so some software that you can install

315
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:16,110
all of this is free so you're also on
URL scan is for windows boxes that are

316
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:23,729
running web servers will filter
uncertain things like some somebody

317
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:29,850
trying to attack your website it it will
see in block certain require certain

318
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,800
requests that season the logs
automatically fail demand scans log

319
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:41,040
files on linux looks for weird stuff
like a bunch of failed login attempts

320
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:48,840
well it's like scans that kind of stuff
and we'll automatically block

321
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,250
yeah in the local linux firewall
modsecurity is a web application

322
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:59,700
firewall will do full HTTP traffic
logging will do a passive security

323
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,100
assessment continuously and it will do
real-time monitoring of the website

324
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:12,300
microsoft baseline security analyzer
great to run on any new server spin-up

325
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,730
should be just part of the process tells
you you know what what you're doing on

326
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,450
the server

327
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:24,840
secure not as far as Microsoft those and
then have a minute so i always forget

328
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,409
what the standard enhance mitigation
experience toolkit

329
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:35,550
alright thanks Pete looks for like
zero-day type behavior on on windows

330
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,000
boxes and old men will block will block
it

331
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:46,379
we implemented this by hand which sucks
but there's a great blog on trusted sex

332
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:53,250
website that will show you how to script
it out and install it everywhere I think

333
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,730
this is a pretty cool concept and all
these are backwards i'm single room

334
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:04,410
alright so I our bug out bag like when
the shit really hits the fan you don't

335
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,520
want to be scrambling around trying to
find bits and pieces of things

336
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:15,450
everywhere that you might have to use
you know you want so bootable USB Drive

337
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,450
cds whatever two different

338
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:28,290
oh there's like so Callie is just
something that was like meant as COO was

339
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:40,170
it so base in jizz that you normally use
a laptop that isn't on a domain because

340
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,010
if something happens to your domain
controller you want to be able to still

341
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:51,600
login lots of storage for downloading
the logs if you can access storage that

342
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,560
kind of stuff

343
00:31:52,560 --> 00:32:01,860
gluten handbook it was well before I
even created the blog that started all

344
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,860
this shit storm i read that it's all on
ir a great book it just didn't cover

345
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,120
everything that I wanted it to cover so
that's I'd like to think it's a good

346
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,580
make up for what that one doesn't cover
but for instant response it's amazing

347
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:23,580
yeah you got it right there authors
pretty cool guy cables mifi number tap

348
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:30,419
whereas be your in particular I our
playbook sands had some that you can use

349
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,920
and kind of go off of it

350
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,550
they have huge just form like
step-by-step what you should be looking

351
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:41,700
for for what type of incidents it's
great to use and next as you might be up

352
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:52,080
for a while so the stuff that isn't
super easy start to purple team there's

353
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,010
been some great purple team talks over
the last you know several years when

354
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:02,070
this started to become a whole concept
Fisher users scanned the inside your

355
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:06,030
networking between penn tests don't just
rely on the vulnerability assessments

356
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,990
start to learn what the offenses is
going to be in the attackers are gonna

357
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,410
be coming after it's great that you're
going to be good at blue team but you

358
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:21,540
should also know without saying a son
zooskool quote what they're doing user

359
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:30,060
education super super important never
use a stick always use a carrot you

360
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,649
don't want to piss off your users are
going to be your best defense they're

361
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,850
the most targeted and one of your
biggest risks is fishing through users

362
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,379
that are going to give up their password
give access to their desktop to somebody

363
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,000
that calls in and pretend they're from
support you need to give them as much

364
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,410
training as they need go through
different steps the the one that I had

365
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:01,440
put in you and there were ever every
month we would fish anywhere from fifty

366
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,360
two thousand users at a time and
automatically send them through training

367
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,389
after that anytime they would report
anything you like official either

368
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,870
phishing email from us or one that came
in from the outside they would get

369
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:20,429
entered into a drawing so it's something
that they know then that they want to

370
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:25,710
participate in going to be your greatest
help to that that those kind of threats

371
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:35,580
there's a script out there that you can
run to randomize your law local admin

372
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:41,340
passwords that way you're not doing
password to use son you know 3,000 and

373
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,150
me know

374
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,710
PCN points across the environment

375
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:52,300
makes it harder to pivot and least
privilege of concept not giving Debbie

376
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:58,930
an HR access to this equal servers not
giving everybody access to backups and

377
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:04,509
stuff sometimes it's in a smaller
environment it's not as easy especially

378
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:09,099
in inside the IT organization just
because everybody's kind of a

379
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:13,060
jack-of-all-trades they need to have
access to certain things just gives your

380
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:21,490
small group but at a certain point you
need to have work like roll separation

381
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:27,970
application whitelisting instead of
blacklisting if you application

382
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,580
blacklisting you're just like trying to
whack a mole on all the different

383
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,240
applications are out there you can spend
up an exe that named anything there's no

384
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:43,479
way you're going to detect on that if
you do blacklisting this is not easy is

385
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,950
if you have no going back to asset
management again if you don't know what

386
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,700
software that your company uses you
won't know where to even start for this

387
00:35:51,700 --> 00:36:03,129
and doing canary in the coal mine set up
a share that is open as a couple files

388
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:07,510
in it and alert on all access to it you
know

389
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:16,869
normal people won't know that it's there
anyways a script will find it so set up

390
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,490
a set up a sequel server nobody's
supposed to you know do database queries

391
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:27,220
to it worked on that whatever is one of
the bigger roles that you know is in

392
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:34,390
your infrastructure take something and
and make a fake copy of it for pulling

393
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:42,368
out like oh send emails so on your
website where nobody can see it put it

394
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,540
in white text on white background put in
black text on a black background put a

395
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,770
fake email address

396
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:52,690
anytime that e-mail address gets emailed
you know what somebody scraping your

397
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,690
site sending to everybody that can find

398
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:03,839
and egress from turning so many people
don't filter outbound traffic because I

399
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,349
mean all the threats come from the
outside right there's no way that

400
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:13,170
somebody's gonna bring a laptop in from
home infected everywhere and get

401
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:17,039
everything else infected huh

402
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:21,509
you didn't answer China mine too

403
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:33,720
purple teaming more purple gaming so
like I said I I i consider myself really

404
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,669
really shitty it and everything
offensive but some of it's not super

405
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,259
difficult there there are so many good
tools out there that you can do basic

406
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:51,720
red teaming inside your organization
responder was listed as one of the top

407
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,480
tools used to gain domain admin asst
domain admin by spiderlabs I mean they

408
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:05,730
wrote it but I little bias it's great
it's amazing red team tool you can see

409
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:12,989
all the netbios queries which so netbios
and all men are so i would say super

410
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:21,960
past windows pcs use that before they
call out to dns and it can be very

411
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,859
easily spooked with responder their
credentials can be captured over that on

412
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:35,279
this so nmap and masscan will show you a
list of devices on your network

413
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,759
vulnerabilities that kind of stuff but
be very careful

414
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:44,640
I've broken a lot of things like using
these I think I took down

415
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:52,230
what was it see their checkpoint a
reporting it just by doing a mass can

416
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,440
just kill brought it to its knees
everybody's vpns went down

417
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:02,160
not not fun when everybody called you
are you doing a scan like yeah but you

418
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,359
were supposed to go puppets

419
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:09,220
metasploit free learn how to use it

420
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,220
just do some of the scanning tools that
are in there

421
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:18,098
rawr it's pretty neat it will scan your
network and give you a nice little

422
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:22,359
printout of all the websites that finds
so just like a screenshot of everything

423
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:28,869
that finds its like sitting on port 80
or 443 on a range that you give it and

424
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:38,619
set social engineering tool kit is what
I used for fishing on users so everybody

425
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:42,039
groans when you talk about the appliance
nobody likes USA

426
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:47,140
nobody likes having to deal with PCI
HIPAA Sox whatever iso standard that you

427
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,210
have to comply with their not bad though
if you think about security first and

428
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:56,680
then like oh well because I did all of
this now i magically PCI compliant

429
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,509
because I followed everything you know
security-related I didn't just checking

430
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:06,759
off boxes i did was supposed to do
instead of you know what they thought

431
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:12,819
was the bare minimum to give I and
what's a great turns out to be a great

432
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:15,788
tool no matter where you're at is if you
have to comply with any of these

433
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:16,869
standards

434
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:22,960
yeah we we need this definitely because
it's that's required for our pci

435
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,059
certification by everything back to
compliance this i mean when you work

436
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:34,930
with Doctors tying that to an actual you
know money that they have to deal with

437
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:44,649
for HIPAA like they'll get onboard real
fast segmentation that whole web server

438
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:50,470
sequel thing could have probably been a
little bit better if you do with a dmz

439
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,480
so separating everything that's going to
be attacked from the internet from

440
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:03,069
everything on the inside the novel
concept setting up he lands don't just

441
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:09,150
put everything on the line one you don't
want to flat network setting up

442
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:13,950
Active Directory delegation of Rights so
just because you need your help us to

443
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:21,419
promote I'm sorry I promote it had no
computers to the domain doesn't mean

444
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,240
that they should have domain admin you
can do that with Active Directory

445
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,118
delegation and access control lists
between your vlans when you can't always

446
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:33,569
afford a firewall not gonna put a
firewall between every section your

447
00:41:33,569 --> 00:41:36,720
network acl's kind of makeup or when you
don't always need one

448
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:44,640
and finally to the part where you've
gotten all of this done it's all been

449
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,750
free you've been working for a year year
and a half two years 10 years

450
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:54,839
uh-huh and all of this free stuff you
can say look this is where we were this

451
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:59,788
is where we are now this stuff would
give us that extra boost to get that

452
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:07,170
much further in our security getting the
real vulnerability skeleton scanner at

453
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:16,230
this point not Sam IDs IPS that you
actually set up and configure just just

454
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,700
because something's you know all the
logs are going to it that's great but

455
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,788
you're not actually looking at it you're
not doing anything with it

456
00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:30,420
that's not going to do anything for you
yet she has a checkbox there he pay the

457
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,200
license

458
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,930
it's a it's on you know it's it's
collecting stuff that ought to get into

459
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:43,710
it i have some stories about that too
that i'm not willing to the futon on

460
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:48,569
camera and getting a professional
pentest at least once a year I know some

461
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,660
people that get a pen test monthly no
they're not

462
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,009
that's this is a pen test it gives you
this great pen test report at the end

463
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:06,089
and you know the difference between a
vulnerability assessment pentest usually

464
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:09,328
if you get the report and it's
everything that you found with your

465
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:12,450
vulnerability scanner you know that not
actually giving you what you're paying

466
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,109
for

467
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:16,259
i hear there's a great company that's
based in

468
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,930
northern Ohio that does pendant
penetration testing

469
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:31,470
no nobody heard of umpiring sorry
two-factor off is always going to cost

470
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:37,169
you something it's gonna be difficult to
implement but definitely necessary evil

471
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:43,440
users will complain there's no no
getting past that but you know with

472
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,880
adequate training whatever i'm accessing
internal systems from the internet

473
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,010
shouldn't just be 0 and not only to
factor off but setting it up correctly

474
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:58,380
so there's some software out there that
will just let you set it up you know the

475
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,180
two-factor off is them from the software
calling you back you answer and hit

476
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,129
pound alright so it's something you have
right technically it's two-factor off

477
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:13,590
our users got so used to it that even if
somebody else was logging in with your

478
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:19,830
username and password somewhere they'd
answer hit pound because I mean if it

479
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,640
it's from a phone number it's from a
phone number they recognize its

480
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,879
ingrained in there you know they're like
oh maybe it's something in the back end

481
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,100
that's doing it they have no idea that
that's I mean so technically it's two

482
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:41,310
factor auth right and advanced buzzword
cyber blinky boxes there's a shitton of

483
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:44,100
them out there whatever one that you
feel is going to provide the most

484
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,930
network next-gen I should have put
should've had a next-gen to that huh

485
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,709
oh I need to hurry up getting organized

486
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:03,510
I'm the whole gpo thing like I'm super
super anal about like hundred percent

487
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:09,150
everything right makes asset management
really difficult for me because i always

488
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:16,320
want to know everything like down to
collapse device IP address management

489
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:22,620
there's you know your it be great if
people just use DNS for that doesn't

490
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,400
always happen so there's some good
software out there . his an Excel

491
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,150
spreadsheet with boys adam in the ass

492
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:35,420
getting a password safe there's a bunch
out there that are free great paid

493
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:40,700
versions too i really like psychotic a
really good one like for larger

494
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:45,710
organizations you could do role-based
and release privileges for different

495
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:50,059
passwords different containers that kind
of stuff and they've really cool magnets

496
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:57,200
totally not to do with that incident
response tabletops these are super cool

497
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,069
will give you a lot of information about
how your organization works as a whole

498
00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:09,558
we had a customer do an instant response
one week the next week they got hit with

499
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:13,490
almost exactly what they were planning
on and what we did in the tabletop and

500
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,490
they still fuck stuff

501
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:22,430
yeah yeah but way less than they would
have if they wouldn't have done the

502
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:27,529
tabletop you know they changed a lot at
that point to you know who they need to

503
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:32,420
call what what processes they need to go
for the different situations that might

504
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,760
arise doing those giving everybody kind
of a practice isn't going to make it so

505
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,390
when it happens in real life they're
running around like crazy can't figure

506
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,098
out what to do who to call

507
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:49,700
whatever and not just tabletops doing
the drills to if you can I mean

508
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:55,549
sometimes there's a you no limitations
to drills that you can do depending on

509
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:59,930
dem you know what how much down time
that you can take and writing it all

510
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:07,160
down knowing exactly from from those
tabletops and from those drills keeping

511
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,520
it a procedure where everybody has
access to its you know what you're

512
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:17,538
supposed to do so this is good

513
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:21,020
a kind of just it's true right

514
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,868
if you could do all of this stuff to to
lock down your network you can have you

515
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:34,490
know rock solid but o going back to user
education if your users just up and give

516
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,779
up their password

517
00:47:35,779 --> 00:47:38,539
you're still on i mean you're still on
fire that users going to help that

518
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:41,220
little less percent

519
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,140
right well done questions

520
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:57,180
when's the book about you can buy it now
and if you find me i don't i only have

521
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,230
one left on me but i have coupons for
the book right now you can get it on

522
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:04,080
o'reilly website you can get it on
safari if you have a supportive

523
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:09,090
subscription and if you get it now that
you get the chapters as I come out

524

physical copy comes out March yes sir to
. something a 23 million devices still

525
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:31,230
run java and two million 999999
shouldn't be ya say thanks to lead you
