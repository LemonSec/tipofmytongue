1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
sure we're ready oh alright already

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,450
ok let us know when you're ready

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,149
all good okay awesome alright so real
quick

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,850
obviously obligatory disclaimer these
opinions are around don't reflect any

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,390
path previous or current or future
employee this isn't a bridge talk we put

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,949
together after about 18 months works
this is like crazy accelerated but one

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,050
in particular if you guys so I'm camera
crack i'm the vp of user experience and

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,468
product strategy macys.com my name's
Keith Conway I'm not user experience

9
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,520
consultant work with Cameron a lot of
help and slowly but I do a lot of you

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,989
explore different kind of groups and
this is kind of our experience on what

11
00:00:51,989 --> 00:01:00,239
we did at macys so they made the talk is
nobody gets fired for choosing IBM but

12
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,649
maybe they should so when I went to
business school in the eighties this was

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,540
a common thing that everybody told me
when i left school and actually started

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,320
work i heard this more and more which
always interested me because I always

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,359
kind of wondered why so in the fifties
as we now IBM kind of decided to send

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,080
sales people around the world to
essentially cell systems worldwide to

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,158
emerging companies large-scale fortune
500 companies

18
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:37,439
I'm and became this pervasive force in
business around the world and it solved

19
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,669
a bunch of unmet customer needed allowed
come companies to do things that they

20
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,100
had never been able to do before weather
is automating their P&L making inventory

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,570
highly available etcetera they were
doing this largely by implementing these

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,869
monolithic systems and at the time that
was innovative

23
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:03,360
as we warned on we started neglecting
customer need we've actually to some

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,598
degree made this a part of our corporate
culture and I've spent the last 20 years

25
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,459
of my career actually kind of cleaning
up after these giant IBM implementations

26
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:20,010
we're essentially at some point the
business actually isn't about serving

27
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,780
the customer anymore actually working
you know its primary goal it's actually

28
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,709
serving the Beast it's maintaining the
system it's becoming a culture of know

29
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,590
and it's essentially this endless
patchwork of what we can do based on

30
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,370
what the system will support at that
point innovation starts to become legacy

31
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,620
and the minute we start forgetting who
are customer is what they need the

32
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,620
business starts to die and ultimately
our legacy starts to kill us

33
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,510
so that's what we're really here to kind
of talk to you guys about it's not about

34
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,709
ivy and specifically any technological
innovation was an innovation because

35
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,170
it's solved on that customer needs
return about that you did something

36
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,450
valuable but over time your competitors
anybody else can do that because the

37
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,130
rate of change of technologies evolution
is just so fast right now so we're here

38
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,310
to talk more about how do you actually
save yourself from yourself as a large

39
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,769
corporation or larger organization and
two main things you need is solving on

40
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,410
that customer needs build a great
company like these are your kind of

41
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,609
mentality because a lot of talk about
social engineering red teaming kind of

42
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:26,910
these ideas that were folding you guys
all know about there's a lot of a

43
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,150
preconceived notions about its the
fairies to get living behavior they're

44
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,150
very specific kind of attacking vectors
that come to mind and in order to move a

45
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,600
large organization towards collective
action you need 12 which is the customer

46
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,920
a great company and then if you're not
returning value then you're not finding

47
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,518
a way to speed the innovation back to
keep it alive and then fourth you have

48
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,069
to do is without shutting the company
off because if you're like an oil and

49
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,138
gas company if you're a bank

50
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,579
you can't just stop and then forgive me
know make sure things can keep working

51
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,989
on that really is the brilliant trick
that IBM has kind of lock this all into

52
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,910
our business cease to exist even even
intraday if we should any of this stuff

53
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,609
down so we're locked in

54
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:13,580
so our goal today is to try and get you
guys as smart as possible as fast as

55
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,570
possible to kind of give you a framework
to use this on your own

56
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,630
hopefully you guys work for large
companies to you know to apply centers

57
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,140
on your own so the first thing i do is
assess the environment you going to

58
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,520
build a message to craft the message
find the right people and then it's all

59
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,070
about timing

60
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,340
so the first thing is assessing the
environments defining how and where the

61
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,390
technology is inhibiting you your
organization and kind of the larger

62
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,289
thing that you're after its kind of
going outside your four walls as well

63
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,590
and understanding what's going on in the
economic environment around you or the

64
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,030
market that you plan

65
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,479
I'm for us we plan a global market so we
have to look at this from around the

66
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,490
world what is the space retail doing in
this particular example I mean how is

67
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,330
the economic environment around us
actually affecting the business and then

68
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,550
finally it's kinda gave the culture and
deciding where the human factor is you

69
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:09,830
know again because this I
self-fulfilling prophecies to some

70
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,330
degree of servicing the system starts to
define how culture works is bringing

71
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,740
these things together understanding them
in describing them in ways that the the

72
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,720
human beings can actually understand so
you can break the thing down so real

73
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,830
quick

74
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,120
no matter what message you have the sea
level of the board they have to like get

75
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,020
behind it and everything to get behind
it you have to speak their language

76
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,380
which is your revenue profit loss p need
to understand what these things are

77
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,490
understand now we live in a global
market right now like it doesn't matter

78
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,940
what you do macro not macroeconomic
trends are going to affect you have to

79
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,880
be an MBA to kind of do this you know
enough to kind of speak the language

80
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,900
they listened to you when you know
you're actually talking which brings us

81
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,549
the right part so like we said the sea
level has to evangelize not just by if

82
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,030
you buy and then you're just like okay
hey we agree but they're not going to go

83
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,359
back and actually put on the earnings
calls are not going to put that back

84
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,120
down in the organization this is
basically just like an academic

85
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,479
experiment so we're actually gonna go
through some of the examples we have

86
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,599
later but we're going to give you the
framework right now so we did is we

87
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,780
built an org chart or telling you to do
is build an org chart do a threat

88
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,929
assessment certain people you can work
with starting collaborate would

89
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,520
certainly probably wanna go

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,659
or because they're going to see you as a
threat and then what you want to do is

91
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,949
plot you run across multiple domains in
parallel so it's not just one person you

92
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:31,400
want to kind of make you run through you
have to be able to go through find

93
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,000
partners in marketing merchandising
other different parts of the

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,520
organization that you can see ideas too
so that you're going to go up here and

95
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,549
even though they're going to take credit
for little ideas the whole rising tide

96
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,729
is going to float your boat like over
there that's the trick I mean everybody

97
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:50,120
kind of knows that when storming the
castle you're not getting the King

98
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,630
immediately you have to sort of work
with the levels that you're working with

99
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,280
so for us it was all about trying to
figure out what that level was like

100
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,080
Keith said that we could see the message
to kind of get our message up to the

101
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,500
king

102
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,620
so to speak I'm so timing is everything
and it is we're saying it it's that

103
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,340
proper seating of a particular part of
the message that you want to resonate

104
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,739
its building that common framework of
language for your entire audience it's

105
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,030
going broad it's looking across the
organization and deciding where your

106
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,750
friends are where your foes are and
seeing the appropriate message to each

107
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,560
of those groups and having that message
rise up and then once a common language

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,770
or a carrier waves developed its kind of
dropping the next part of the message

109
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:40,008
until your building that curiosity to
the point where eventually you're going

110
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:45,229
up continue to rinse repeat this the
curiosity sort of builds people begin to

111
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:49,310
understand this you start to have less
friction in the organization so that

112
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,310
means that you're having we're talking
about these concepts become more and

113
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,080
more fluid and then ultimately curiosity
builds to the point and you've hit

114
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,169
enough of the sort of key players in
your organization that you get the

115
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,169
invite to kind of come and talk to the
sea level person

116
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,340
alright so our process was kind of like
a random hodgepodge of social

117
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,060
engineering red teaming and design
thinking and for us we're using the kind

118
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,990
of definition that Chris had Maggie
Michelle Fincher kind of positive which

119
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,949
is essentially influencing people to
take decisions which they didn't think

120
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,070
or know they should or should not have
taken and

121
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:30,670
Chris and Michelle really in the apse
class made an awesome . about not losing

122
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,210
the teaching moment where if you're
tricking if you kind of if you're

123
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,600
trippin somebody are using kind of
nefarious behavior kind of manipulation

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,229
then someone's gonna catch that and it's
not going to be a lasting way to build a

125
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,990
relationship moving forward and as we go
back like this whole sparking curiosity

126
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:52,030
new people ideas in retail retail is
like a very technologically kind of

127
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,230
archaic and yeah mentality we're
literally stuck in the fifties right now

128
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,860
with mainframes and whatnot so giving
people the confidence to speak up and

129
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,330
ask questions without afraid to just be
wrong or not understand what's going on

130
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,620
allows them to actually participate
beyond just saying okay you do this you

131
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,090
do that I'm being very tactical and just
do this right now right so that's a

132
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,900
social engineering part the red teaming
is more state of mind for us and micah

133
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,130
zenko had a really good book about red
teaming you check it out and he kinda

134
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,600
posted that as like a state of mind also
how you just being devil's advocate and

135
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,330
that's what we're kind of doing we're
not being devil's advocate for sake of

136
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,170
being devil's advocate but trying to
really understand where the

137
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,870
opportunities lie for the customer that
business and how to actually feed that

138
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,920
back into the system and then our
background is in design that's where

139
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,910
design thinking comes from tim brown to
CEO of i do they did a design thinking

140
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,060
trying to put design in place so it
didn't exist before and that's kind of

141
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,560
home where we come from

142
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,630
so what we're gonna do now is go through
a handful of slides from our deck we

143
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,590
can't show you what we actually did for
the whole thing its proprietary

144
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,950
obviously but we're going to talk to
kind of just different different bits

145
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,570
and pieces can give you guys an idea

146
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,610
so when we build our deck like my
background came from a film sound and

147
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,600
special effect the major at savannah
college of art design so for me this is

148
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,000
kind of like a visual storyboard wrapped
up as a business plan and a strategic

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,200
vision for the company and the goal is
could the CEO and the board understand

150
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,870
what's going on but also get down to an
associate level employee who you might

151
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,350
have three kids and working multiple
jobs and not really care about the

152
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,480
finance at the company so as we talked
about earlier the main issue that we

153
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,600
kept running into the technology is in
heaven

154
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,720
bring the user experience that business
processes everything else that people

155
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
don't understand what's going on we
would have meetings where we installed

156
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,829
kiosks that would be you'd push the
kiosk and what nme it wouldn't even

157
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:50,910
slide and I'm like an Instagram for
somebody to work with and his kid is

158
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,360
standing in front of an LCD or a giant
TV screen and trying to swipe the screen

159
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,649
thinking it's like a giant iPad right
now so they didn't get the mental models

160
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:02,069
transferring through to all the
generations so we're like okay look in

161
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:06,540
10 years a phone is going to be as fast
as your brain has been less than a

162
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,009
thousand dollars and that's going to
absolutely change just everything right

163
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:15,000
now I mean think about we're living in a
time right now where the cycles and

164
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,680
evolution of Technology escalating so
fast that you can really see beyond the

165
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,880
horizon Ray Kurzweil talks about this
people singular university I mean timing

166
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,689
whatever is not really relevant but it's
just that the idea to get them to think

167
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,500
about technologies not just changing the
business is changing customer behavior

168
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,050
change society changing everything

169
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:40,469
secondarily we lost half our market
capitalization matters six months and to

170
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,339
a point where to hedge funds are trying
to do architect a hostile takeover

171
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,880
because a real estate was worth more
than what the stock is actually worth

172
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,029
and so we talked about this and you hear
about this morning's call when they

173
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,120
start listening and so we would
literally sit on their earnings call and

174
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,630
text back and forth and take notes and
then ask our bosses ask our bosses

175
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,019
bosses like what about this what's going
on here and you hear certain things

176
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,040
you're like how does the market actually
receive this is value and if they are is

177
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,089
this what are our board is actually
proceedings value as well and why is it

178
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:14,310
and again you know I'd be up at 2am
watching Bloomberg on my phone for i

179
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,959
passed out and it's like a quarter of
all gdp or economic output in the world

180
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,219
is a negative interest rate territory
and what that means is that i'm a bank

181
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,110
i'm giving you guys alone

182
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,120
that means i am paying you interest for
the benefit of taking a loan from me

183
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,949
which makes absolutely no sense
whatsoever and that is gorgeous comments

184
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:39,089
really crazy bizarre land with finance
and everything and that's that feeds

185
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:43,620
back to essentially how we get debt how
we pay for more expansion how we grow

186
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,000
the business

187
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,170
and again this is how you communicate
and things are actually important to the

188
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:56,069
top level so before we leave that the
fascinating thing about this is is we

189
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,920
got smarter about this we started to be
very predictive we introduce air within

190
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,250
the couple of days if anything was
happening globally we could predict

191
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,140
within probably about a point or two
what are in stock price could do

192
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,170
I'm so if we wanted to be in the various
we actually probably could have made a

193
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,740
lot of money doing that but between the
two of us we were actually predicting

194
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,530
where the stock was going to go before
the stock went there so the second thing

195
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,550
that we talked about in and coming out
we're showing you sort of in practice is

196
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:33,540
the message and again the message needs
to be bold it needs to be easily

197
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,640
understood and it kind of needs to be in
your face and we try to keep this and

198
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,949
you're seeing again these actual
tactical slides I'm the got our execs to

199
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:49,200
pay attention and it's literally like
look we are slaves to the machine we are

200
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,580
at this point Q managers and meanwhile
our customers daily are telling us about

201
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,420
these problems and we're ignoring them
and it was only at the point where you

202
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,610
can start to see these really bold
examples that you start to catch hold

203
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,800
right and again this is another example
one of the articles that i dread as we

204
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,260
were doing this was this idea about
English lawyers they still wear these

205
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,210
wigs in 2016 have done this for more
than a hundred eighty years

206
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,650
the bottom line is there's nothing in
any English law that says they need to

207
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,650
do this they just simply do it because
nobody told them to stop

208
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,540
it's a pretty good metaphor for what
goes on in a giant corporation and it

209
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,730
was like all right is everybody away
like can you hear me in the back

210
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,980
so once we know again kind of
established this carrier wave now it's

211
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,980
time to to load payload on

212
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:50,490
so this was we went through probably 15
20 different major passes of our deck

213
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,320
and our deck was always one slaw one
slide one idea and it was simple enough

214
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,100
so that if this land on somebody else's
desk they could just read through it

215
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,970
like someone's having a conversation
with them during lunch and be like oh ok

216
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,420
action like I can actually get this and
it wasn't this giant time of a

217
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,900
powerpoint just dance of all information
that no one really cares about and won't

218
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,000
read and won't retain later so we talked
earlier about having you know your title

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,180
your concept in seven or eight words and
this is one of the ones we came up with

220
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,420
which was like the new baseline
simplicity convenience and trust and

221
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,140
everything was always so complicated and
you always end up with these ideas of

222
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,500
self-preservation people working to get
funding to kind of potentially keep

223
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,540
their own part of the beat them working
and for us were like look it's really

224
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,230
really easy simplicity whereas if you
have an idea in your head it's one click

225
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,820
once y 1 action had done conveniences
like give someone their time back don't

226
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,990
make them searching we had issues and if
you look on any of the financial crisis

227
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,560
many blogs anything out about fashion
today in retail people can't find what

228
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,010
they want if they're in smaller towns
and their sizes that I don't correlate

229
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,319
with what they want and just won't
necessarily want to listen to the

230
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,640
customer and making people have to work
harder and trust this is not only the

231
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,180
security part here for that everyone
cares about but also are you being

232
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,540
consistent you actually gaining trust
from your users from a constituent see

233
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,310
from your base and it was really simple
it was the best customer experience wins

234
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,489
that was this is actually our whole
mantra and ironing your kind of funny

235
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,420
thing is we'll go to render meanings and
someone to say oh ok we'll talk to

236
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,660
somebody and they're like oh hey you
this implicit convenient trust people

237
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,439
okay cool i got to know you guys did
that like were yeah i mean i literally

238
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,510
just came from Cincinnati Ohio so I've
never been the Cincinnati Ohio before

239
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,230
for a company but i guess we have like a
giant corporate presence there and

240
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,350
amazingly somebody came into this
meeting that i was happy i was in

241
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,460
training all week and somebody I never
met before comes in and says exactly

242
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:47,370
what keith said and actually has the
deck was like how did you get this deck

243
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,750
I'm and it turns out that it's so
pervasive at this point in our company

244
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,070
that people

245
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,280
anybody who's a decision maker and at
some level across

246
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,189
kind of a wide swath of the the area
that were in is somehow going to copy

247
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,240
this deck

248
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,339
I mean it was fascinating in in the work
team that i was in there was somebody

249
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,050
who's been kind of it's an archrival but
arrival on the last six years of my

250
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:19,109
existence there and all of a sudden
she's just like Jackson the deck to I

251
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,469
get it it's it's good you think it's a
hundred slides right

252
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,600
ya think anybody really yeah it was like
okay she actually has the deck crazy on

253
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:35,399
but the sort of friction if you will
between us largely is kind of been

254
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,550
mitigated because everybody has this
understanding now we're no longer

255
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,510
working against one other it's like okay
we're on the simplicity and convenience

256
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,879
bar right securities on the trust part
there's no more what they what are we

257
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,520
saying how do we mean this what how does
it work

258
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,680
what do we do with it Mikey said again
we're kind of showing you techniques at

259
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,450
this point like we've kept things too
simple messaging eight words or less

260
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:08,010
right and these important concepts will
pause will have these visuals will go

261
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,010
through a bunch of different visual so
that everybody can get kind of their

262
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,770
understanding of it right what does it
mean the technology wasn't illegal

263
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,750
wasn't into privacy and we have visuals
that go with that we tailor these decks

264
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,550
so that everybody again has that common
framework of language but some sort of

265
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:30,870
concept that resonates with them so this
is like the second slide of our deck and

266
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:36,270
this was from the Arizona boneyard it's
actually an old hydrogen bomb or nuclear

267
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,920
bomb test positive yet called the
physics package though and then the text

268
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:47,520
is actually our kind of what our company
our brand is saying out to the world to

269
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,120
try and reboot our stock and it's like
okay we're gonna feed this back in the

270
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,800
system and it's a metaphor of ok we have
a huge is it to make it's not gonna be

271
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,190
easy as going to a little work and you
know but there's also a lot of power a

272
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,660
lot of opportunity I mean for us it's
like if your macy's is giant retailer

273
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,630
and it's what you do one kind of
e-commerce that you've done the mall so

274
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,030
the only thing to do anything more
interesting to do something bigger with

275
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,230
a lot more skilled a lot more

276
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,860
complexity and this really excites
that's really excited about this is can

277
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,590
we actually find a way to get people to
move this large Titanic or monolith

278
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,860
forward in a way that people like doing
the work that they're doing creating

279
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,330
good jobs you know

280
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,799
good good money for them value for the
business customers are psyched and this

281
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,010
is kind of you know again one of the
ways that kind of grab people's

282
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,970
attention to slide to the like what am I
looking at and it's a pleasure people

283
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,049
are wearing suits everyday not you know
it's not like a silicon valley kind of

284
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:44,490
startup kind of culture so we talked
about doing our org chart and common

285
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,910
threat assessment we literally sat down
one day had coffee and so we had a

286
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,990
blackout all the names for
confidentiality but we literally looked

287
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,630
at okay who's in our chunk of the
company right now not the whole thing at

288
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,010
was one John enchilada but ok here's
what we know he has been the longest on

289
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,400
one time with the threat assessment a
little bit yeah sure

290
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,000
so being essentially like i was saying
before what we did is we kind of looked

291
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,830
at everybody and decided who is an ally
who is a potential threat who needs to

292
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,449
be brought along and what is the trigger
point that they need to have to be

293
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,890
brought along right it's not just simply
a blanket message of okay this is what

294
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,840
we're doing you have no choice in this
matter

295
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,780
it literally is seating them with the
information the pivot point that's the

296
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,530
thing that they care about right because
it's not the people are lining up in

297
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,160
these companies and mindlessly doing
their job actually do care

298
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:43,049
it's just kind of fighting that . that
says do you care about this

299
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:49,379
yes great it's almost like human BFF the
thing about that's like it literally is

300
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:54,929
ok what is the point of of access

301
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:59,520
yeah well it's a lot of times is
reporting it a lot of times they were

302
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,290
breathing the same air for so long that
they couldn't see beyond their own small

303
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,470
piece of the puzzle and that they just
couldn't realize that there's actually a

304
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,559
simple solve with tech or if I actually
work with somebody else to do

305
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,860
attribution or whatever they can
actually not only solve their problem

306
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,590
but three or four other people's
problems and that's we start putting

307
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,649
this together with kind of multiple
people in parallel kind of push this

308
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,830
thing forward

309
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:29,110
and so lastly this is one thing that
we're shining and this is it it's a

310
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,189
humorous anecdote but again once you get
to that point where people are listening

311
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,940
you need to make sure that they really
understand what the message was because

312
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:43,269
at some point when you're dealing with
the high pair up extra lines of your

313
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:47,500
organization they're gonna assume that
they know more than you do on so we

314
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,429
research the daylights out of most of
our use case it isn't this was one that

315
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:55,929
was one literally hilarious but it
actually was challenged by the chief

316
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:02,260
omni-channel officer and ultimately the
CEO of our company around both inventory

317
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,750
and availability and essentially it was
like this thing's been available for six

318
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,940
years it's been sitting on a shelf

319
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:15,370
actually there are six of them that were
sitting on a shelf for six years on the

320
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:20,139
the hilarious thing was we spent money
to actually search engine optimize this

321
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:23,080
and we spend money to search engine
market that so you could find this

322
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,168
through google and then we're on the
call talking about this and the chief

323
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:32,440
omni-channel officers essentially like
now this is not true it's like any you

324
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,600
can hear the keys moving right he's
googling and he's like David Cameron and

325
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,330
then it's like yeah but this is this is
one of those things we would ship

326
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,809
directly from a vendor we don't happen
like you're you're not thinking about it

327
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:50,889
right way and the essentially the chief
customer experience officer calls out

328
00:22:50,889 --> 00:22:59,500
it says it's in stock it says you can
pick it up in store was like geez so

329
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:07,179
candid sort of give us that . so the
next time he was in San Francisco and I

330
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:11,019
was handing him the books that were on
Keith reading list I made sure that he

331
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:21,250
had the bookmark actually the other the
other four are right in my office so

332
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:26,380
other execs will be getting these as
well but it but it does really kind of

333
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,159
Hammer that point home right it's a very
physical tangible example of something

334
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,770
that you can you can bring forward to
say

335
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,770
it really is this way it's a wake-up
call

336
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:43,840
yeah so this was the last slide of our
deck is kind of full circle from the

337
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,100
beginning Dec we started with the bunker
buster and the kind of brand cool it is

338
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,870
aware but on this actually works because
for us our goal was to try to figure out

339
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,679
how do we pick the corporate strategy
and would approve that is that if they

340
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,560
talked about on the earnings call and
they actually did that and the last

341
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,340
earnings call the stock went up i think
between three or six dollars which is if

342
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,840
you do the math in stock price and how
many outstanding shares it's almost like

343
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,060
1.5 1.8 billion dollars a market cab
which isn't which isn't all of us but

344
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,710
the things we did got to them and they
actually put on the earnings call so it

345
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:22,060
works and then now it's like okay the
next thing for us is that now the CEO

346
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,020
said yes

347
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,840
how do we actually get them to do it and
keep moving forward because it's a

348
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,649
hundred and sixty thousand person
company that's still trying to move

349
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,940
ahead in the future and that's our talk

350
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:45,490
thank you guys and not that I'm trying
to stick at the IBM but one one more

351
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,120
thing

352
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,709
so one of the questions that we got
asses we were talking about this is how

353
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,530
pervasive is this problem is this really
every you know large companies problem

354
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:01,840
this is actually from IBM itself for the
system z which is the precursory it's

355
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,959
the you know semi current version of the
system that they developed in the

356
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:13,240
sixties which were actually running is
401 and you can see right here 22 of the

357
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,690
top 25 us retailers are still on system
z 71 percent of the global fortune 500

358
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,280
companies are running system z eighty
percent of the world's corporate data

359
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:33,850
resides were originates in system z so
it's it really is that pervasive thanks

360
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,590
thanks guys

361
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,550
it's true

362
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,330
the problem is if you're running that
the blade in a single data center and

363
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,610
i'm not saying that we're doing that but
redundancy might be a bit of a problem

364
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,120
system
