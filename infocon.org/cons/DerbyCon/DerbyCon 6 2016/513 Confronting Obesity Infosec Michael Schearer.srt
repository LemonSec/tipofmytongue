1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,259
up in two different states for booz
allen hamilton as a government

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,210
contractor for the department of defense
also ran my own business for a couple of

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,670
years and then I decided I was going to
go to law school so I went to law school

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,039
finished and this past May took the bar
exam in July still waiting on the

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,840
results by work for dla piper which is a
law firm in DC and I do cybersecurity

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,140
law so data breaches and all that kind
of fun stuff we do really anything to do

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,980
with the technology and cybersecurity so
that's me

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,599
so this is also me I 13 months ago

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:51,059
this is a month before der beek on last
year 340 palace and eating a cupcake

10
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:59,399
apparently visit my family reunion last
summer and yeah you can see i was i was

11
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:09,030
what the doctors would call morbidly
obese means really bad so that's me

12
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:18,030
so why am i qualified to talk about OBC
i'm not i'm not a doctor I'm not a nurse

13
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,830
I'm not a trainer

14
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,130
I'm not a fitness I don't do fitness I
don't do any of that stuff i don't know

15
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,079
i'm not qualified to talk about any of
this stuff so what that means is if I

16
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,220
get what I'm here to tell you this is
what worked for me it may not work for

17
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,280
everybody but I'm trying to give you a
little bit of the basics that I've

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,600
learned over the past year maybe you can
take some of that and apply it to your

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:51,179
circumstances so what's this talk not
about I'm not here to shame you

20
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,229
if you're overweight I'll shave myself
I've got a lot of fat pictures of myself

21
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:01,920
in here and that's for me I all use
myself as the example there's a lot of

22
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,430
other things you may hear there's a lot
there's people out there that will tell

23
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,190
you that OBC is not linked to your
health

24
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,510
how many of you really believe that I'll
get to that later on them in the top

25
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,829
what this talk is not

26
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,510
this talk is not meant to send you back
to your room and say oh my God my life

27
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,310
is over this talk is to really hopefully
will inspire you to take this and

28
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,060
whether you whether you're the obese
person or not hopefully this will

29
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,050
inspire you to help yourself or help
others are your family

30
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,240
this is me last year at Derby County my
friends was driving and saw me took

31
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:49,620
picture probably 325 pounds at that
point I just I i had just been on my

32
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,860
program which I'll talk about for about
a month so probably you have that 30 or

33
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,470
25 pounds walking around so what's this
talk about we'll talk a little bit about

34
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,780
obesity will talk about the survey that
i did at the infosec community we will

35
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,410
talk about challenges to losing weight
because there are a lot of challenges

36
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,070
and then we'll talk about solutions
because a lot of the things that are

37
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,609
challenges you could turn them around
and turn them into solutions and that's

38
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,520
what that's really what we want to focus
on

39
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,340
so what are medical issues associated
with obesity these are all things that

40
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,239
are not necessarily caused by obesity
but they could they are associated with

41
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,160
and if you have if you're obese have a
higher risk of all these things heart

42
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,910
disease stroke high blood pressure
diabetes cancer gallbladder this

43
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,840
gallbladder disease osteoarthritis Scout
sleep apnea asthma

44
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:47,040
I've had as my life i still have sleep
apnea and had it for 15 years I had high

45
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,239
blood pressure

46
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,769
I was borderline diabetic all these
things

47
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:59,820
there's also discrimination if you're
obese you're probably the chances are

48
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,410
you have been discriminated against you
may not have gotten an interview or a

49
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,390
job your salary could be lower because
you're obese this discrimination in

50
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,738
healthcare some doctors will treat you
because you're obese that doesn't make

51
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:14,700
any sense really

52
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,108
right obesity is actually it is
classified as a disease but the doctors

53
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,029
will say I'm sorry we don't treat you in
the

54
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,419
until you lose wing it doesn't
necessarily help

55
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,320
there's also discrimination in education
and red relationships and this is the

56
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,139
kind of thing that you see outfit visit
tweet says dear obese PhD applicants if

57
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,630
you didn't have the willpower to stop
eating carbs you won't have the

58
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,490
willpower to your dissertation

59
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:50,880
ok so the survey i wrote a survey I it
was not meant to be scientific so I just

60
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,310
send it out and said hey everybody who
wants to respond go ahead i expected

61
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:02,460
maybe a hundred people to respond i got
760 responses so it was designed to be

62
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,150
short it's just 10 questions there's
five questions that are essentially

63
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,859
demographic male-female how long have
you worked in the industry etc and then

64
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,020
five questions about obesity and so I
wanted to get into the responses some of

65
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,139
the things were things that I expected
to see and somewhere not necessarily

66
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,260
what i expected to see again it's not
scientific but it should give you a

67
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,300
snapshot here's the demographic
seventy-six percent of the respondents

68
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,300
were between 25 and 26 and 45 89% mail
as should be no surprise

69
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,900
so almost seventy percent had at least a
college degree or an advanced degree now

70
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,159
will blind you with the white nearly
eighty percent of the responses says

71
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,090
their job is mostly sedentary how many
of you have a job it's mostly sedentary

72
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,869
you sit behind the desk maybe you get up
and walk for the printer

73
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,229
yeah I kind of expected this

74
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:05,700
how frequently do you travel this
actually surprised me i thought it would

75
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,490
be a little bit higher and here we found
about 75% almost done it don't travel at

76
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,800
all but there is some people that travel
quite a bit so so what does this have to

77
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,280
do with obesity that we though the
sedentary makes sense

78
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,419
you're not active travel has to do with
you know you're eating out of airports

79
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,340
eating a lot of food that you know you
just gotta grab it go and it's

80
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,340
convenient but it's not necessarily good
for you obviously

81
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:42,190
so this is this was a question of just
asking people how do you feel about your

82
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,530
current weight so 45% people classified
themselves whether they were actually

83
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,539
are not classify themselves as
overweight another seventy percent

84
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,710
classify themselves as obese so over
sixty percent of people infosec

85
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:02,830
community are at self-admittedly
overweight or obese thirty-five percent

86
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:12,400
or so about normal and a few people
underweight things that people are doing

87
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,760
to improve their health care to lose
weight healthy at the top answers

88
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:25,810
healthier foods portion sizes cardio and
strength-training dieting etc we'll get

89
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,870
into some of these because some of these
are definitely good some days are better

90
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,460
than others and then the last question
was what are the things that are keeping

91
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,109
you from losing weight and there's three
that stand out stress lack of energy and

92
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,430
busy schedule and these are all things
that probably you can't do anything

93
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:47,620
about so I'll get some examples of how
you can use your schedule to benefit you

94
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,760
instead of to hurt you

95
00:07:48,760 --> 00:08:01,000
so there are a lot of challenges to
fighting OBC lifestyle challenges how

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,220
many how many of you have done what you
call a diet and it was two weeks or a

97
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,450
weekend or six weeks but then at the end
of it you just went back to what you

98
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,840
were doing before how many of you have
done that a lot of fudge bunch of people

99
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,940
have done that I talked about doctors
there are doctors that won't treat

100
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,820
people because they're obese and then
there's doctors who will say you go in

101
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,159
either a friend who had a problem with
an ankle and she went to the doctor and

102
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,840
the doctor just harped on her about her
weight and she's like I'm here for my

103
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,600
ankle so doctors can can actually be
attributed to challenge for you in more

104
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,590
than one way

105
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,400
some will say we don't treat you if
you're obese and someone will focus too

106
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,410
much on it so doctors

107
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,399
so you would think that there's some
sort of a little bit of uniformity with

108
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,730
medical the medical profession about how
to deal with a VC there is not theirs

109
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,199
both extremes friends and family can be
a challenge

110
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:03,849
how many of you have either been on the
receiving end for of said to a friend

111
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,620
you know

112
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,060
oh you're a little weight but you look
fine you just big bone or you look fine

113
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,060
you look good it's not that bad

114
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,949
so your friends can if you're the OPC
roadway person your friends do this

115
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:23,469
directly enabling you and they're
reinforcing their actually reinforcing

116
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,449
some of the issues that you might
already have

117
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:31,029
I've been too i was told many times oh
440 pounds level 340 pounds if you don't

118
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,730
look at that and I know they're trying
to help you

119
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,589
they really are but they can depend upon
how you think about it could be holding

120
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:40,660
you back

121
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,430
one of the things that people talked
about in the question in getting the

122
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,810
comments to my responses were things
that were holding people back where I

123
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,349
didn't mention medical issues or
physical issues and this is definitely

124
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,310
true

125
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,388
some people have physical issues that
prevent them from doing certain types of

126
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,920
exercise some people have genetic issues
or other medical issues so this is a

127
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,240
thing I mean obviously it does help it
does prevent people on

128
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,949
however I've seen this before where
people will do a diet for a month and

129
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:16,359
they won't lose any weight and I think
well I must have XYZ and then they give

130
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,529
up you can't do that that's not enough i
also want to talk about other challenges

131
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:28,180
there is a a study of people who have
you guys are either heard of seeing the

132
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,439
show the biggest loser people going to
show they lose lots of weight real fast

133
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:35,589
they did a study of people who are on
the show

134
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:40,029
seven years after they were on the show
and what they found was that the

135
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,449
contestants had gained back seventy
percent of the weight that they had lost

136
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:47,439
on the show so is good then kept thirty
percent of it off but they had gained a

137
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:52,509
lot that I and what the problem is is
that they have lost so much weight so

138
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:58,000
fast the thermostat ilysm when they got
to let sit let me use myself as an

139
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,520
example because i'm actually had

140
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,870
same issue as some of the people on the
show I was 30 or 40 pounds and I went

141
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:11,890
down to about 190 200 so I lost almost a
hundred fifty pounds my metabolism

142
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:18,699
because i lost weight so fast metabolism
at 190 pounds was slower metabolism of

143
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,840
someone who is normally been out under
90 pounds so my body is fighting it

144
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,890
my body is trying to fight to get back
to a heavier weight so that's the

145
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,340
problem that these people are having
it's called persistent metabolic

146
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,240
adaptation and it's a real problem is
the challenge this is why people who

147
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:42,700
lose weight and gain of that if there's
one slide that you take out of my

148
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,310
presentation let it be this one this is
the solution to losing weight and it's

149
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:55,510
math and it's an equation a plus B minus
C equals D and I will go through each of

150
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,890
the variables here you will understand
easy and then i will i will make it even

151
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:05,470
easier i'll make it down to two words a
is active calories

152
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:12,880
this is everything that you do other
than it being alive you walk run you

153
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,500
swim you lift weights you mow the lawn
all this is active calories be is your

154
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,230
BMR your basal metabolic rate this is
the calories that you burn by being

155
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,230
alive if you don't if you laid in bed
all day

156
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,430
these are the calories that you burn it
is determined by your age or sex and

157
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,540
your current weight

158
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,719
most people are somewhere around 2,000
calories that's why they say 2000

159
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:45,430
calories but it can it varies when you
are 340 pounds your BMR will adjust so

160
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,260
that I when I was 30 to 40 pounds might
be a barley over 3,000 calories and then

161
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:57,610
as you lose weight your BMR will adjust
see calories from food this is what

162
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,420
you're eating

163
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,319
how do you know what you're eating you
have it if you do want to do this you've

164
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,520
got to track everything

165
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,340
this means scanning barcodes all day
everyday everything if you guess how

166
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,650
much you're eating you're guessing wrong

167
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,630
most people are off by fifty percent

168
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:19,060
in portion sizes and the number of
calories that reading and and d is

169
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:25,540
deficit so here we go to most important
words caloric deficit if you want to

170
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,290
lose weight

171
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,630
that's the only way to do it there's no
there's no special science there's no

172
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:37,270
special diet there's no special foods if
you have a caloric deficit and all you

173
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,410
eat is junk food you will lose weight if
it may not be the healthiest thing

174
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,709
healthiest thing to do for you but you
will lose weight if you eat McDonald's

175
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:56,290
every day but you have a caloric deficit
you lose weight solutions again if you

176
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,660
call it a diet it here it's not gonna
work

177
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,660
it's a lifestyle change I know it sounds
cliché but it really is

178
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,730
doctors can't help you but you have to
explain to them what your goals are

179
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,610
I went to my doctor I explained my goal
and i work with her to develop a plan to

180
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,170
do what I was trying to do and then
every month she would brag to the other

181
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:23,620
doctors but she was relatively junior
doctor and she had the ability to I know

182
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,160
she didn't actually was set in her ways
so your doctors can help you but you

183
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,120
have to explain what you need from them
friends and family there are a lot of

184
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,330
people in this community in this room
who can help you

185
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,770
they may not be overweight they may be
people who are in groups or other things

186
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,449
as a group on in that many of us are in
on facebook it's called body hackers its

187
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,300
people who are losing weight is $OPERAND
people who are trying to gain muscles

188
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,640
people who are weightlifting and it is
its people who are doing the same thing

189
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,230
as you they're not going to mock you for
posting a picture of what of your before

190
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,990
and after as a matter of fact they're
probably going to celebrate you for

191
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,410
doing that sort of thing if you're the
kind of person that needs help from

192
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,640
other people

193
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,910
we're not going to do it for you but
they will help you so if you look on

194
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,540
facebook any less you can find me or
others as a group called body hackers

195
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,439
look for it

196
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,190
technology can help you there is a
number of apps out there you can have a

197
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,420
Fitbit or some kind of watch or
something that tracks your steps

198
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:27,219
these things are not going to do it for
you they're not going to

199
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,759
you help you lose weight what they will
do is they will tell you what you're

doing and they will help you set goals
and helpless stay you know if you ask me

201
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,819

202
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:43,029

204
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,610
help you

205
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:54,220
this app right here myfitnesspal I I
don't endorse apps but that is the best

206
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,230
app right there you scan it will tell
you you scan barcodes on food that will

207
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,589
tell you everything will tell you
calories will tell you everything you

208
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:05,980
want to know you have food that that
doesn't have a barcode one ninety-nine

209
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,459
percent from we have a barcode on United
stuff you buy at the store you can

210
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:12,008
actually try you want to track what you
eat you can do it

211
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:19,810
lastly my friend Nathan right here with
the glasses on sitting here in the

212
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,930
fourth row he's giving a talk radio
handy

213
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:27,040
he's giving a talk tomorrow in track for
all body hacking 101

214
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,000
I i assume he's gonna going to talk
about some of the same things I've

215
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,809
talked about here but he's going to talk
about it more and so I encourage you to

216
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:39,430
go to that why does this matter

217
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,509
got a few minutes left here's my picture
eating a cupcake

218
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:55,029
this is me uh about six months later at
the force awakens debut 340 pounds

219
00:16:55,029 --> 00:17:03,699
sedentary sedentary 190 pounds inactive
in six months six months you like 250

220
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:09,879
problem six months i did ok let me get
the driver that now i showed you i

221
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,449
showed you one slide and I said I wanted
you to remember the two words caloric

222
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:19,120
deficit I want you to remember one more
number the difference between those two

223
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:33,039
numbers 12 years the average lifespan of
someone of this and this 12 years that's

224
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:33,970
it

225
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:39,880
questions can I ask another number
please

226
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,549
the reverse when you last remember when
you were young and fit how long did it

227
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:50,770
take how to have the creep up along that
happen very slowly very smooth off

228
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,090
that's what you meant for years

229
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:57,309
oh ya know the 12 years 12 years is ben
is that it is the difference between the

230
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,940
average lifespan have someone at those
different weights

231
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,169
yeah so what he's asking is how long is
that how long was it to get in the way

232
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:11,620
oh it's very slowly and it's you know if
you gained it as fast as I lost it you

233
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,330
definitely notice it when you get it one
pound a month over 10 years you don't

234
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,080
notice it just like I'm getting older I
just got to get new clothes I gotta get

235
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,149
2x and said 1x I gotta get 3x and set up
to our you don't notice it when you get

236
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:31,210
when you get that first that's long was
your calorie intake I understand the

237
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,159
calorie deficit for everything but what
your calorie in um so during the six

238
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,630
months when i was on my way about 1,500
calories a day fourteen fifteen hundred

239
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,789
a day that's pretty low

240
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:48,760
I mean I feel bad feeling hungry no not
at all not hungry at all is what you

241
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,299
choose

242
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:54,460
yeah um i would save my choice I was not
focusing on specific kinds of food

243
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:01,330
mostly portion sizes and and choosing
foods of lower calories so instead of

244
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,939
just keep trying to find like food where
you can get a lot of nutrition out of

245
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,539
the smaller like chicken like chicken

246
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:14,379
everybody hates chicken because it's
such a great food for for this type of

247
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:25,450
thing but really it's yeah i have not I
have not you please repeat the question

248
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:35,350
his question was a book called packard
losing weight your stress and

249
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,459
malnutrition i'm not sure that it's so
what

250
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,390
just just to sort of outlet add on to
that point i want to show you that what

251
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,870
i did is not necessarily the best way or
the right way to do things

252
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:52,070
probably lost weight too fast i know
that sounds weird but my metabolism is

253
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:59,089
still a little screwy it's my weight
fluctuates a lot based on every day and

254
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:03,229
now my talking about water weight i'm
talking about because my body is still

255
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:14,989
trying to figure out where to be at so
yeah regular workout or how short so ah

256
00:20:14,989 --> 00:20:20,599
yes so what I do is I build and this
goes into my schedule I'm as busy as

257
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:25,458
everybody i just took the bar exam in
july so I was a study for the bars and I

258
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:32,089
build walking into my day so I ride the
train from Baltimore to DC I get to the

259
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:35,089
train station 15 minutes before the
train i want for 15 minutes

260
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:40,940
I ride the train instead of I red train
to DC I walk a mile and a half of my

261
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,570
office i'll take a break in the morning
I walked so it's spread out over the

262
00:20:44,570 --> 00:21:00,769
dead definitely some point usually tough
if 20-30 minutes at a time like you I

263
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:04,249
think it's different for everybody i did
this is I had a goal of getting below

264
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:10,099
200 but that wasn't necessarily the my
that was just the number my motivation

265
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:16,428
on soon as my kids I want my kids to
have a dad that's around for a while so

266
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:19,879
I think it's whatever motivates you

267
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:23,389
you know I mean it's going to be
different for everybody

268
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:33,790
my hind legs and back yet

269
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,170
whatever right everyone everyone it has
a different thing and I think you should

270
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,670
take it and run with it you know my
thing my idea here is not to make

271
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,920
everybody walking 12 miles a day if you
if you run if you swim whatever you do

272
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,720
whatever you do too

273
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,560
there's two things that the BMR in that
calculation you can't do much about

274
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,520
right

275
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,080
it's it is what it is but you can change
is active calories and you can change

276
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:05,980
your intake and that will change that is
the map for the deficit other questions

277
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,220
I will be around until monday if you
have questions about things you've tried

278
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,960
things you've done

279
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,260
I'm happy to talk to you about it

280
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,930
thank you for coming to talk everybody
enjoy the rest of your weekend
