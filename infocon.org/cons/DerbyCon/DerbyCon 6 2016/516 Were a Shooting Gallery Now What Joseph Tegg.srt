1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,069
alright guys sorry about the technical
difficulties so I have under the talk

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,540
this morning obviously after Redman
Method Man last night which this kind of

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,928
a rough schedule so I appreciate all of
you for actually getting up this morning

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,309
to roll in here

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,960
even my teammates because we're one
moose but anyway so I'm doing a talk on

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,080
related to vulnerability management were
shooting gallery now what

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,939
evolving from a tactical checklist
response to a proactive strategic

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:36,930
process and that's what I'm doing so
let's get into it right there you go

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,219
so Who am I i I'm a senior security
consultant for rapid seven an

10
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,329
information technology for a little over
20 years i have a unix system

11
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:51,600
administration background i started out
with basically i was working at isp as a

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,110
dial-up technician so I don't know if
you guys been around long enough to

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,620
understand what that is but it some of
the old school guys know what that is

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,010
basically you tell people that have
windows 312 reboot so that they can

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,039
connect to the internet so i started out
there and there's unix system

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,090
administrator that was there that ran
the shell server because it used to hand

17
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,470
out shelves which whoa that's awesome
right that so these two hand ourselves

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,920
back in the day and I told him I wanted
to learn unix and he said okay no

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,900
problem so we set up a freebsd box and
said if you can get root I'll teach unix

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,140
and so he gave me a shell and I started
playing around learned it got root and

21
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,020
two weeks because i was a windows guy
and so basically his goal was if you can

22
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,179
learn unix in two weeks to get root you
can learn unix in general right so so

23
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,899
anyway I'm just an average Joe right I
didn't drop a zero and dropping all day

24
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,600
yesterday but what I do have is I have
like a huge passion around security and

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
around vulnerability management in
general because I come from the system

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,589
ministration background and I care about
protecting the systems and this is not

27
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,030
going to work

28
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,030
so I'm going out so what do we see
basically what I see and what I have

29
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,860
seen in my roles as a vulnerability
management specialist and also my

30
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,000
security consultant role is that we get
these pen test reports that come back to

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,870
the vulnerability management teams and
they come from third parties they come

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,459
from internal red team's they come from
internal testing teams and these reports

33
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,819
come back and they come to management
first their executives they come to

34
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,410
management and they come to use the
vulnerability management guy and the

35
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,400
perspective that set on these reports is
pretty interesting and the reason is

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,050
because we hire these people or we have
these internal teams to find our holes

37
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,400
right to find the bugs and find the
issues within our systems and so that's

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,180
since that's their job they make a show
of it that's what they do

39
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,959
I mean they don't come in and say oh hey
you know I found this one vulnerability

40
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,989
it was really cool you go check it out
now what they do is they coming to say I

41
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,970
got root my own you and I took over for
your systems and I got this pci data so

42
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,250
they make a show out of it and so it
creates this this perspective of the

43
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,780
reports in the findings report that
looks a lot like this right

44
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,250
ask you look up and you say this is the
report it's awful right we're gonna die

45
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,640
there's holes everywhere and so because
of that you get this response that

46
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,600
doesn't necessarily lineup with good
security because it's a knee-jerk

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,680
reaction right it's just like if
somebody has a trauma issue to get you

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,650
going to try to fix the trauma but you
forget that the guys got cancer too

49
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,880
right i mean so you forget the other
items that are related because you're so

50
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,470
focused on these single bullet holes so
what are some of the common test

51
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,540
findings that get a lot of attention and
we can default passwords

52
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,810
that's a big one right but guess what
they exist and they're everywhere

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,709
that's reality there's very few places
that i have gone in my roles everywhere

54
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,940
that I have not found we can default
passwords throughout the enterprise

55
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,440
there it's there they exist one open ftp
another big one printers supply these

56
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,810
right so there's a lot of devices out
there that come with ftp built-in and

57
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,630
it's usually open

58
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,738
allow anonymous access open files
there's another one that's very common

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,050
luckily the you know because of Windows
but obviously windows has started to

60
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,610
mitigate some of that so by default
they're not sharing files but users are

61
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:35,350
still really able to share out files on
file shares an old critical

62
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,380
vulnerability this one is near and dear
to my heart as a vulnerability

63
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,140
management specialist uh I hated seeing
the show up on a pin test report right

64
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,770
because of my company said something was
a critical vulnerability it's supposed

65
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,560
to be gone right it's supposed to be
it's not supposed to be in our

66
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,970
environment especially for larger more
mature programs that spin up special

67
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,650
project strictly to get rid of a single
vulnerability you still find them later

68
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,780
and a pen test report why so network
segmentation vulnerability I included

69
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,380
this because a lot of people forget that
vulnerability management is not just

70
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,460
about patching it's about managing all
vulnerabilities within the enterprise

71
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,080
that you're working in and segmentation
vulnerabilities is an architecture

72
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,229
vulnerability it's still a vulnerability
though because it allows people to

73
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,370
traverse vlans they shouldn't be
traversing or networks or firewalls or

74
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,430
things of that nature so I included
because I wanted to kind of remind

75
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,780
people in vulnerability management that
it's not just about patch right there's

76
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,739
other things involved in mobility
management so what are the common

77
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,810
pentest finding responses so in my
experience I have found there to be

78
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,660
three common responses and the executive
response is always my favorite because

79
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:52,450
this is what they do is that they get
that huge pentest find a report that's

80
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,080
like this thick on their desk and they
start looking at all the data because i

81
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,260
always take a screenshot of like credit
cards and her out the credit card

82
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,800
numbers and then they always take a
screenshot of user IDs of system

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,150
administrator password hey so they they
have all of this and they presented to

84
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,270
the executive and the first thing the
executive does at least that I've seen

85
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,109
right the executives I've dealt with
they just there like oh really

86
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,890
we're gonna die i do legal now I have to
talk to legal about getting ready for an

87
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,539
attack because we're going to obviously
get hack and you know they sometimes

88
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,800
sometimes the ones that I've dealt with
they have forgotten that we can do this

89
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,169
we can this is ok these vulnerabilities
have existed for

90
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:34,669
creative time this report is here to
tell us what Boehner abilities we have

91
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:38,930
so that's ok they're going to find stuff
that's what we pay them to do the

92
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,400
management response underneath the
executives is because my executive is

93
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,068
freaking out i need to take this list
and fix everything on it really fast and

94
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,729
so what they get into as they get into
this mindset of a checkbox list they

95
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:57,050
take that finance report they drop it
into an Excel spreadsheet or a microsoft

96
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,949
project right and they literally just
start going off and market them off the

97
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:04,189
line because they want to go back to
their executive and say we fix those we

98
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:09,889
fix those issues operations team
responds now I can say this because i

99
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:17,210
was on operations so it's don't ask me
I'm just the admin right so even though

100
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,138
i was really involved in security and
had a lot of passion around security

101
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:26,689
being a unix administrator for 15 years
I realize that the people around me were

102
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:31,430
quite as passionate about security and
so this was actually a common response

103
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,020
even when i was working in unix
administration and I always had a

104
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,680
problem with this response so i'm
actually working on some other stuff to

105
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,849
talk about that and deal with operations
people too so but anyway so this is a

106
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:48,199
common response that I dealt with is
that don't ask me I'm not security you

107
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,029
just tell me what to do right so how
about something that's a little bit

108
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,199
different from that

109
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:57,199
let's let's look at something that's a
different approach

110
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,270
let's not just check the boxes right
let's not just take that list and just

111
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,870
go one vulnerability a time on one asset
that's that's not the way we need to

112
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,649
handle this

113
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:11,689
so what do we do we should review the
findings so step back take a look at the

114
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:15,020
list take a look at the report and just
review them go through them and take a

115
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,529
look at them at a higher level to find
the vulnerability types that you see so

116
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:24,680
take a look at the report and say okay
look at this one is this type of

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,129
vulnerability this one is this type of
vulnerability this one is this type of

118
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:32,329
vulnerability when you do that you're
starting to classify and remove the

119
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:36,348
tactical and go into strategic because
now you're now you're taking it up a

120
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,010
level right and you're going to be able
to take a look at it more holistically

121
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,010
and you're going to be able to remediate
this at a higher level

122
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,480
so yes actually so in the pen test
reports this is this is one of the

123
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,550
things that that I've experienced i love
the third-party pentest especially

124
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,199
because they do this they come in and
they do the strategic and they they list

125
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,760
out each of those right and they say hey
this is this type of thing but what i

126
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,530
have found to be the the response to
that is that they don't stay in the

127
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,850
strategic right not the the pen test the
pin test reports always present that

128
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,700
right they always present that they
always say you should look across your

129
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,000
enterprise right they tell you that but
they tell you that after they presented

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,840
the findings and what happens is people
get stuck on the findings right they

131
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,750
just right they just literally dead bolt
right there

132
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,920
I can't go any further and so sometimes
they don't respond in the way that the

133
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,790
pen testers tell them to but as the
vulnerability management team the one

134
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,099
that's doing the response to these tests

135
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,360
that's our job is to help keep those who
get those executives on track right and

136
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,360
that's also our job to keep our
management on track so that we do look

137
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,170
at those pen test findings and so and
sometimes we have a red team operation

138
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,790
right so i was working at a corporation
it's pretty big and we had our own red

139
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,670
team and in the red team responds they
did not have a process to do this

140
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,750
it was single findings and so that again
that's a vulnerability management thing

141
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,300
okay look you're giving me single
findings but we really need to take this

142
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,130
up to another level

143
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,050
good question so then let's identify
these vulnerability instances so what I

144
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,219
mean by that is obviously the pen test
report and the red team operation finds

145
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,360
them on single assets right but our job
is vulnerability management is to take

146
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,810
that up to the next level and say where
does this exist in the enterprise we

147
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,300
should be looking for this everywhere
right

148
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,520
and then finally of course you put it
into the life cycle of the vulnerability

149
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,300
management program so sometimes what
you'll find is that you need to actually

150
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,969
have separate reporting related to
findings from the red team operation or

151
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,600
from that third-party pen test because
you're gonna want to deb out those

152
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,840
vulnerabilities and you don't want to
talk about those responses so you'll

153
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,830
find that you want to look for those
again because they're gonna that's

154
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,830
what's gonna happen you're gonna get
another question especially six months

155
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,020
later when that put that third-party
test comes back

156
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,410
and to do the pen test and are we
prepared for them right

157
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,709
did we did we get rid of those
vulnerabilities that we had last time

158
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,100
and you can be at you can go back and
pull those reports in that life cycle

159
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,350
right so let's take that let's take
those sample findings that I had and

160
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,210
let's kind of walk through them so again
we had the week default passwords we had

161
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,530
the open ftp server we had the open file
shares we had the old critical

162
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,300
vulnerability we had the network
segmentation vulnerability so if we look

163
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,099
at that we go up a level and we say
what's tactical what strategic we can

164
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,980
say the weekend default passwords
obviously is tactical again right i mean

165
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,330
its single item single box if we see
those the strategic responses policy

166
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,710
enforcement for that one

167
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,060
obviously we're not enforcing our policy
which every some good security policies

168
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,290
change your password

169
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,730
ok I mean we've got t-shirts that say
change your password right so every good

170
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,610
security policies going to have change
your password change your default and

171
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,350
also have strong passwords and so the
response to that is that we're not doing

172
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:02,060
a good job of enforcing our policy right
so let's let's step back and let's say

173
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,989
why not

174
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,350
and let's try to review the policy
review why it is that this policy is not

175
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:13,310
getting implemented open ftp this one is
configuration it could be policy because

176
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,130
you could have a policy against ftp
server specifically a lot of security

177
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,370
policies for medium-sized and small
companies don't necessarily include that

178
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:25,370
specific detail but so this is really
configuration eliminate the anonymous

179
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,680
ftp access right at least have some type
of authorization required so that you

180
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,030
can be able to access the files that you
need to if you need to use FTP and use

181
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,380
and basically attacked the and not allow
the attackers to utilize the default

182
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,170
anonymous passwords open file shares so
I include this both in policy and

183
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,550
configuration because if you don't have
a security policy regarding file shares

184
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,689
you probably should

185
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,310
and so that's gonna be a policy issue
and then configuration because if you do

186
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,430
have a policy that says you can have
file shares on your network then you

187
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,650
want to make sure that those are
configured properly you wanna make sure

188
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,850
that you have the AC of the permissions
lockdown have the ACL set up in such a

189
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,760
way that only certain access is a

190
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,840
well so old critical vulnerability

191
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,610
this is the bane of mine again like I
said I never wanted to see the show up

192
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,590
on test reports and I said so why is
this and what I found in the role that I

193
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:28,180
was in previously is that we didn't have
a good cyclical process to come back and

194
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,780
look at these critical vulnerabilities
that we spun up all this effort on to

195
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,699
remediate so we're a large company and
we would spend up special projects to

196
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,790
remediate critical vulnerabilities
because we had poodle we had you know

197
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:46,209
hardly we had shell-shocked etc and so
what I have found is that we did not

198
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:51,280
have the process to come back and look
at those again on a cyclical basis and

199
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,810
still keep them prioritized so they
would end up on the report with all the

200
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,410
rest of the vulnerabilities and that's
not it that's not something that I felt

201
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,560
was good because if we as a company
decided that we need to spin up a

202
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,819
special project then we should continue
spinning up that special project just

203
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,850
reiterating it every time that we find
this one ability somewhere else and then

204
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,510
we need to find out why it's showing up
right is showing up in our builds is

205
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,590
showing up and you know can system
configuration after the build houses one

206
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,880
ability coming back in network
segmentation so this is security

207
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,390
architecture but again this is something
that vulnerability management should be

208
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,260
involved in you're going to have if
you're a large corporation you're gonna

209
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,020
have security architecture team that
doesn't mean the vulnerability

210
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,220
management is not plugged into it you do
want to have an understanding of what's

211
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,240
going on in the in the network
architecture because that's part of

212
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,700
understanding the controls right that's
in place so again how do we identify

213
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:51,280
these instances this is pretty simple
right for the individual vulnerabilities

214
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,540
that you can scan for like we can
default passwords open ftp open file

215
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,430
shares critical vulnerabilities you can
obviously configure scan templates in

216
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,459
any of your vulnerability scanners and
then you can produce reports that are

217
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,030
necessary in order to separate these out
and come back to these and look at these

218
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:12,100
again as part of your life cycle
security review of the network

219
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,260
architecture so again I i like to stress
this one because when I worked in

220
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,610
vulnerability management it was not

221
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,700
something that was common in the
companies that i was in for the

222
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,120
vulnerability management team to get
down in and sit with operations for a

223
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,540
few minutes and network operations
especially because network operations

224
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,579
teams that I worked with they tended to
be in their own little space especially

225
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:38,180
if they manage the firewalls and that's
actually outside of security what

226
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,260
happens if some companies they really
get protective when security sits with

227
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,689
them for a minute but that's okay you
can let them be protective but just you

228
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,180
have to you have to be able to work with
them and you have to be able to sit with

229
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,719
them and say look I need to understand
the code that controls that we have in

230
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,700
place and I need to I need to make sure
that we can you know we can make sure we

231
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,130
eliminate the vulnerabilities related to
that

232
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,220
so take a look at the firewalls look at
the firewall rules there was one place

233
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,660
that i worked at we're here from the pen
test report we had found that the

234
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,019
attacker was able to pivot from one VLAN
to the other they weren't supposed to be

235
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:16,070
able to do that we get back and look I
sit with the architecture team or the

236
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,329
network architecture team and I asked
him to pull up the firewall rules he

237
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:27,800
pulls them up and it's in listening mode
said well good job there guys scope so

238
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,810
again even and honestly the like I
noticed after i did that after i SAT

239
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,859
with the network architecture team they
actually wanted me to come back they

240
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,550
wanted me to say hey you know what you
found that other thing can you like look

241
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,399
at this other stuff here take a look at
this we're about to build out this VLAN

242
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,720
does this make sense and so you can you
can build that relationship with those

243
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,870
operational teams and then you can get
this kind of response so that you can

244
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,910
eliminate the vulnerabilities before
they exist

245
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,439
alright so what do we do with all of
this

246
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,160
well we boil it all down put the balls
of the funnel and we put it into the

247
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,709
vulnerable management lifecycle again
you want to basically take these reports

248
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,290
you want to put them in have some
specialized processes around them so

249
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,918
that you can come back and respond to
them in a in a manner in which there's

250
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,449
prioritization that you need on those
divided on those items and then you

251
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:20,240
wanna make sure that you have it as part
of your life cycle to come back and

252
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,859
review these items you want to come back
and review them again because you're

253
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,659
your executive your manager

254
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,140
they're going to ask in three months and
six months ok

255
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,160
and they're gonna come back in three
months and six months and they're gonna

256
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,380
say hey we really want to know where
we're at with these issues especially if

257
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,160
you've told them we need to take this up
a level and we need to enter we need to

258
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,110
go across the enterprise or as many of
these vulnerabilities i'm in the end

259
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,240
hey why are we doing all this especially
the vulnerability management because we

260
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,290
want to keep the boss happy right as
long as this guy smiling and has a nice

261
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,590
fat cigar he's happy and so that's why
we do it

262
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,830
not only that but I mean we have a
passion around it that's why we're here

263
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,820
right

264
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,879
and that's pretty much it

265
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,880
thanks guys

266
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:29,570
yeah yeah so automations my friend so
for tracking that what i would do is at

267
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,990
least at several companies that I work
that we can actually put in automated

268
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,980
reports and some of the tools these days
have automated reports so you can

269
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,610
actually have it where it will spit out
those automated reports back to you or

270
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,399
you incorporate those things in the
dashboards right so if you have a

271
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,370
dashboard on your vulnerability
management software then you would

272
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,250
incorporate that there so you could you
could track your individual remediation

273
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,560
process is for those items right

274
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:59,450
does that make sense or ok that okay
yeah yeah yeah now I definitely would

275
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,410
love to talk

276
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:06,530
yes question of the day here comes one
moose through it he could have you okay

277
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,850
yes no we didn't put me in sewers that
would've been awesome though

278
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,899
now it wouldn't take any two weeks
hopefully but then again I was a windows

279
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:21,680
guys so I know actually so here's ok so
i got root because basically I again up

280
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,490
my windows 31 technician windows 95
texting on the phone and turn you know

281
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,530
telling people to reboot and I basically
was like okay well so how do i do this i

282
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,280
started searching and it was I think
alta vista the time which again

283
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,170
ridiculous ok but when I ended up doing
is I did what everybody else did at the

284
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,110
time and I got on AOL got to chat rooms

285
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,689
ok I know like now LOL like a bad

286
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,810
thing but back in the day it was either
that or nothing

287
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:53,120
ok at the first at first until i found
out about IRC and so I find out below

288
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,929
there's these other chat rooms that
nobody knows about right there all

289
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:02,090
secret so I get into IRC and got into
BBS's which were still around the time

290
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,980
and so I ended up getting into the chat
rooms because i was using AOL hell right

291
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,370
and all these other tools to like knock
people offline and you know just screw

292
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,409
with people and so I basically just got
into the scene and so I got into a

293
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,240
couple IRC chat swear you could ask for
exploits but they wanted shells

294
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,560
well we had a shell server so i was able
to get some shells handed out and one of

295
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,639
the guys sent me this exploit and he
said look this works on freebsd to do

296
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,570
which is what we were running and he
said it's an it was related to ssh

297
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:40,639
actually and it but it was openssh
installed on frequency because openssh

298
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,070
was still new right back then and and so
there was an issue there and basically I

299
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,419
got the I got the shellcode which was in
Russian yeah I'm sure you guys have

300
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,050
dealt with that

301
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:56,810
ok so i got the shortcuts in Russian and
so I didn't even know about DC I was

302
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,830
like what the hell is this a compiler
but I just I got some guy that basically

303
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,090
told me through the IRC this is kind of
how you do it i don't know if it's gonna

304
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,330
work for you and I said okay cool so
then I started reading man pages like

305
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,560
crazy and I said okay how do I do this
how i do make right and so basically

306
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,540
that's what i did and finally I got a
executable I executed it and root

307
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:22,760
property I was like whoa and then I was
hooked right I was that's game on and so

308
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,250
then from that point forward I always
was trying to get route somewhere

309
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:31,580
whether legally or illegally but at that
time there was no laws so I was good but

310
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,399
basically that's how i did it and it
took me about two weeks because I to get

311
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,910
into the scene and i had i think for
those relationships to get the exploit

312
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,960
yeah it's not like you can go to exploit
DB right like you can now and just go

313
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,850
pull an exploit it's not that easy

314
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,850
so yeah good question that thanks

315
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:55,450
I look okay i'm not at all i'm not at
all but I feel okay especially after

316
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:01,660
last night so I was that you're you're
setting up and starting a new program

317
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,030
today for all that

318
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,850
what's your first hire you are you gonna
go network person or you know system

319
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,600
personal video's director we can
automate everything for you where's your

320
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,490
if you're starting it up where is your
first angle like this and what I yes my

321
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:24,550
view might be biased because I'm an
operations guy but I truly believe that

322
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:30,159
having that operations experience really
helps you write especially when you're

323
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,290
talking i found that i found that on the
team that I work on I would come in and

324
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,740
those guys would not be previous
operations guys and I would come in with

325
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,850
previous operations experience and I
could build that relationship right with

326
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,639
those Ops teams and so I could get a
response that was completely different

327
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,830
than what those guys were getting right
it's so the ops guy the guy that did ops

328
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,939
her nose ops and then moved into
security or like me that was involved in

329
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,630
security but just did operations right
did operational things I think that's a

330
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,590
good first higher because you can form
those relationships and then build those

331
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,310
processes because they know what it
takes to actually fix those things right

332
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,250
so that's kind of a good first higher if
you're building out the team and I mean

333
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:19,510
in my opinion obviously yeah yeah I got
this I got this time so basically we got

334
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,330
the next guy out so but you can
definitely talk to me afterwards yeah

335
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,129
and youtube thanks

336
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,160
alright thanks guys appreciate it

337
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:42,850
I that would have been ridiculous if
that actually I never has never will

338
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:49,689
have another question because I in
suitors the whole go to the grave i am

339
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,980
not actually here is crazy
