1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:14,220
I really like this new light presenter
minions get warm is all presented

2
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,710
readers of the time through the left

3
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:38,130
ok ok when we get started of my name is
Harry Regan and I hear the microphone is

4
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,810
on i'm a vp of consulting services for
secure comm this is valerie Thomas she's

5
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,180
one of our lead engineers and security
ninja

6
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:02,969
so what we're not yes that so they what
we're going to talk about is disaster

7
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,840
recovery programs the going to look at
several different ones that

8
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,200
were really done according to the book
and the book is is really written by an

9
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,190
organization called dri the disaster
recovery Institute it's actually dri is

10
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:29,090
a disaster recovery Institute
international but we leave the last song

11
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,970
off because that's what we do

12
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,810
so we're going to talk about who we are
you know why we're involved in this

13
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:45,110
train to the magic of mixing technology
and people which is always fun to do

14
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,380
we're going to talk about things that
the disaster recovery Institute suggest

15
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:57,829
that should be in a disaster recovery
business continuity plan and then look

16
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:03,950
at three real-life examples all of which
followed the rules and had a fatal flaw

17
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,760
talk about you

18
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,739
lessons learned or scar tissue and
recommendations out of that and look at

19
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:21,650
a fourth approach where an organization
use the disaster 22 training we rethink

20
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:29,299
some of their their decisions and then
talk about conclusion them and you

21
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:34,220
directions recommendations so you who
are we

22
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,060
sakura-con this is the only and i'm
going to do we're professional services

23
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,799
firm the security space of Alexandria
Virginia

24
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,450
basically we focus on critical
infrastructure and and regulated

25
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:57,168
industries finding its healthcare
facilities things like that I have about

26
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:02,599
14 years old so we developed a broad
base of expertise and in a variety of

27
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,310
areas including continuous operations
planning and

28
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:13,880
in business continuity plans and I've
always had a fascination which what I

29
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,418
call the BTA FF D syndrome which is
buttered toast always falls face down

30
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:25,250
things always seem to go you know if for
the worst

31
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,979
so let's talk about mixing technologies
and human you know technology makes the

32
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:37,820
world work people make the world weird
and business continuity happens you know

33
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,820
at the intersection of these two worlds
then throw in the emergency or two on

34
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,700
top of that and you get some real
exciting race results so my hands maybe

35
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:56,539
detail there may be logical they may go
into great detail but people don't work

36
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,040
that way

37
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,410
so there's a lot of dynamics that that
happen that that kind of change things

38
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:11,030
so the emergency scenarios can get
complex and you have to be flexible in

39
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:17,359
some cases very very flexible so you
know if you think of policies and

40
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,910
procedures you know just how they they
work out there implemented you know

41
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:30,140
generally the theory is when you put a
policy together that people are inclined

42
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,780
to follow the rules that may or may not
be true you know just need example i

43
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,760
like to use as a stop sign

44
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,849
how many people here always come to a .
we may come to a stop sign so we got a

45
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,139
couple of hands

46
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:53,330
odds are good that one or two of those
people are correct and the rest are

47
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,930
lying or mistaken people aren't that
consistent and and that's the the world

48
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:06,409
you know what we have to look with and
that applies not only to you know the

49
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:10,969
rank-and-file your organization that
also applies to the members of your

50
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:15,229
response team they have their own issues
they have their own agendas they have

51
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:21,199
their own you know factors that all
affect their behavior so one thing you

52
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,860
won't know until the disaster actually
happens

53
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:32,599
who the heck is going to show up in the
first place so things can get the not

54
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,009
quite as you anticipate so throw in an
emergency

55
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,610
basically you may have detailed plans
but all bets are off

56
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:48,679
this is your so we kind of mixed up the
order that we do the slides in this talk

57
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:53,089
so there's gonna be a lot of this year's
live kind of thing

58
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:58,909
sorry in advance this also is not my
laptop it's smaller so i can't read it

59
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:06,319
as well be patient with me so we may
also talking about the same sort of

60
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,679
thing that I'm closer to the mine so we
shall see

61
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,419
alright so we're going to talk about the
best of intentions today and we all know

62
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,619
about best intentions and roads and
paving and whatnot as we've got three

63
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:27,259
plans that were implemented and may or
may not have worked out the way that

64
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:34,369
they were supposed to and one of the
things with that is you know they tested

65
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:39,079
these everything was tested but the only
tested pieces of these and I think as

66
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,909
technology people we really start to
fall into this area where when we talked

67
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:48,229
about we tested this that really means
we tested to see if the failover work

68
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:53,599
but we didn't test anything else that
went along with the failover so while

69
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,869
you're going through these just kind of
keep that in the back of your mind that

70
00:07:56,869 --> 00:08:00,469
a lot of the failures that we're going
to talk about or necessarily purely

71
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:04,639
technology a lot of it was the
cross-section of technology and people

72
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,239
so technology only does so much without
the people behind it

73
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:12,589
anybody who does fishing campaigns and
it was all about how that works

74
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,870
if we got time which i think we probably
will i will look at the fourth case that

75
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:24,920
Harry mentioned earlier so all the
things that you're supposed to do you

76
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,920
read all of the regulations and the
recommendations

77
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:34,100
this is the way to come up with your
disaster recovery plan that safety is

78
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,930
supposed to be the number one priority

79
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:40,459
we're supposed to put people first so
the next time you read your business

80
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,490
continuity plan hai just kind of keep in
the back of your mind that that's

81
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,810
probably not

82
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,339
people-oriented that's probably
technology-oriented back to the same

83
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,720
that the failover work this work not
about hey how do we keep people from

84
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,370
getting hurt if this part of the
building is inaccessible what are we

85
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,960
going to do if we need to get equipment
from A to B and a lot of these things

86
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,430
came into play

87
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,839
that's not really a test case so i'll
save it if we have a little time towards

88
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,150
the end we'll just say if you rely on
shipping is part of your disaster

89
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,670
recovery plan but that's not always a
good idea

90
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,500
don't let them see you sweat alright so
the whole point of disaster recovery and

91
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,360
business continuity is to keep things
going

92
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,630
even if it's just the public-facing
presence so that everybody thinks

93
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,110
everything is good and you need to
figure things out on the dark side

94
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:37,970
that's kind of the way it's played
billing rate that's still important most

95
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,840
places that's the highest priority
filling is always first because without

96
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,340
filling none of the other processes
matter so when you look at your business

97
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,910
continuity plan you might wanna see
which one of these systems is that the

98
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:56,540
top priority three roles number three
lists room

99
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:02,209
yeah so back to that people thing you
know we don't really work too well if we

100
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:09,650
don't get paid a small little detail to
remember so back to the things that we

101
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:16,760
should be doing contingencies and we
talked about these all the time we do

102
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,580
the whole training and awareness and
especially key staff right these are

103
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,250
always things that we talked about doing
that we should do that

104
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,610
good on paper but when it comes to
actually putting them in place

105
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,410
these are usually really big gray areas
or missing sections that are on the plan

106
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,329
so the other thing that I want to talk
about really quick when it comes to

107
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,450
training and implementation and I think
we've got a couple bullets kind of

108
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,610
sprinkled throughout here be sure that
your cross training because if Bob is

109
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,410
supposed to do this specific thing and
bob is not there you have a problem

110
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,719
especially if Bob is to take care of the
billing system or the payroll system and

111
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,500
nobody else knows what to do then you
have a bigger problem because now your

112
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:05,780
people that you need to drive your
technology are unhappy so three quick

113
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,290
tales today it's always easier to learn
from somebody else's failures than your

114
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:09,800
own

115
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,479
that's also more entertaining some of
these they may sound a little antiquated

116
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,170
will talk about things like tape backups
and shipping things back and forth

117
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,689
we've had folks in the audience come up
to us before and say nobody does that

118
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,480
nobody ships tapes anymore

119
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,230
there are so many people that ship tapes
there are so many places that don't have

120
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,490
backups to ship it all so kind of keep
in mind as we go through this that just

121
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,870
because it's a little bit different than
what we're used to today does not mean

122
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:44,030
that every company has this in place
already so we'll talk about the other

123
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,720
911 issue which i actually didn't know
about until we started putting this

124
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,070
presentation together that was chemical
back to the people

125
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,510
all it takes is people which is great
until you don't have any people and then

126
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:02,000
we'll talk about y2k there's some
nostalgia for you guys haven't even

127
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
started drinking yet and we're going to
get nostalgic

128
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:19,240
yeah so I all three of these are our
real case studies of clients I've had in

129
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,440
different organizations i should have
that one of these are good sakura-con

130
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,040
client so i can see move things about
them so you know when you think back to

131
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,569
911

132
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,250
you know one of the things you know if
you look at other things that we're

133
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,590
going on you know they there to other
big events going on when the 911 attack

134
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,370
happened

135
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,500
number one was the the code red malware
and you

136
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:55,390
explosion but the other one was a
hurricane Gabrielle hurricane gabrielle

137
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:02,500
was not a big deal with a category one
hurricane I kind of came across central

138
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:09,910
florida as tropical storm became a
hurricane in the gulf and then came back

139
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,930
so I can play and i had was
manufacturing client has a datacenter

140
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:24,819
and outside orlando during the tropical
storm Gabrielle their whole area got

141
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:36,190
saturated and and then then it came back
so they had a a formal commercial

142
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:43,660
disaster recovery plan with a a large
reputable government whose name its

143
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,670
three letters but i want to say what
they are but the middle one is being

144
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:57,819
helps so basically deal with you have a
contract that you specify the rules of

145
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:03,270
engagement for having you're going to
you identify you have initiated

146
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:09,810
you know I disaster and then they will
have an area reserved for you

147
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:16,709
equipment specifying and yeah what you
trigger the disaster get your your

148
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:23,040
backup data there by whatever means you
can set up operations run out of there

149
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,800
until the disasters over migrate back

150
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,699
it's wonderful except on line 11 their
backup recovery site with sterling

151
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,480
forest New York they couldn't get the
company to answer the phone much less

152
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:47,250
you know help them you know with their
disaster because everyone from New York

153
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:54,660
was was trying to need to get their
their services also so two things you

154
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,600
can find out from that is number one if
the disaster site can accommodate you

155
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,120
they give you this very polite your
request cannot be accommodated answer

156
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:15,030
but you do get your money back so the
good news is you're down hard but you

157
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:24,180
get your money back for the disaster
recovery . so you know it's it was a hit

158
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:30,120
they had a few other issues so they kept
their backup site that backup tapes yes

159
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:38,430
they were honest-to-god tapes on site
and the plan was maybe the fedex no more

160
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,540
than through the middle being out there
in Central Florida all you have to do is

161
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,540
get on 95 drive north that disaster
recovery site and and i love them

162
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:57,510
unfortunately today they had nowhere to
go they had also arranged for specific

163
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:03,300
equipment they had some weird
communications and I say weird but let's

164
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:09,810
just say legacy communications
environment they were is 400 environment

165
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:15,109
so yeah well they had the equipment

166
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:22,040
it's a plans and then you the the intent
was they could just swap over he had

167
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,910
never really fully tested you know they
had tested you know parts of it but you

168
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,930
know it was it was kind of iffy whether
they could make they could pull it off

169
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:38,300
so with really an untested plan that was
kind of iffy you from the beginning

170
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:44,120
where they could actually pull it off er
uh but the good news is again with

171
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,079
third-party disaster recovery site you
can get your money back if you can't be

172
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,890
a i accommodated yes they flooded data
center with it was flooded they were

173
00:16:54,890 --> 00:17:09,589
down hard but they learn stuff actually
awesome i love this one

174
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,669
ok so we're going to learn some more
stuff probably not exactly the same way

175
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:24,049
so New England the Rolling Hills it's
very pretty and nice in scenic how if

176
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,449
you've been in New England you know that
it's dotted with nice little cute

177
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,530
historic towns and there are cool things
there like Mills that they make into

178
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,450
various things like restaurants and
hotels or in this case a company that

179
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,429
manufactures specialty equipment for the
medical industry not sure why exactly

180
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:45,320
they chose that location but the most of
them are a good price when they bought

181
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,178
it but they didn't really think about
while this location is very picturesque

182
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:55,400
and it was probably very cheap it's very
close to a lake so they were planning

183
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,370
for their disaster recovery they decided
you know we'll just do shelter in place

184
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,350
and for those of you who don't live in
that kind of area shelter places where

185
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:12,469
your work something bad happens and you
stay at work they don't let you leave me

186
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:19,549
at the lake she mention is a man-made
like with a hundred-year-old damn

187
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:26,150
details didn't say anything to the
insurance company about that either

188
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,220
but that's a problem for later we're not
talking manager it's so it's a

189
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,530
shelter-in-place it works

190
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:39,410
not even a little bit because if there's
a disaster and folks with families are

191
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,429
told that they need to just stay there
and do their job and definitely bad

192
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:48,440
things happen the other problem with
shelter in place is what happens if the

193
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:55,340
disaster hits when nobody's at work
groups probably didn't think about that

194
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:13,970
too much and we all know about the 8020
thing right

195
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:28,129
yeah yeah probably not something that
they the paper saw yeah probably not so

196
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:33,230
when I got the big storm how they
decided to get out when they so the

197
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,800
generators up it's tied to the natural
gas lie as long as there's gas we have

198
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,580
power

199
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,510
it's probably good probably don't need
to do anything else there they had

200
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,809
divergent carriers with failover so
that's pretty impressive actually

201
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:50,330
considering their location that they
were using two different ISPs it didn't

202
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,330
help them but it looks really good

203
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,429
they set up a lot of remote access and
things to really kind of run on their

204
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:02,750
own but they really still plan on
everybody being there to feed and water

205
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:08,420
all of the systems so they always had a
robust and tested remote access policy

206
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:14,990
so back to testing again we test remote
access policies do we test them with

207
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,460
fifty percent of our workforce trying to
connect do we test them with like five

208
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,100
guys from Mighty that night

209
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,340
usually we test them with five guys from
Mighty and then when three-quarters of

210
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,270
the company needs to connect nobody can
connect i don't understand what happened

211
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:36,860
we tested it also similar issue here but
they must really really key thing here

212
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,959
on this whole thing

213
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,799
they decided that we will only train
certain people to do certain things

214
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,340
so if Bob is to take care of the system
the middle is to take care of this

215
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:52,129
system that's all we're going to teach
them which is great except for when

216
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,330
those people don't show up so when that
was brought up it was well we'll do that

217
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,199
later we'll take care of that later and
we all know and later happens later

218
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:08,360
happens never so i made 2006 that area
experienced severe flooding like a lot

219
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,020
of new england all the
telecommunications were out though so

220
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,360
their divergent redundant connections
that looks so cool didn't help them so

221
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,320
when you don't have any connectivity you
don't have any remote access kind of a

222
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,270
problem if nobody is at work when this
happens and the roads are not usable

223
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,020
shelter-in-place doesn't really work
when there's nobody in the place to

224
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:36,620
shelter so this building basically sad
in the middle of this unattended for a

225
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,899
few days so it's kinda like the movie
home alone sort of right over the kids

226
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:45,649
home alone and you just kind of like
lives it up i'm the assistant State up

227
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:50,570
so a lot of the things that they put in
place on the technology side state /

228
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:56,000
useful but nobody was really there to
kind of keep an eye on stuff so even if

229
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,720
something did happen they wouldn't have
a way to know i love this one so they

230
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,000
also discovered that when they tested
the plan that they forgot to test how

231
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,320
the voice networks that boy phones and
the physical access control system the

232
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,370
thing that you know locks and unlocks
the doors they forgot to test those to

233
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,989
see how those would fail over or if they
would fail over and they kind of forgot

234
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,640
to move those two backup power and
because nobody was in place on the

235
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,740
shelter to do that there are no phones
no internet access and when physical

236
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:37,190
access control systems lose power all
the doors unlock so all it is a simple

237
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,929
there but systems were up alone with all
the doors are locked

238
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,440
so if you had a boat you could probably
get to the facility pretty easily

239
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:49,190
they didn't lose anything which is
really kind

240
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,940
interesting because if you had a boat
and a little bit of motivation you could

241
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:59,240
have carried everything out so it was a
good plan it was tested but not all the

242
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,350
way tested and that's really where cross
training starts to to come into play

243
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,570
that there's only one piece that we rely
on one person to do that's probably not

244
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,889
the best way to do it was their plan
successful

245
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:21,800
well I mean everything still stayed
upright so sort of they were out not

246
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,520
necessarily there couple of days a
couple of days longer than a couple of

247
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,320
days but when you make that your
requirements loose than you know you're

248
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,639
kind of always and always overachieve at
that point all the automated processes

249
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,170
ran so the whole you know don't let them
see you sweat thing you know as long as

250
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,220
the client wasn't physically looking at
their building everything looked great

251
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,220
on the internet facing side so for the
client's perspective

252
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,960
nothing's everything is great unless you
try to call little details but nobody

253
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,620
goes in control for three days until
they finally got the road serviceable

254
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,340
enough to get somebody back into the
building back into the building through

255
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,540
the unlocked door

256
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:18,980
so then good old 1999 this particular
company uh I was ok i was you that was

257
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:25,940
Grayson community that so I was director
of security for this company

258
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:38,389
yeah y2k as you can remember probably
was was a non-event I was the second

259
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:45,380
shift duty manager for you know for the
Washington DC area so that meant I was

260
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:52,540
on the site at midnight on gone the
summer 31st 1999

261
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:59,139
the we had two scans that we detected
one was coming from Tel Aviv and we

262
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,030
don't know who that was

263
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:06,760
the other was coming from Carnegie
Mellon University which so we figured it

264
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:12,310
was some grad student who had the you
know less family and social life than we

265
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:19,330
did we determine that we could have it
you know our duty cycle was from 15

266
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:24,189
december to $MONTH $YEAR 15 januari we
discovered you really can have pizza for

267
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:35,740
dinner for 30 for 30 days and we also
discovered that the hacker community you

268
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:42,850
know had better things to do and then
try to attack us at that point but in

269
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:48,610
preparation for that we went through an
exercise you know with you across the

270
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:55,149
whole company to to prioritize you know
what applications were critical we have

271
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:04,300
no multi-tier system we you know we
tested them and went through a lot of

272
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:10,960
detail virtually all of 1999 I was
rocking back and forth between the the

273
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,970
backup data center primary data center
just testing different elements in the

274
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:22,690
program so we were ready we had
everything put together the primary data

275
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:27,520
center is in suburban New York it's
about an hour north of New York City and

276
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,490
and connective backup data center is in
the Maryland suburbs of Washington DC

277
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,640
can use google to figure out who that is

278
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,930
though neither of those sites exist
anymore long story and yet but they had

279
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:49,420
taken you know care to to try to address
all possible problems so they had

280
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:56,470
standing hotel reservations at hotels
that that both data center sites they

281
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,920
had

282
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:04,580
gone through just nauseating detail in
testing you know different different

283
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,540
scenarios that was up you know a
scenario-based plan you know this

284
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,680
happens we're going to do this this
happens we're gonna do this this and

285
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:20,150
this happen that we have you know about
third set so we had a you know last but

286
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:28,040
not least we had positions then fine you
know kind of a role based model to say

287
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,840
different things happen then this group
would work remotely and they would be

288
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,750
issued laptops and then be sent off of
this hoteling space and very detailed

289
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:48,770
plan but did we had monthly testing new
york city staff was basically spread

290
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:56,210
between three locations one liberty
plaza Times Square and wall street again

291
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:01,700
if you play with google for a while you
can figure out who this is and if staff

292
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:08,360
had to be displaced you know they're you
know they were both hoteling working as

293
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:15,260
a locations and and some people could be
sent home yet with with laptops to do

294
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,340
their job

295
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:24,139
y2k cane and it was a non-event nothing
happened but that was the plan that was

296
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:30,380
in place when 911 happens so that was
the plan that that they executed against

297
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:41,870
one liberty plaza is across the street
from the world trade center so if you

298
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,530
think about the stock market for a
second you know that while the market

299
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:52,340
opens at nine-thirty the market staff
actually is on silent 6am so all the

300
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,030
market people are already there are
already there they're preparing for

301
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:02,210
market open and that's a both
datacenters you know the first plane hit

302
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:08,210
before market oh no what about 8 15 uh
you know a 20

303
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:15,809
about that time so the decision was made
and this was made you really have a

304
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:20,309
governmental level you not to open the
stock market so they were actually ready

305
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:27,059
to go when the first plane hit but they
they want on what's called a hold

306
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:32,908
waiting for things to happen you know as
it became apparent what was what was

307
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:38,429
going on you know the liberty plaza and
Wall Street staff were evacuated to

308
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:44,700
times square at least that's what they
thought they were going to do a network

309
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,549
was transferred to the backup site with
a incident but you know on one level

310
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:56,700
that the plan was very successful you
had one almost seen one that almost

311
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:03,210
seamless transition of of the systems
from the the primary cover backup

312
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:08,399
internet cesarean because the market
didn't open that in fact the market was

313
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:15,748
open and closed for two weeks after that
the market system staff was on on-site

314
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:23,129
in place ready for your normal lab
operations and the corporate staff know

315
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:27,539
where were all you know this is eight
o'clock in the morning a lot of them

316
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:33,450
haven't even made it to work in the
backup data center was in the DC area

317
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:44,399
and that was as you recall another 911
target site there were staff injuries

318
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,789
and you know but no no fatalities

319
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:54,239
so why were there injuries if you have
that that facility you know that that

320
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:57,359
condition seven place and it's because
of human nature

321
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:04,259
what do you do when the building across
the street from you gets hit by a plane

322
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:13,090
you go out and look so they had people
from the one liberty plaza office go out

323
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:18,610
and we're watching you know the as
things unfold the second plane hit in

324
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,360
the south tower collapsed when the south
tower collapse

325
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,669
that's when several people were at
binary no fatalities fortunately but

326
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:37,570
that was different it was a disaster so
the the problem with the bad the

327
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:44,980
business continuity plan is there is no
plan for losing Manhattan you know

328
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:51,220
everything with was compartmentalize to
two different locations things like you

329
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:57,580
have the evacuation plan it assumed that
the streets were navigable in the public

330
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:03,310
transportation was it was available yet
people out of the area that did that was

331
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,780
unavailable

332
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:10,899
uh because of damage to the one liberty
plaza building you know there were

333
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:17,740
severe and lasting workforce issues you
know just a displacement of people from

334
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:26,860
those locations and the other thing that
ok this was the y2k plan this was put

335
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:33,250
together in late $MONTH 1999 was
finalized its now 2001 that's two years

336
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:42,850
later I t never ordered licenses for the
vm for the for the staff but that's okay

337
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:48,280
because they also didn't order laptop so
I tu wasn't ready to get to bring in

338
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:55,149
this this influx of remote workers and
sometimes you get lucky

339
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:01,480
so yes if you read anything about the
world trade center in the basement of

340
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:08,500
the South Tower with the ATM t switch
center for metropolitan New York when

341
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,520
the building collapsed switch center
became unavailable

342
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,629
let's say the UH

343
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:23,350
and they also took out the soul towers
on the on the top of the building but

344
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:29,260
this company used MC on and although the
things were rounded out of Connecticut

345
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,450
so you know that they weren't affected
by that so they had the network they

346
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:41,770
could still operate but you know me that
was was destroyed

347
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:50,320
this is your alright so instead of
lessons learned and recommendations I

348
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,799
think scar tissues a little bit more
fitting especially with some of these

349
00:33:53,799 --> 00:34:00,100
organizations recurring drills are
important and it's not just frequency

350
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,830
its scale as we've seen a couple
examples here backups

351
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:10,389
oh my gosh huh so if you're doing
incremental backups and your system goes

352
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:13,240
out on the twenty-third of the month

353
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:17,560
it's gonna take a long time for you to
get that system back up to where it was

354
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,418
on the twenty-second so you might want
to test that a little bit to see exactly

355
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:24,429
how long that's gonna take

356
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,520
if that's not an acceptable time they
need to rethink the way that you're

357
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,879
doing backups and AJ pairs and all that
great stuff because if you're not doing

358
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:37,600
backups properly or at all then you've
got bigger problems

359
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:43,270
so we've also seen this happen with a
handful of clients where they needed to

360
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:49,659
do a bare metal restore but they didn't
necessarily know what they needed or

361
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:54,609
have a really good list of everything
that the software required so that

362
00:34:54,609 --> 00:35:01,330
you're going to need more than one thing
and actually we had a little while back

363
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:06,369
you really just don't plan for losing
two drives that are buried five array

364
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,660
like it

365
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,830
how does that happen right so even if
you lose two drives out of your raid 5

366
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,740
it's going to rebuild but it's not gonna
be pretty

367
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:20,830
so for quick how long it will take a
long time to rest fucker it

368
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,740
transactional systems they really get
upset if the handoffs not done properly

369
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,709
so i'm not going to talk about any
vendors here horrible those systems get

370
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,760
really upset if you get that mixed up
and then you get really weird things in

371
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,430
the database and we all know what
happens when we get corruption in the

372
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,390
database

373
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:46,310
lots of people have very bad days if
you're using a third-party backup site

374
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:53,660
and it's not something that you looked
into really testing like live testing at

375
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,410
do that and check your service contract
with them because a lot of times they

376
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,970
may not have the actual equipment that
you need and that doesn't sound like

377
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:08,149
things like cables and raid controllers
and if you have something with god

378
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:12,680
forbid scuzzy drives and you didn't tell
them that then you've got a bigger

379
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,750
problem

380
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,680
yes we have clients that use scuzzy
drives but that's another story

381
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,640
so what do we do all this and I think
that we really need to look at the

382
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,348
disasters that you're potentially fixing
not just your organization but what

383
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:35,450
about your disaster recovery sites so
for those of you who don't know I

384
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:40,549
actually started my career in the
defense industry so i used to be but a

385
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,599
better now

386
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,460
a lot better now I guess work for the
defense information systems agency so

387
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:51,890
that's kind of like the ispf DoD right
back all long-haul comms and satellites

388
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:57,618
and good stuff like that they didn't
really think about stuff like disaster

389
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:02,599
recovery sites and disasters when they
did a lot of their planning so they're

390
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:08,510
one of their sites for backup was
slidell louisiana let's put the backup

391
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,950
side below sea level

392
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:16,250
what could possibly go wrong so when
Katrina hit and we were trying to get

393
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:22,550
things coordinated between ash the
state's jtf Gina oh do you know of it

394
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,270
doesn't headquarters and what the folks
needed at Slidell you know we needed to

395
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,670
get equipment to them

396
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,510
mostly not special equipment

397
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:37,119
good luck finding a carrier that's gonna
deliver that for you so you call fedex

398
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,859
and they're like oh yeah you know UPS is
still open you might want to check with

399
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:46,630
them were we're not we're not gonna
deliver their so if you depend on that

400
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,380
you might want to have another had
another process in place just in case

401
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,460
something like that happens that lots of
other really interesting lessons out of

402
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,950
Hurricane Katrina but we'll leave it at
that for now we won't go into what you

403
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,950
can't spell without pizza

404
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:10,750
they're not a client it's cool but you
could especially not now

405
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:21,790
oh well he didn't we already talk about
their personal yes and back to

406
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,029
maintaining equipment at the dr site so
if you have it in your contract and you

407
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:29,710
know they have the equipment and you
upgrade at your primary site

408
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:34,660
how many of you actually remember to
make sure that the dr site upgraded if

409
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:39,339
you didn't do any kind of real live
rollover testing then you're not going

410
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:43,569
to know and then what happens is the old
hardware can't run the new software

411
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:48,250
which you don't know until nothing can
run the new software and then you have a

412
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,869
bigger problem so they were to drop this
into the ground

413
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,470
cross-training is good we need to make
sure that we have backups for the

414
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:01,629
backups for the people not just the
technology and because you use don't

415
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:08,140
know who's gonna show up or not show up
until the disaster comes that looks like

416
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:15,129
your slide you know so i mentioned
earlier you having granular plants and

417
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:22,390
and what that really means is is really
two things you know one is going to the

418
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:29,828
level of detail that you know you you
think you would you need to address for

419
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:35,530
a known disaster you know have
categories of disasters

420
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,570
yo definable

421
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:44,380
answer them and a tail approach on on
how you would do it but things never

422
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,030
really happened like you expect them to
so expect the half disaster

423
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:57,100
no its you didn't lose the data center
your lost part of the data center or you

424
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:04,060
know it's you know the network you know
you have a regional Network out a lot of

425
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:11,529
total network outage so there's no there
there's things that that can make your

426
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:19,570
life you know tricky if you if you don't
go into the detail and in any disaster

427
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:24,700
you know when your people are variable
so you know you can have these great

428
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:31,000
plans that lets say you know these five
people are going to have certain these

429
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
roles in disaster recovery

430
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:42,370
you know I've been a lot of plans have a
primary secondary and tertiary but let's

431
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:47,710
take a case of like a pandemic you know
something like that none of them may be

432
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:55,180
available so you know it's it's you've
got to be able to plan for that and and

433
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:17,440
the you know how you you address it so
to the extent possible compartmentalizes

434
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,270
the message that's have the situational
plan but have it you know done to a

435
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:31,030
level where you can you can take pieces
of the plan that's always good to have

436
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:36,760
what I call an MC is the strategy which
is the oak crap it's something new

437
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:43,750
you know it's you can sit down and think
about all these different possibilities

438
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:49,630
but the nature is interesting it can
throw things at you know by the way

439
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:56,620
usually I don't use the word crowd or
crap in the OC is but you can you can

440
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,890
fill in the east

441
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:05,589
let's talk about an alternative there
was a another client this is a different

442
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:13,990
911 story was a cosmetic company
headquartered in New York they have a to

443
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:21,129
R&D facilities ones in in central New
Jersey ones in Nice France

444
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:27,310
yes the French Riviera so they had
planned to consolidate all the

445
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,740
researchers in New Jersey facility and
the company I was working for at the

446
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:39,640
time was with helping them build out and
define the new are the center by the way

447
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,870
cosmetic companies are one of the
biggest consumers of security technology

448
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:50,319
on the planet because most of what they
have are considered trade secrets so

449
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:59,680
yeah this particular are the facility
had no access control system your

450
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,330
physical access control system the video
surveillance they have biometrics in

451
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:10,630
different areas the sophisticated
operation and very typical of that

452
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:20,260
industry so uh when 911 happened you
know they made a a corporate decision

453
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:28,450
that they would take the you know the
corporate office and you forget about us

454
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:34,899
this consolidation of the researchers
move all the corporate people down to

455
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:41,830
the you to the facility in the New
Jersey and you know that's that was a

456
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,960
good example of being able to capitalize
on

457
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:55,040
on a disaster to into basically lessen
your risk profile but it's always

458
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,490
bothered me was always worried me that
the researchers in the French Riviera

459
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:08,540
who were told they were moving to New
Jersey they are the ones who perpetrated

460
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:17,210
my woman you've heard it here first so
if you take nothing else from this test

461
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:23,720
to refine repeat be very flexible but
things will not happen like you expect

462
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:30,859
them to happen and when it does happen
you know be ready to work you know from

463
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:39,650
the pieces that you didn't plan for and
I love quotes from George Patton because

464
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:44,390
he said some some terrific things and
the one that applies here is when the

465
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,740
first shot is fired

466
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:51,319
battle plans go out the window so it
won't happen like you think it'll happen

467
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,950
thank you

468
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:42,290
you know so questions comments
obscenities gingerly so they the ideas

469
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:51,470
to be flexible you know it's and the
willing to deviate from love from the

470
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:57,109
plan or or go through a much more
intense planning program and have you

471
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:08,060
have contingencies laid out most dr
plans and bcp plans that I've seen in 30

472
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,120
years of working with these real
