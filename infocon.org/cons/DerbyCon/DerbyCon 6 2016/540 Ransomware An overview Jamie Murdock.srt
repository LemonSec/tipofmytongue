1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
your guys alright alright so thank you
for coming

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,099
this is gonna be a talk on ransomware
it's just an overview so it's not going

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,990
to be like getting into the weeds of
each kind of ransomware it's going to be

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:23,550
basically what we see at our company as
the most popular kinds of ransomware

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,439
right now some detection methods and
things like that so without further ado

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,488
fine i'm jamie i'm the chief information

7
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,690
hi I'm the chief information security
officer at binary defense systems my

8
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,280
career it's always been blue team I've
never been one of those weird hacker I'm

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,090
gonna break stuff

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,750
I'm the guy who's like now you're not
going to get in here but let's face it

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:56,219
they did come a big gamer so like those
like hey one thing about you the gamer

12
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,899
and i'm an old school nerd my first
platform was a Commodore 64 love I wish

13
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,810
I still had the end if you feel like
followme that's my handle on Twitter and

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,020
even though none of them are here which
is awesome for support

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,770
special thanks to the binary defense
systems threat intelligence team he's

16
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,830
not a threat intelligence team income no
actually i can solve them very

17
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,420
frequently they're really really smart
guys who really know their stuff so

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,750
thanks guys you're not here but I'll
watch it

19
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:38,100
so what we're going to talk about again
we're going to go over trends and

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,500
ransomware what we're seeing at binary
depends and this is not a plug but then

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,720
this is what we see we monitor a lot of
different networks and we focus on you

22
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,939
know what can we do to help other people
the most common types that we're seeing

23
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,419
and some of the build platforms i'm not
gonna spend a lot of time on that

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,100
because it changes so often that
honestly I wrote this presentation on a

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,229
wednesday and it's probably changed
since then we're also going to talk a

26
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,239
little bit about what we see on the
horizon what do we have in the field

27
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,750
that really track the step where

28
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,800
see coming out what we think is going to
be the next thing some detection methods

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,540
and also some best practices so what
we're seeing for trends so ransomware

30
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:33,940
has increased 3,000% since it first got
recorded really quick anyone what do you

31
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,840
think that is what do you think
ransomware has jumped that hot it works

32
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:49,390
it's easy to get paid health care and
point-of-sale systems at and banking in

33
00:02:49,390 --> 00:03:00,910
general are the major oh that could have
been so bad meet my phone because I know

34
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,829
people call me just because I'm up here
and mess with me so you know healthcare

35
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:12,970
and point-of-sale systems major targets
right now help health records are you

36
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,560
can actually get more money for health
records and you can for your credit

37
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,320
cards now out there's a lot of you know
health information online so you know

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,769
the criminals know this and they know
that if that kind of stuff gets locked

39
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:36,700
up there in a world of hurt and that
goes to the next point which most

40
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,890
companies do not report ransomware if
they get hit by ransomware been reported

41
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:47,230
to the authorities and that makes it
very hard to actually get a good trend

42
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,060
on what's going on

43
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,890
I've worked with the FBI on a couple of
different things and that's their

44
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,779
biggest complaint if you will right now
when it comes to cyber crime is we can

45
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,310
get a good trend of what's going on
because companies aren't telling us that

46
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,920
we're getting that they're getting hit
by ransomware they're not telling us

47
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,048
anything about it now when a company
gets breached depending on the

48
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:15,549
regulatory compliance they have they
have to disclose and they work with the

49
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:23,020
FBI etc etc so the FBI has a lot of good
information on how breaches happen you

50
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,020
know what do they do except excited but
not when not with ransomware

51
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,239
companies actually part of their
incident response or part of their

52
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,550
policy for cybersecurity is hey we need
to buy bitcoin in case we get hit by

53
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,040
ransomware that's actually part of their
instant response process we need to buy

54
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,020
bitcoin just in case we get hit

55
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,830
not you know what's do the right thing
let's have a good security program

56
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,030
eccentric cetera

57
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,630
it's up look at all these companies are
getting hit with it was just buy bitcoin

58
00:04:52,630 --> 00:05:00,460
and ransomware as a service tell you
what if you were a bad guy

59
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:07,030
it is a great service to begin it is so
easy you can literally just you know if

60
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,229
you go to the right places say I you
know I wanna I wanna go after this

61
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,300
company but I'm not technically savvy
enough to do my own ransomware or I

62
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,919
don't really understand how it works

63
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,380
no problem I'll take care of it and they
get their cut of whatever you do and

64
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,400
it's a great business model actually the
tech support for those guys is better

65
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,140
than tech support like Microsoft and
other places because you know they want

66
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,349
to make their money to an action it said
they actually care about their customers

67
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,110
come on

68
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,080
so what are we seeing is the most type
common types of ransomware right now so

69
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,430
I only picked for the top or that we
actually are seeing right now if you

70
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,080
read different things online etc etc
will be different from this this is just

71
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,340
what we're seeing so depto or walkie is
also called is the top one we're seeing

72
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,789
right now and that actually is pretty
common across the industry right now is

73
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:14,110
a depth over walkie is the big thing a
server version 1 2 & 3 is is still out

74
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,570
there and it's still doing a lot of
damage . Lochie is a little bit newer of

75
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,630
one will go into that a little bit and
then coaster

76
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,280
so let's talk a little bit about the
pepto AKA lucky

77
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:40,810
what's that I'm sorry yeah o.o do not
write a little bit

78
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,550
no I can't but we'll do that and I'll
stand over here

79
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:53,200
alright sorry about that guys thanks for
pointing it out though so depto at

80
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:00,909
target target's all versions of windows
and the thing about that is even if it's

81
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,340
removed a lot of times if those you
still get your files so ransomware you

82
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,479
know you'll say hey I got hit it will
tell you to contact this pay this

83
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,280
Bitcoin you get the Decrypter it's all
good now with this one this one's

84
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,849
actually kind of you know a jerk
ransomware where you will and i'm

85
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,130
actually trying to not because it's hard

86
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:27,460
yeah so you still might even not get
your files easiest way to tell for this

87
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:37,840
one obviously has a . septal extension
the server this one is actually a pretty

88
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,710
smart way to go about you know if you
want to do ransomware because you have a

89
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:49,180
week to actually pay to get the
description heat now a week isn't really

90
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,400
a lot of time when you're doing an
investigation when you're trying to

91
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,049
actually figure out what's going on

92
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,160
can you get files can you not get files
well if you don't pay within a week

93
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,400
it doubles and it continues to go from
there

94
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,140
I it creates a few different files their
name decrypt my files and that's dropped

95
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:14,590
every folder that the encrypted files
are in so the funny thing about ransom

96
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:21,489
or two is it's not once you get hit like
it's not that hard to tell if you have a

97
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,930
targeted attack against the organization
you know you might get some kind of

98
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,500
alert some kind of trigger that you know
okay somebody's here and then you have

99
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,580
to go go through the needle in the
haystack trying to find out what are

100
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,150
they doing how they get your ex cetera
not ransomware ransomware is pretty much

101
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:44,169
hey Here I am you gotta pay me and it's
very so this was very similar to a crypt

102
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,210
a wall and Tesla grip that lucky

103
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,810
it's a very enough of Tesla crip
three-point out i'd say it's fairly

104
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,900
newer and it does change the victims
files to a different string every time

105
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,540
so it's not like the you know like
decrypt my files to thing it actually

106
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,849
changes the string it's a little bit
more hard to find and the tricky thing

107
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:19,780
about this one it will delete your
shadow copies and it will also kill your

108
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,839
system restore points so they're
actually get a little bit better a and

109
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,830
by day i mean you guys to develop the
brains were about trying to protect

110
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,480
themselves a little bit more so it can
take care of all the the problem for

111
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:42,430
them if you will of well you know we'll
just restore coaster this responding

112
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,219
this is actually kind of one of my
favorites just because it's kind of like

113
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,760
a big troll 2 it will actually do what's
the the common like police scam so it'll

114
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,189
go through your history your browser and
it will find a website and say hey

115
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:03,100
you've gone here and this is an illegal
website or this has a legal content or

116
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:09,880
you just shouldn't have been here and it
will say that because of what you've

117
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,650
done you have a legal activity

118
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:17,680
your stuffs been encrypted and you need
to contact us and pay the Bitcoin well a

119
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,920
lot of people will see that say oh I've
gone to this site I should have gone

120
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,729
there

121
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,200
the feds know now I have to get my stuff
unencrypted I don't tell anybody because

122
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,210
you know i went to a bad place

123
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:36,940
so this one actually has a very very
high success rate for the payment and

124
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:44,380
obviously for obvious reasons a very low
point of being being reported the place

125
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,870
yes sir

126
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,380
have problems of on your pain does he
know

127
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,850
yes yeah yeah so the question was the
iron yeah yeah so the question was is

128
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:59,640
this morn the premise of like it's a
fine not really it's not really a paying

129
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,480
a ransom it's more on the you you have a
fucking foregoing here and yes it is

130
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,480
that is that is a good question thank
you

131
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,380
so some of the different platforms with
this ransom was built up of I'm GAMEOVER

132
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:22,890
Zeus is still a very common platform
actually the entire zoos family a lot of

133
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,569
ransomware is built off of that because
it's easily did it's easy to deploy from

134
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,910
nuclear exploit kit again another one is
very easy to deploy it's very easy to

135
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:39,089
drop so it's you know the the ransomware
authors they know what's what works and

136
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:44,190
what doesn't and now from our in general
so they'll actually develop their kids

137
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,060
to be put into these things that already
work and of course you know Lockean

138
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,099
cryptolocker so on the horizon

139
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,450
so again this is not necessarily what
they say this is what we're seeing and

140
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:06,270
what how we think everything is gonna go
down so ransomware buyers or going to be

141
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:12,000
start are going to start customizing the
things a lot more and we're already

142
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,120
seeing this with Adam so being able to
customize your your malware orbits are

143
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,060
you ransomware for what you specifically
wanted to do

144
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,119
we're already seeing where you get the
entire disk encrypted not just specific

145
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,020
files and we're seeing this without with
mamba now obviously that's a lot worse

146
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,459
because maybe encrypting files and maybe
the files that it gets you don't really

147
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:42,089
care about but when you have your whole
disk encrypted for obvious reasons

148
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:43,260
that's a big problem

149
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:50,160
no command control interaction needed
this one is something that lucky

150
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,410
starting to do again and embeds the key
so there's no interaction needed so even

151
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,020
if you you know you just find out

152
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,640
oh i just downloaded this

153
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,540
and i believe it's France where you pull
the plug so it doesn't connect it

154
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:10,230
doesn't talk out doesn't matter because
it doesn't need to talk back targeted

155
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,610
ransomware i'm going to talk a little
bit more about that in the next slide

156
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:20,010
but now when I say targeted it's not
just a specific company that they look

157
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,100
for so let's say they're going after
binary defense

158
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:29,160
ok so the right them at the the
ransomware for that but if they do the

159
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,780
Recon properly and you're gonna and
we're going to see this a lot with

160
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,410
state-sponsored attacks they're going to
start using ransomware in their attacks

161
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:44,040
so they go through their whole the whole
process of you know doing their

162
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,160
investigations on the ad on the company
finding out what kind assets they have

163
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,930
eccentric cetera and you're going to see
that when they when they do their

164
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,910
attacks it's going to include ransomware
specifically to specific assets in that

165
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:03,839
organization more module ransomware
that's actually already happening in

166
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,790
France were being put out that's very
easy to decrypt so ransomware comes out

167
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,530
and investigator finds it they decrypt
it really fast like a cool look at us we

168
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,490
found this new variant and we were able
to throw description or we were able to

169
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,340
decrypt it on her own and we're awesome

170
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,230
well yeah thanks you just testing my
piece of ransomware and I know that

171
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,830
these are the tools you use i know this
is how you decrypted it so when I

172
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,250
actually build the correct platform of
it I know how to avoid that

173
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:41,430
thanks for playing so detection and this
is in general this isn't for a specific

174
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,650
kind of ransomware or and or it may not
work all the time but you know look for

175
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,310
some indicators of copper are the
indicators are compromised for various

176
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:57,900
things so a lot of times you can find a
hash IP you can find the domain for the

177
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,410
command control so you can actually look
for that monitor for that and if you see

178
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,069
any connections to these things or you
know you you see this hash on your

179
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,030
network you know you have ranch work you
know

180
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,730
watch for any kind of modifications to
the

181
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,709
I our registry because obviously for not
only ransom urban any kind of malware

182
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,029
you know it's gonna do something it's
going to replace some things so look for

183
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:30,550
using honey pots and honey files is
great and again focus ransomware so if

184
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,359
you happen to find talking about the
ransomware testing if you will from the

185
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,920
last slide if you happen to find
ransomware and you know you go through

186
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,519
the process you have somebody come and
and they say okay cool don't worry about

187
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,839
it we took care of it

188
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,279
we were able to decrypt it this
ransomware sucked watch for that because

189
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,149
more than likely if that happened now
it's just a thought that was just a test

190
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:58,029
for your environment and prepare for the
actual targeted attack of the rats were

191
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:02,290
specifically to your organization and
that's already happened that last bullet

192
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:08,469
point I can't really talk about the
details of it but there was a company

193
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,120
that's had a piece of ransomware
enhancing and seen before they called in

194
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,110
their instant response they said hey
don't worry about it we took care of it

195
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:26,230
and then a few months later food
targeted so some best practices this one

196
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:33,279
its security awareness training was done
properly it doesn't matter whether it's

197
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,639
ransomware it's malware its social
engineering

198
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:41,560
it's blah blah blah this is the best
thing you can do for any organization

199
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,829
because people are the weakest link

200
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,620
so like every talk i ever give and it
has anything about best practices that's

201
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:56,709
always number one specifically more from
malware for ransomware you know don't

202
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:01,839
enable macros and documents for you know
email attachments that's just just don't

203
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,929
do it anyway but specifically for
ransomware you know obviously patch you

204
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:10,929
know stay current with the new threats

205
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:17,470
the more you know the better you can
protect your organization so always you

206
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,510
know kind of keep an eye every day

207
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,540
what's going on what's new with France
where with root do with malware what are

208
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,550
they doing how's it being executed
housing

209
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:33,350
dropped I'm show your file extensions if
your window shop you know don't hide

210
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,250
them show them that way if you have a
few files that may have been encrypted

211
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,870
but their files you don't really pay
attention to you know doesn't hurt

212
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:48,320
always go go through check to see what's
there to see what's not there and back

213
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,689
up your data because if you get hit and
you don't have a copy and you don't want

214
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,690
to pay then you don't get the data I
mean it's just that easy

215
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:05,540
the last one ok that was so questions

216
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,330
Karen yeah go ahead get one

217
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,639
sure

218
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,830
so the question was what's the best way
to in essence the state card on you know

219
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,669
how race where is affecting the
environment and you know basically what

220
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,450
they're doing

221
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,560
the first thing I would recommend is
follow me Douglas who is right behind

222
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:39,350
you on twitter i'm just kidding she came
with shameless make Douglas plug i'm

223
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:45,889
not-- so there's a lot of I mean
honestly twitter i hate Twitter but I

224
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,980
love Twitter so what's that

225
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,950
yeah yes

226
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,950
so let me just said sans internet storm
center is really good

227
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:03,889
there's a few threat until services out
there that you can get a lot to get

228
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,390
information from as well so sans
internet storm center is a good one

229
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:16,220
alienvault otx you can actually get file
hashes ip's a lot of things like that

230
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,370
now there's there's a lot of good open
source stuff out there and honestly if

231
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,810
you just like Google what's going on
with ransomware or things like that

232
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:35,060
you'll find a ton of great resources is
your question mr. I was not

233
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:44,520
bi rate on your resume our network
number you I've never done by offering

234
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,820
like my environment and I I'm not
interested more self-reliant about

235
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,300
warnings the whole thing but not
everyone's like walking out of single

236
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,639
for the whole unit

237
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,980
what if you have a best practice won't
meant that ok so the first one the FBI

238
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,860
raid on GAMEOVER Zeus yeah so that was
for ransom or authors and and

239
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:15,990
distributors more so that was a big hit
you know to their pockets so that for

240
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,050
now that get hurt them but just like
anything else right

241
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,110
they're gonna find up you know those
guys and you know once everyone gets

242
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,179
locked up they're gone and somebody else
is gonna come in and take their place so

243
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:36,330
temporarily yeah it was it was a hit and
you know you you saw well if you will if

244
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,330
you watch trends but just like anything
else

245
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,929
somebody's gonna come in and take the
spot on the second honey pots

246
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,030
I understand what you're saying about
locking the stable once the horses are

247
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,930
ya

248
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:55,110
the horse is stolen however using your
honey pot and let's say your honey pot

249
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:01,320
gets hit right a if you're monitoring
you know that on a simmer

250
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,040
where do you have whatever you have
you're going to see that and you're

251
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,860
going to be able to detect that before
something else gets hit and that's

252
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,780
that's the most important piece so you
know obviously you want to make your

253
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,379
honey pot attractive but not too
attractive so an attacker is going to

254
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,870
you know what it is but if you're
monitoring that then your honey pockets

255
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,610
hit and then BAM you know

256
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,500
Oh something's going on I need to take
you know whatever minds response steps

257
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,790
are just like honey files so many files
you know it's a file

258
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,230
hey look at me this is you know this is
juicy if something touches it then you

259
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,330
know instantly like okay i need to you
know I need to investigate this like

260
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,500
pronto answer your question

261
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,700
there was one Guardian with just one
second

262
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:56,120
using brings you later

263
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:04,159
yes so the question is a weenie hybrid
attacks so for some make might come and

264
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,600
steal data and then also you know drop
and squares of the question

265
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,740
yeah okay so yes and that's going to
start happening more and more honestly

266
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,650
when you start seeing more
state-sponsored attacks in France where

267
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:22,310
so you know if I'm an attacker I'm gonna
go in and I'm gonna get the data you

268
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,669
know that's what I want that's my end
goal whether i'm gonna use it to so

269
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,270
whether i'm gonna sell it I'm gonna dump
it or whatever else that's my end goal

270
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,350
and obviously if i'm going to take it
somebody at some point is going to know

271
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:40,310
that I took it and they're gonna report
it or do whatever however if i drop

272
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,580
ransomware when i'm done then I get two
things out of it right

273
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,699
I get paid again and it's less likely to
be reported because we have ransomware

274
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,320
and a lot of companies don't want to say
they got hit with Iran's work it's kind

275
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,570
of like you know if you have a you know
if you have a kidnapping or something

276
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:05,210
like that a lot of times in important
countries they don't like your ransom is

277
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,870
paid and you never hear about it because
it just entices that business of

278
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,070
kidnapping if you will

279
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,629
same thing with ransomware answer your
question sir

280
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:28,400
so hold your heart i'm not familiar with
it so my thoughts on its effectiveness

281
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,660
are none just because i'm not familiar
with it

282
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,439
yeah I'm i wish i could like throw more
out there for it just to make your

283
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,190
question to answer your question will be
better but unfortunately it does hurt

284
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,730
your reputation is not a right

285
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:56,530
I get the fact more than the line they
have the ball question though is a loser

286
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,270
it was the danger or maybe ilysm of
measurement this other anywhere after

287
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:07,480
having back and falling up everything or
something so later Superman right

288
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Superman persistence so I'm not
necessarily saying don't pay it because

289
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,610
honestly if you don't pay it you won't
have your quote you won't have your

290
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,389
files

291
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,890
I mean so unfortunately if you're not
following best security practices and

292
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,740
you don't do all these other things and
you get hit with it

293
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:32,110
your only choice honestly is to get as
far as like dropping a rootkit are

294
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,830
dropping other things afterwards for
some persistence haven't really seen a

295
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:42,100
lot of that get another good about you
you're all that great business model

296
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,590
right whatever numbers up

297
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,389
well you're right from a from the
business side of it though right so when

298
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:53,380
you start doing like targeted attack
state-sponsored stuff you know they're

299
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,570
they're doing it you know to as part of
other attack methods so yeah I mean it

300
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,470
makes perfect sense they wanted you know
have some kind of persistence afterwards

301
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:13,240
mr. follow on that though recognizing
that might have you anything you have a

302
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:23,950
Mac you really have part of I'm me
personally I'd rather put that money

303
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,050
toward you know doing the doing the
right thing the first time you know it's

304
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:36,879
it's it's hard right so if you're an
instant response person you're going to

305
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,350
say no don't do that put the money where
it should go from a business standpoint

306
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,389
though sometimes you can't get those
funds in that area right so it's a

307
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:51,490
catch-22 my personal recommendation of
my professional recommendation is don't

308
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,270
spend the money on buying bitcoins spend
the money on securing your environment

309
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,720
we should be

310
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,050
any other questions once twice

311
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,190
alright thank you all for coming I
appreciate it enjoy the rest of your car
