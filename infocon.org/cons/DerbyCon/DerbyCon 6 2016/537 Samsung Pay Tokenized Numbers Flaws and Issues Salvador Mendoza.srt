1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
LOL mr. Mendoza and it's my first time
here and everything so I'm very excited

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,450
to hear i'm going to talk about sounds
of a took a nice numbers for some issues

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,790
I want to start with the agenda for
today we're going to talk about

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,220
terminology analyzing talking numbers
MST NFC protocols and how somebody

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,160
implemented fucking faces for some
issues dangerous scenarios can spay

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,610
talking get to some tools i made for
this research international tokens max

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:38,370
goodbye and your device i'm going to
introduce to you the stack and other

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,780
researchers so some terminology for this
tag is NFC poop on your communication

9
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,940
MST for my next security mission so
basically what something implement is

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,260
like a when you're going to make a
payment he uses super balls to have a

11
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,440
wider vendor sturminster acceptance
different from Apple pay which use NFC

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,710
pts for Wichita Police Service recognize
numbers which said process were the

13
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,408
primerica number is replaced with
struggle value which means a target when

14
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,360
I'm talking about talking let's think
about a nice language I talking outers

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,159
Bonjour to church interchange for goods
and services and PSP for talking service

16
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,180
provider and bad for America number so
let's analyze they talked to a nice

17
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,040
number basically the same the same
arbitrary card the personality it's on

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,869
the lots of men

19
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,649
I mean the first Cindy it's the lots are
20 the years they are the new organized

20
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,079
number which is like an ID for that
talking and you can you just one talking

21
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,809
for each transaction so we have the
surprise what they did was exactly like

22
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,520
making a format for american bank on
station emulating the perfectly this

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,550
physical type in car

24
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:09,050
let me show you basically what he talkin
from sons of bears so let me use my

25
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:22,370
phone so i'm going to make a
transformation so this one is going to

26
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,810
send the same talking talking about like
one minute until the terminal gets the

27
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:35,480
target he had seen again talking and
making our target you can always this

28
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,799
one is kinda parent with into fire right
here 32 33 is going incremental i'm

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,830
going to i'm going to add sometimes just
to see the difference between each one

30
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,830
went to make like maybe five

31
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,500
slow down so what I'm going to do it was
bc by then

32
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:21,700
yes to make a arm very view of the
taärgons so basically what you have

33
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,530
here is that the last Tony Tony arm
digits of the talking

34
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,390
what is the difference this one right
here it's the inspiration inspiration of

35
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,309
the car it recorded the next one is a
service code we change for example you

36
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,660
have a chippy protection in your car and
you are into this some pay this one is

37
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,640
going to change it for 11 yet without
put without any restriction is what i

38
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,950
call the bc our role which is the first
counter then it's one is the ID

39
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,320
transaction on the last three digits and
around the numbers basically this is the

40
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:04,570
format of the talking which is supposed
to be very random but the reality is not

41
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:16,298
so that is exactly what I tell you about
a bitch feel the difference between

42
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:21,370
online and offline mode is B is the main
difference basically is the counter in

43
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:28,630
the middle here we see this seesaw
counter right here if I put an airplane

44
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,950
mode I can use my sense of pay to make
payment but this counter is not going to

45
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:38,289
change so what is going to change its
going to be is going to be yet state ID

46
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,290
for each purchase and around the numbers
and the end

47
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:54,550
so what I said you can make payments and
offline mode like any other transaction

48
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,920
the bank's you go two phases physically
is when you make it you you integrate

49
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,440
the talking is go for some kind of
status until is represented like active

50
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,930
pending this balls and roll expire after
about the time . suspended basically

51
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:18,640
how you how the system updated talking i
was stuck into some guys in Samson and

52
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,090
they said this was not true

53
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,429
basically what what they say this kind
of simulation wasn't true but what I

54
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,320
found the gold was here you see the
probation professional talking or

55
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,950
something like that when the girl is
they using the tables that data to make

56
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:45,430
that date basically he solved data that
you need the preparation took an ID but

57
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:54,070
also happy number so it's all the
information what on our thing they say

58
00:05:54,070 --> 00:06:01,180
they never save data and the storage but
also found that talking to retrieve from

59
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,340
a story for MST so I don't know what
you're talking about how maybe they're

60
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:13,359
you know that framework I found many
many files and directories inside the

61
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,620
samsung device is not just because you
get you can now root the phone and use

62
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,990
the sub-basement honestly so it's
impossible but what if I was holding

63
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:32,110
scanner in our files they use it to make
this content sections and many many

64
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:40,630
databases he would take a look of this
that is right here in the bottom is that

65
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,320
is were attacking arena he canceled

66
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:54,080
information I'm right now I'm the visa
with a framework inside of the samsung

67
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:03,440
pay let me take a look at the basic
samsung bear use this framework and the

68
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,469
bottom the top

69
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:14,770
to to complement the North Star package
they are separated two to make the

70
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:24,820
tokenization process so another plan
issue i found was in the the databases

71
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,580
maybe they're thinking this database are
encrypted but i wanna fun was like an

72
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:37,120
institution characters inside 22 in this
case to encrypt the data bases and they

73
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,000
kept the static passwords and the
functions but it's not yet for for the

74
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,770
databases by itself by also far more
functions i was thinking maybe it

75
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,780
possible for the network encryption but
I can I cannot say sure we could make

76
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:59,020
their own States policy another plan
issue they found was when i was able to

77
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,990
make it back about databases I found the
duct inspiration feel and database

78
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,950
wasn't blank that means something was
wrong here

79
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,140
also they were tried spy time implement
timestamp format but it was for one day

80
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:20,919
so what I noticed was if you have for
temple they ask you a show me how it

81
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,930
sounds of rewards are you have shown me
how supports a sense of place generating

82
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,729
1000 but you're not using that talking
to make a purchase that you're carrying

83
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,689
the talking gets to show me house of
rewards then it's time that you are

84
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,979
going to make a payment year ago

85
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,940
you're going to generate a new talking
but they're not stalking is still life

86
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:49,420
still active so anyone else can use it
to make a purchase green exactly active

87
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,420
but don't use them

88
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:02,200
yeah so innovation for the i found was
when I had a delayed my guard in san

89
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,139
Tropez are the new vertical is almost
the same but

90
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:16,009
I try to do different days I tried to
make a log and everything so what I

91
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:20,569
found was that the last four digits what
will really change in the period of time

92
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:27,858
so but how you can get lots for David's
judge you need to and you're going to

93
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:32,239
get from the side of the card without
any password something you have physical

94
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:36,410
access to perform so if someone can get
the talking

95
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:44,600
maybe he can guess the nets for two
years so let's go to the good things I

96
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,529
was attacked

97
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:52,309
Wow one of the things i was thinking
about is to reverse then keep our and

98
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:59,209
the group functions this one is able to
do that if he one person can found 80

99
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:04,189
day and not for example is going to be
able to revert the databases on

100
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:08,719
information from be suffered simple for
mastercard american express or any other

101
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,829
bank also design a talk and get my
talking get baby it's a divider you can

102
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:23,569
put your arm get were are under your
thoughts and you can use it to detect

103
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:34,399
organs so basically what i did i have my
this device under my god i'm going to

104
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:42,410
want to use it to generate Targon I can
see it

105
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,300
this is ally of my credit card reader so
what it does is it sent this talking to

106
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,250
my email so i can use another device
like my experience from car to make it

107
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:06,860
purchase basically you can see in the
background how the pleura capture that I

108
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,630
load this Dawkins one of the organs to
make spoof device

109
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:20,060
I'm going to a machine I'm trying to
make it a perches so basically select

110
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:27,260
the product anybody dated talkin what
some say that it was impossible because

111
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:40,430
you need many things from the phone to
make this purchase so they devised was

112
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:45,290
John spade and space and your device is
the same thing about this device you can

113
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:50,000
put in the terminal closer to a terminal
so basically what it does the same thing

114
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,740
you can just live your live in the
terminal and the person camps to

115
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:03,649
terminal try to make a purchase on its
sense this are talking to the email but

116
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:08,839
I improve this tool and you're going to
see and then it's videos yet it's going

117
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,220
to have a fighting work server so you
can control the service inside the

118
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:19,970
computer by basic why you that you do is
like the person is going to make a

119
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,589
purchase by its German that is Johnny
determinate sending signals to a

120
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:30,709
terminally cmst another much school
device inside of the other same bots so

121
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:34,219
it since then it sends signals to the
terminal when the persons want to make a

122
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,320
payment the terminals is no more and no
is not more input mode so it is not

123
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,990
going to attack the new the new talkin
so basically going to talk and sent over

124
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,410
email so i can get it and you say

125
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:58,550
timecard advise my spoon and make it
bridges so then some

126
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:07,639
so let's try to get sick dogging what
I'm going to do is I'm going to put my

127
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:27,649
my . in airplane mode and I mean to
start capture dragons that's one and you

128
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:36,410
will notice the counter in the middle
and want to change anymore so it's a

129
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:42,110
game you see in the here in the middle
discounted is going to be in the same

130
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,310
position ever

131
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:48,229
so this is going to incremental and the
last ones here is going to be around the

132
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,740
numbers so we're really you need to
guess is the last three digits

133
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:56,660
basically they say it was impossible

134
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:02,540
this was not going to happen or call
again things but there is a problem here

135
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:13,459
international attention patrons I was
thinking that it was possible to use

136
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:18,018
these tokens in our country maybe I was
thinking that they have some

137
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:23,420
restrictions from this physical credit
card the victoria card so i say one of

138
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:32,059
my tokens to one of my friends in Mexico
Sanpei is not Mexico yet so I thought

139
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:38,180
that maybe this one is is one going to
happen but it says a man can you check

140
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,130
out this out and try one of my talk and
symmetrical he's charging it to any

141
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:49,069
mexican places so it's making a
transaction

142
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:58,050
translation went through gets sign it

143
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,589
there you go you have to

144
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,770
mexican best for me and so basically i
got the notification I got a

145
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:14,189
notification from Samson hey you know
here in the water you get it spin to any

146
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:20,760
mexican places where somebody is not
Mexico yet they say what they say about

147
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:30,270
this was the committee crystal close its
kind of you know just played some so i

148
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:39,960
want to introduce today Eragon the max
by this max group is any device from

149
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,980
raspberries

150
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:47,370
so basically the same thing like Max
proof but you have the opportunity in

151
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,680
this case like you can use the raspberry
to have variable tracks on it for

152
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,540
example what I did

153
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,099
why I did this kind of pry it was
because I i was need to update the talk

154
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,490
and every time I need to use it so I
design this prior and a Python to start

155
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,990
changing the tracks when I wanted when
the way I wanted also you can change the

156
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:16,110
bar right all kind of things on so I
make I'm a video this one was the first

157
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:25,200
prototype kind of amusing every x 3 and
sleep REM power boost USB cable mass

158
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,020
group and everything is some internet
you can find all the prior internet so i

159
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,740
made a video here and there be calm

160
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,850
of course so basically what it does is
like

161
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:50,410
disinvite him just to test it to see
what is it doctor talking i have a timer

162
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:57,339
so he takes a while to start
transmitting i basically does is like is

163
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:03,670
like the it's acolytes I'm account card
device the same thing after that I'm

164
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:14,589
going to use my samsung device to update
the code so it's I compiling all the

165
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:21,188
things and updating the code to the
Brian even without removing the main

166
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:26,949
point removing from the raspberry so
it's updating it takes awhile because

167
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,750
you know it's like a microchip

168
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:36,640
laughter is ready what I what I noticed
was when i try to use this device and in

169
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,660
the video i was trying to use about
works and it didn't work

170
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:49,240
you can see right here the coils on our
side so I turn our flip it is it what's

171
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,429
going on but after a while he going to
him to get it so that's a new private

172
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:06,280
them in two years for this research in
the future so another researchers have

173
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,290
found that I'm not the only person who
is researching about on some pain after

174
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:17,230
up term Italian that condom packet i
found a they were some guys and Asia

175
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,330
they were researching about this this
issue what they found was I was thinking

176
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:28,240
about it but I never had the opportunity
to it you can you can has named the

177
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,650
signals or even almost two meters using
a coil

178
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:48,470
using a big coil like these ones so it's
it's kind of maybe you're going to use

179
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,430
that we're going to take it's about you
know three with you

180
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,730
yeah so basically I mean it's possible
it's it's gonna it's there it's a

181
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:07,280
possibility so takeaways for this

182
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,840
this dog is about the sense of play has
some level security participate that

183
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,070
could be tired from malicious attacks
somebody also have some limitation in

184
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,270
the organization process which could
affect customer security and finally

185
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:26,930
talking to generate by some baked with
the use in our adler please you have any

186
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:43,220
questions that i think i think the areas
are here asking about if the encryption

187
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,870
for for the databases basic place for
his different bridge for each phone or

188
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:53,870
gets one specific upon what it was that
this code the static password for

189
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,310
databases to encrypt the database is the
same for each phone i mean is the same

190
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:10,940
for each fun because it's diet static
password home he depends if you're

191
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,530
talking about the encryption databases
it just the same the same function they

192
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:25,220
use the same function if I grew after
I've already have seen that the database

193
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,760
howto after you root your phone and
you're gonna try to use some pain

194
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,789
somebody's going to detect it's going to
take

195
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:36,789
it's a roof on he's going to relate
everything

196
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:49,929
yeah probably yes already has these like
extracting have probably yes

197
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,520
probably yes

198
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:18,400
hi I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you has been
but yes prolly is is that no you can yes

199
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,150
you can I i saw people buying like 2,000
using something and people buying one

200
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:30,970
dollar some space so it i'm not tell you
can buy a car by you can buy expensive

201
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,559
things with it

202
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:38,799
yes offering the oven over the vending
machine

203
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:48,190
I does that purchase will go through
they like you know basically it's an FCS

204
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:55,570
MST what I'm talking so our weather
divisors is the device is going to in

205
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,639
this particular case my device is going
to our sin MST single-season max proof

206
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,620
so when when the people is approaching
to make a purchase this terminal is VC

207
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:12,309
doing my in this case validating my
talking is only using my microscope so

208
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:16,960
when this person came into the Machine
and try to make a purchase the terminal

209
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,659
so bc that isn't going to the tag that
talking about the schemer and my device

210
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:30,590
is going to detect it and it's going to
send it to my email like that with me

211
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:38,750
yes what I'm hi i saw some sometimes and
back at like hear about how to attack

212
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:45,350
and FC so it's possible I mean units a
lot of devices to this on you know about

213
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,389
the possibility is there

214
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,390
yes but there

215
00:22:52,970 --> 00:23:06,140
yes indeed sign in

216
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:14,299
I mean it's very sign in it's not like
because somebody has a very restricted

217
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:20,960
system this case is not yet the system
is also not on the top so mainly this

218
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,750
application is under layers is not yet

219
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:29,059
normal application yeah exactly so
that's a maybe protection of these gonna

220
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:31,668
this kind of devices

221
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:35,539
that's why I think they used their use
in obscurity for security in this case

222
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,700
basically we're doing

223
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:51,500
yes sir I never dry it to be honest I
never try but what I found was what i

224
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,179
wanted found was when you open the sump
a device you through it

225
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:02,270
everything's going to related but I
never try to pull the database because

226
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:07,580
my research was just to try to find the
ways you soon eight

227
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,649
normal normal device and try to find
kilometers and never tried to ruin or

228
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:15,260
something like that

229
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:22,760
hi I'm hi reverse the application
basically yes although all the file type

230
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:31,580
to show you it's in that isn't that in
the goal that we can get

231
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:41,330
all the structure from the code and they
are many many many researchers adult so

232
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,330
I didn't say thank you to these guys
they really helped us a lot

233
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,460
thank you thank you
