1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,430
alright go ahead and get started uh I'm
gonna see if I can actually get it back

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,660
on on track so I'll just I'll just talk
fast if you have any questions

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,950
throughout please interrupt me I might
be making certain assumptions about

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,630
knowledge that are false because this is
kind of a niche topic in some ways and

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,029
it's hard to draw the line at like who
knows what right so I'm talking about a

6
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,970
dns set so what is dns sec I think we
all know what Dad dns is it's the

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,920
infrastructure that allows us to look up
a name and figure out what IP address it

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,500
points to the problem it is what if the
person giving you the IP address is a

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,640
liar

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,660
what if you're in starbucks and someone
has man in the middle of your connection

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,190
and you've got a malicious name server
that's actually returning that you know

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,989
bank of america . com points it you know
this IP and actually it's bad guy and

13
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,739
obviously that happens you know we hear
all the time like you don't like to like

14
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,319
you know why you can't trust and such
and so the problem of actually securing

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,320
dns is a real one and an important one

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,150
we obviously have other solutions and
other protocols things like you

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,720
obviously like TLS and in fact DNS SEC
is going to be I sort of the same kind

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,580
of answer to that also DNS SEC was
created in 2005 yet the original

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,140
specification and the whole idea that
it's meant to prevent spoofing of dns

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,990
responses so that you always know that
when you get back a in a record or

21
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,949
whatever record that it has been signed
and authenticated it's actually coming

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,210
from the authoritative name server that
owns that domain and much like TLS idea

23
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,169
Messick relies on a public key
infrastructure it's really not that

24
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,119
different from the idea of x509 and you
know sort of this idea of having a

25
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,979
certificate or roots and intermediate
certs and actual site certs the

26
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,030
difference of course is that DNS is
inherently hierarchical so it's actually

27
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,169
the biggest problem with TLS is how do
we figure out what a route sir is it's

28
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,750
that actual original key distribution
and so dns

29
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,780
sort of solves that from the get-go
because it's hierarchical I'm iina

30
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,550
whatever you wanna call it is the owner
of everything . which is the root zone

31
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,920
of all domain names ultimately every
single fully-qualified domain traces its

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,420
lineage back to . and so ima can consign
everything underneath it right and those

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,690
are like your TL these which are calm .
edu . you know or so on and so forth and

34
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,350
then that follows down naturally right
where you have microsoft home

35
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,519
that's a new zone and then everything
below that like you ftp . microsoft.com

36
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,030
is its own zone and so you can always
say that in DNS SEC a record is always

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,820
going to be signed by the parent in that
zone or for that so-and-so for you have

38
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:12,100
a website like my bank . Dom that record
when you actually query for for their a

39
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,500
record will have a signature that signed
by . DOM and then when you query . Dom

40
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,500
you get a signature from . and so that
be all you need one key and from that

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,880
the whole internet works right I'm
interestingly just this week

42
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,880
IMA rotated out there signing key after
the first time in 11 years which is

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,459
interesting as information security
professionals the idea of having a

44
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:45,400
extremely important key that you only
rotate every 11 years is weird but I

45
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,030
guess it's like really convoluted like
you actually I'd like to guys like whole

46
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,410
like caring smart prize around and like
had like physically like put the new key

47
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,489
and it's like this whole process so
maybe that's what we do every 11 years

48
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,070
first thought that was interesting
because that means that if the keys

49
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,350
compromised it's gonna be a long time
before that gets fixed so yeah it's been

50
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,260
11 years so we should expect that

51
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,298
dmsx is widely adopted obviously the
problem of securing our DNS

52
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,140
infrastructure and proving that records
that we get are correct is really

53
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,140
important so that so since we have a
solution

54
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,289
everyone's using it right i mean we
should be at that point in the adoption

55
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,289
curve where it's been widespread

56
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm what's wrong and we're going to talk
about why officially dmsx is widely

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,730
adopted so this is 2006 you can see that
it's experimental in some places now

58
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:45,160
they're starting to put it into like the
roots you know so you have . a tie-in

59
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,730
and then like different countries will
have like their own like country to DS

60
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:55,540
or for example like Aaron which is the
registry for the North America my own

61
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,270
like you know certain other TL DS and so
us gonna has a trickle down and so this

62
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,880
is 2006 and this is today so DNS SEC is
everywhere so I guess problem solved I'm

63
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,890
not sure why I'm why I'm here

64
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,640
um actually nobody uses the net

65
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,950
the reason I even got interested in this
at all I so one of the things that we do

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,430
it my company's we provide risk ratings
on companies that you can see like what

67
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,610
their security posture is from the
outside in and were like oh well you

68
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,510
know what's a good metric let's see if
they protect their domains with the nsx

69
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,960
you know we have all the big companies
and like that's a good differentiator

70
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,250
whoops no it turns out that like two
percent of companies implement the NSA

71
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,650
if you look at like the alexa you like
fortune 500 like the alexa top 1000

72
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,090
nobody uses it

73
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,929
it's like you know one to two percent
and so the question is why

74
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,820
like if the idea of the problem the
domestic salt is important and it solves

75
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,419
it

76
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:57,580
what's slowing down adoption there's a
lot of things but the main thing we're

77
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,719
going to focus on today is is called
insects and so this is a set this is a

78
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:10,660
type of dns record so an SEC records for
dmsx protected name . at the next node

79
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,310
in the zone and the previous note in the
zone one of the requirements of the dns

80
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:21,669
xpresso fication as if I query you for a
name you have to part you have to tell

81
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:26,080
me that it does not exist and so the way
we proved that a name doesn't exist is

82
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,729
we tell you the closest name behind it
and the closest named after it

83
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,110
and so you know that there is no there
are no other names in between and so

84
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,710
that solves that problem and so DNS SEC
RN sec records form you know

85
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:47,760
the link circularly linked list that
allow you to walk zone and you know if

86
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,539
any of you guys are pen testers here you
probably can understand the value of

87
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,920
that I am sure that when you're doing
recon awesome of you probably try to do

88
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,540
zone transfers right which have been
disallowed for an extremely long time

89
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,890
what I'm showing here is actually this
is paypal there one of like the feel

90
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,570
like really big guys that actually do
enable the nsx and so it's trivial to

91
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,420
just walk their entire zone i get other
domainkeys i can get every single server

92
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,940
that they have on their that their name
server manages and some of those are

93
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,490
things that they want us to hit like WWF
paypal.com other things not so much and

94
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:37,020
like it's not exposing I would dispute
that I'm so that you can because you

95
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,700
could say the same thing about zone
transfers right but the reality is is

96
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,560
that just because I have a house on the
street doesn't mean i want to be listed

97
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,610
in the phone book

98
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:54,660
you know I don't necessarily want you to
be able to look me up on servers are you

99
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:04,320
the world bigger way that I get internal
temperature dragon is completely

100
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,460
separate from assets see you think
security all well I think just a big

101
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,930
positive allows total down enumeration
and that's something people don't want

102
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,580
like I mean we can I mean I I address
this later like yes some people say well

103
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,890
you're using dns wrong if you don't want
your stuff to be innumerable that don't

104
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,940
put it on Public DNS infrastructure
right there's other ways to do that on

105
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,250
you can have like split dns where you
respond differently to you know to

106
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,210
queries in different locations and so on
and so forth but obviously that's a lot

107
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:45,510
harder to manage and the reality is that
this is how people do use dns and so we

108
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,040
can just wave it away and say it's not a
problem it is so much a problem that

109
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,819
everybody disabled zone transfers in
North Dakota

110
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,550
that actually ruled that trying to do
his own transfer on his own without

111
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,160
permission permission is against the law

112
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,170
so it stands to reason that we do feel
that zone enumeration is a problem and

113
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,719
we should address it especially if it's
not actually necessary to solving the

114
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:17,100
problem of securing the infrastructure
itself and the reality is is that having

115
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,300
that so I mean so one of the things that
we do the reason I'm you know that our

116
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,260
companies we try to enumerate I'm you
know a company's entire digital

117
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,460
footprint because you want to understand
what their actual attack services and

118
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,980
being able to do inside walking makes
that trivial like like compared to any

119
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,760
other technique you could use I mean you
literally can come into this is our what

120
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,660
I should before was literally just the
output of an nmap script that allows you

121
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,189
to to pull the entire zone and now you
know every single host you know and

122
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,190
their addresses and you can start
looking at you know running further

123
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,070
stuff like a map to actually figure out
where the open services and so on and so

124
00:09:53,070 --> 00:10:03,300
forth so in some sense of security by
obscurity right but we need everything

125
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,819
we can get so if if there's not a
compelling reason to like you prevent

126
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,090
son enumeration we probably should

127
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,340
and this is something that we'd already
like protected ourselves against right

128
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,510
when we when we disable things like zone
transfers that was an implicit statement

129
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,270
that we don't want to be enumerated and
so the fact is it's going to stall dns

130
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:32,310
second option and has that's that's like
by far the largest reason I mean if you

131
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,000
you could do any research on the NSF
this is why people don't want to do it

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,830
and so there are proposals to mitigate
that ironically the idea of having the

133
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,520
entire zone be innumerable was
considered to be a benefit in the

134
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,990
specification which to me religious
speaks to the fact that the people who

135
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,190
come up with these specs are actually
disconnected from the way the systems

136
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,840
are used and so that's that's actually
the most important takeaway that I'd

137
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:06,240
like to leave you guys with is we as
security professionals and people who

138
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,320
actually use the system

139
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,680
and understand how they're using how
they are exploited need to be involved

140
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,040
in these conversations because whoever
came up with the specifications like

141
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,000
this is great

142
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,790
this way everyone can see exactly what's
in the zone and never be worried that

143
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,360
they're getting a false record but
didn't think through the actual

144
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,820
implications based on how the real world
works but that's the problem so now what

145
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,530
do we do

146
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,790
there's a couple interesting potential
solutions one of them is this idea of

147
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,439
white lies

148
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,110
we're in so the idea is that when I
query name server i have to know if that

149
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,030
name actually exists or not and so with
insect white lies what they do instead

150
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,470
of telling you the first the last own or
the the next in the previous zone is

151
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,450
they make something up

152
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,370
you know they like doing offset so you
still know that that name doesn't exist

153
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,260
but it didn't actually leaked
information

154
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:06,120
the problem with that is that again it's
it's it doesn't match the way we use DNS

155
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,690
because dns servers are typically really
stupid you know there's have his own

156
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,170
file and they're just pulling from that
and and that's all you get

157
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,060
if you need the dns server actually make
stuff up and sign things on the fly

158
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,000
now you're having to store signing keys
on your dns servers which is bad in a

159
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,020
sense that now you've opened yourself
you you widen your attack surface and

160
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,020
it's also just adding like processing
overhead that didn't exist before

161
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,490
so while the idea of white lies does
solve the problem of zone enumeration

162
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:40,200
it's not really compatible with the way
that DNS is traditionally deployed

163
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,830
unfortunately we don't have any real
alternatives tap to DNS SEC currently in

164
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,230
terms of actual technologies on one of
the biggest is his dns curve which is

165
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,180
just the idea of encrypting actual
transactions with DNA with that with

166
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,920
servers with nameservers but then that
leaves us into the original problem that

167
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,189
TLS has which is well how you distribute
keys you know how you know who to trust

168
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:11,340
and you lose the entire idea of the
hierarchical key signings that you get

169
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,400
from dns so dns curves not really a way
to go

170
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,130
um you know we talked to is that some
people say the s sec walking is not

171
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,140
a weakness you're just using the a
strong and while that's fair

172
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,790
it doesn't solve the problem right yeah
if you don't want something to be

173
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:35,849
publicly addressable then don't put it
in a public place but we do and we have

174
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,630
you know that's how everything works so
high we fix it is really the question

175
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:48,030
and how do we make things secure given
that in strength so there's there are

176
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,829
some other solutions young people so
insect Soviet the problem 10sec right is

177
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,140
that it just returns to you with the
next names

178
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,689
I'm insect three it returns a hash the
problem is it that they tell you what

179
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,320
algorithms used to hash it and they give
you the salt and the salt can be 0

180
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,250
characters so it's actually really
simple to come up with a rainbow table

181
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,620
for insect rehashes particularly because
you know you get you can enumerate all

182
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,990
the hashes right and you can already
guess what some of the names are going

183
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,630
to be you know everyone has www right so
then like since since you can do a

184
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,980
pretty target dictionary attack you can
end up actually figuring out ways to

185
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,140
break to break insect three and they're
stupid and you know demos and talks of

186
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,240
that I'm and sec 5 which was proposed in
2015

187
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,090
I uses basically i forget what the
hashing scheme is exactly but its base

188
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:49,770
prove it provides provable protection
against enumeration the issue of course

189
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,290
is that is not very holding out it was
basically an academic paper in 2014

190
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,689
which means nobody's implemented yet
clouds clear takes a really interesting

191
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:07,530
approach like I mean they control a lot
of dns at this point right you know

192
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,400
people like them and like Akamai like
all the all the CDM you know they're

193
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,630
there they're actually managing a lot of
like you know the internet traffic and

194
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,820
so I'm

195
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:24,900
they they take this approach they call
black lies where instead of you know

196
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:29,430
giving you the next record they just
sort of make something up in a

197
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,969
deterministic ways that they don't
actually have to do a database lookup

198
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,440
and they can just like if you look up
for a name that doesn't exist they just

199
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,800
they give you an SEC record for a fake
record that is department arrived from

200
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,380
the record you suggested and so instead
of having to do the expensive work of of

201
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,939
actually having to generate on-the-fly
for actually having to store signing

202
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,240
keys on the on the name server itself

203
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,930
they're taking this other approach which
also results in much smaller responses

204
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:08,099
and and that seems to work for them and
is also fits into the specification of

205
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,380
the nsx I'm so they actually have a
draft out for for preventing zone

206
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,689
walking via black eyes they write some
pretty interesting articles on on how

207
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,690
they handle a dns that skill

208
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:29,070
yes that was insect and then like
another issue that is you know not

209
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,200
really related is just the issue of
amplification which in some sense and

210
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:41,250
insect does have to do with this but
when you add signing and you add you

211
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:47,460
know large keys your your dns responses
end up being way larger than they used

212
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,290
to be and so that actually makes 10 s
take a really common vector for detox

213
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,040
amplification attacks you know be a
reflection like immediately reflected

214
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,260
DDoS attacks because we're before i
could query name server and the response

215
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:07,290
that comes back is you know maybe 300
bites now it's well over a thousand you

216
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,599
know I'm because of all that overhead of
the signing and so that just makes a dns

217
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,458
actually a really interesting vector for
replication attacks and that's another

218
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,920
reason why people don't want to adopt it

219
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,920
so yeah I guess what I'm really getting
at here is it up ultimately securing dns

220
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,670
is a non-trivial problem it's not
entirely clear how we're going to solve

221
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,020
it the

222
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,340
most important thing to consider i think
is that we have security professionals

223
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,860
need to be involved in those
conversations so that we can actually

224
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,320
guys some of these specifications to
fulfill the real operational needs of

225
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:50,340
what dns needs to do versus just what it
what some people think it should do

226
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,340
right any questions

227
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:07,140
yes this is well founded United States
and asset and combinations kitchen

228
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:14,520
regions model that that's a warning us

229
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:21,899
yeah the root key is controlled by hyena
which is not a government entity it's a

230
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,920
it's a private-public collaboration
right i mean in all of like the NCC's

231
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:32,880
like Aaron ripe apnic they all fall
under iso I don't know that that's but

232
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,560
at the same time right it

233
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,240
yeah you could say that about like
Google and Yahoo and we saw that workout

234
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:48,270
so it's not a totally unfair concerned
but I don't think it's a particularly

235
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:54,270
legitimate would think that who's
innocent

236
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,800
no no because that like I said the root
keys is is I am as its not

237
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:06,450
country-specific i'm a country could
spoof any of the DNS SEC responses under

238
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,820
its you know country TLD but I mean you
know for countries that are doing that

239
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,540
anyway they already have said crazy
control over you know the packets on

240
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,290
their on their networks that it it's the
thing that really matters

241
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,280
any other questions yes

242
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:35,350
so I think you can't blindly deploy it
you have to actually have the right

243
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,899
systems in place to sort of dns a works
with what you want to do so that things

244
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,980
like the numeration for example don't
affect you or you're doing things like

245
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,970
what platforms talking about like you
know with their black lies approach or

246
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,130
by implementing and 65 to prevent out
you know that sort of thing but the vast

247
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,990
reality the myth the almost everybody
right now deploy either just plain and

248
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,789
second sex3 and so that leaves them
potentially we guess so

249
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:11,679
federal government is Mandy it
commitment is a good choice

250
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,620
yeah which is super handy because it
makes it really easy to like a numerate

251
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:25,449
like the agency in a sec you know sighs
back in what you have right up or

252
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:32,860
recommendations on best practices for
dns set google it going on

253
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:38,709
yes so I i would gladly . you at some of
the stuff that the clapper has written

254
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,520
up specifically about DNS SEC and how to
mitigate some of the problems with it

255
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,720
and also i mean they're extremely
concerned about like dns are no

256
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,250
amplification attacks and so they talk
about that in some to sunlight as well

257
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,320
I'd be happy to you if you give your car
where I'll shoot some articles

258
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,789
everything would be very helpful

259
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:13,570
yes so the whole paper factory how you
see what do you mean exactly what you

260
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,889
mean like a wild card

261
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:22,240
yes I'm well the these specific if you
actually have a wild card you have

262
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,960
that's part of your response typically
that would actually tell you that's

263
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,679
where the wild card fits so you like a a
a system that night we implementing it

264
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:36,400
you know and say well actually just tell
you that it's doing wild cards

265
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,959
so this would be different that you
wouldn't know that like for example of

266
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,299
cloudflare strips that out completely so
that you handle that

267
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:57,889
and what about what do you mean that's
not that's pls that's not right and I

268
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:09,350
guess what is like workers we easily
write e I guess what was one

269
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,299
yes oh so what they what you're supposed
to do for the $YEAR white lies approach

270
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:19,039
right is that if you have if you like
what you use mp3 you return half is

271
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,640
right

272
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,980
so somebody asks for a dot-com you
instead of pointing them to the actual

273
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:30,799
next record you take BW . burger and
then you hash that right so your

274
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,418
passions like you know obviously not
related in more and so theoretically

275
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,990
shouldn't be able to follow that the the
problem there is that means that your

276
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,260
dns server needs to have the sign here
to be able to do that

277
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:48,650
all right all i think i almost made it
in to the original time window so I

278
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,679
thank you so much you have any other
questions I'll be outside

279
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,370
make sure your time
