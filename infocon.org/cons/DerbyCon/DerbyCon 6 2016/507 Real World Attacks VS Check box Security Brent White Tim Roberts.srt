1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,589
alright well i know we're already a
little over so i guess we'll go ahead

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,960
and get started because of this to
stable talk but this this talk was

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,340
originally designed to be more of our
long talks so we cut down like

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,630
seventy-five percent of entrusting put
into as much as we can so if you guys

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,529
have any specific questions or anything
feel free to ask us afterwards grow

6
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,448
pretty powerful who are you no one
really cares we're just going to talk

7
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,700
about again we're going to talk about
pci baseline configuration things like

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,719
that versus real-world attacks on with
the tango checkbox security isn't a bad

9
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,690
start but it's just that start

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,968
I doesn't make your security I you know
it's not a comprehensive thing it's just

11
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,840
a start and tempest yeah duh you know
there's some that are genuinely

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,899
concerned when you do security most of
them are if you see a lot of

13
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,680
corporations they follow frameworks and
compliance and standards all we're doing

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,090
this pin test because of PCI compliant
and so that's the only driving factor

15
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,439
behind their security culture and that's
that's kind of what this talk is about

16
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,460
it is it's aiming at getting away from
just doing security for the sake of

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,979
insecurity and minimum efforts and then
overlooking some possible compromises

18
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:27,090
yep so yeah I get this for the record is
again really high-level don't want to

19
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,970
read all of the points one by one but
it's really hard to cut all this stuff

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,100
down really quick you feel like anything
about threats limitations equals a false

21
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,630
sense of security

22
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,220
you know hey I did a pcr a pentax ok
cool what you do with this segmentation

23
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,869
testing that's cool we just networks
scans and tests

24
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:55,350
here's this nasus output in this 50-page
no pen test report and then they accept

25
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,219
that this is the way it works in q SI is
oftentimes will be like okay that's good

26
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,259
to go and then this company and the
client those that you know may not have

27
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,360
a full grasp of the risks are out there
except that ok cool we're good and it's

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,660
installing this fall securities I going
to self-defense class

29
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,809
making one self-defense class and I'm
good to go because i know three

30
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:23,220
techniques and this just not how it
works so i talked about scoping clients

31
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,220
often are very ports coping I they come
in and say hey we're a huge network but

32
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,989
here are four hundred IPS and oh yeah at
the domain controller is out of scope so

33
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,580
don't hit that ok well not connected to
your network then so and you know those

34
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,099
are things to consider like what are you
putting in the scope that you've got you

35
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,090
know I attackers they often take the
approach of you know focusing on low

36
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,950
hanging fruit so they come in and
they're able to plug in at and they are

37
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,910
they look at all the things that you
excluded the Assessors from looking at

38
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,239
at there's so much that's left wide open
so you know well even with a low-hanging

39
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,989
fruit you know it's not always when we
think of loading free we think oh ok

40
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,049
well this is an outdated apache web
server this they didn't have this

41
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,610
Microsoft patch or whatever just the
easy easy easy exploitable stuff below

42
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,519
hanging fruit is beyond just the
technical aspect when you look at

43
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,209
security threats you look at social
engineering is one of the main comp

44
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,950
catalyst for compromises right and
oftentimes they don't include that in

45
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,940
those tests they don't include it in the
networking that our perp in tests they

46
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,709
just focus on okay well segmentation and
I'm not harping just on pci this is for

47
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,700
a lot of standards even if you look at
NIST and stop people just use this and

48
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,890
they just go bioorg out of compliance or
we do you do we fell here that's all I

49
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,328
worry about it's all you worry about is
your great card you know and that

50
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,760
doesn't embody the full encompasses
thing of security culture and then

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,679
there's the whole idea of hey let's make
sure we get this checkbox checked so

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,430
that we're not having to pay money and
fines and that's their whole motivator

53
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:10,260
in you know a and you know their
security so a legitimate concerns for

54
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,480
the company so say your bank

55
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,548
obviously you're legitimate concern is
not letting attacker get to client

56
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,710
information credit card numbers things
like that so you've got to got to

57
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,739
consider these things whenever you're
having a penetration test done

58
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,420
you know just come in and say hey at ok
is trying to get your domain admin you

59
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,550
know that might not be that the jackpot
for the point of the assessment you've

60
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,400
got to consider you know why are you
having this test perform so you know and

61
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,330
ends outside of just you know the why I
identifying those risk and in thinking

62
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,969
outside of the box thinking outside of
the store

63
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,290
I don't want them to get access to this
is my most sensitive area around since

64
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,000
the data thinking about the smaller stop
it is a low-hanging fruit that's often

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,800
the the window the break to get into the
big you know metal building right over i

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,370
mean it's it's it's the easy way in and
a lot of people overlook that stuff

67
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,150
especially when it comes to the human
element of social engineering and

68
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:20,229
physical state security as well so I
something that I here all the time in it

69
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,790
and it's really stupid is when someone
comes in and they have on scan and they

70
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,800
pass it off as a pen test so just to be
clear a bone scan is not a penetration

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,110
test I make sure you have accessories
that are actually exporting things are

72
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,620
actually checking out things and not
just you know coming in and running

73
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,960
messages or you know in map or something
like that and then giving you all the

74
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:51,489
the output from that so and then you
know IP range versus individual ip's so

75
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,600
again this is kind of what I've touched
on a few minutes ago they only provide

76
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,670
certainties why not just give us the
laksa you know what is coming there like

77
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,540
a real world attacker would do whatever
they can get

78
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,070
we're going to go after so I stop
limiting the Assessors as well

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,469
anyone in the risk with that I know from
some kind of the blue team side as you

80
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,340
know you're gonna break supple well you
don't want you to hit this box we won't

81
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,330
don't want you to do this because you
know this is a legacy application and

82
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,770
you know it's been sitting on this
ancient artifact forever and always

83
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,250
touching it because you might break it
and that's when you need to look at

84
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,850
yourself you know your infrastructure if
it's that easy to knock something over

85
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:39,470
to you know there's a risk their denial
of service is very very often

86
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,000
it is not included in pen test at least
the ones we do because people are

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
frightened mile service you can run
checks all you want but does it actually

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,960
work you know things like that and
setting this up there safe ways of doing

89
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,969
this if you do have a dev environment or
you know the test environment there's

90
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,650
ways of doing this replicating that same
kind of threat even outside of just the

91
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,969
human elements

92
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,470
yeah it's Tim talked about you know a
legacy systems and things like that at

93
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,310
what does erat development lifecycle
look like with your applications and

94
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,370
things are you do you have patch
management are you actually keeping

95
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,720
those things update and keeping an eye
on that or do you just wait until once a

96
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,670
year when a group of guys come in and
and do an assessment and say hey here is

97
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,950
a thousand outdated you know whatever so
you got to keep keep touch on those

98
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,849
things you gotta make sure to to keep
them up-to-date and follow through with

99
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:39,200
those in legacy understand that that's a
neat for certain things but i really

100
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,030
mean you can't get something redevelop
to secure something especially if it's

101
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,390
that important that you have to keep it
around that long maybe put some effort

102
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,860
into fixing that a long time ago
security was always kind of at the

103
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,610
bottom of the totem pole when it came to
priority is production production or

104
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,100
whatever at least in my experiences and
i think that you know because of these

105
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,479
big compromises that you see you know
it's it's becoming a lot more prevalent

106
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,550
and important it's raising out finally
interior so you do have ways to justify

107
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,190
doing more extensive stuff like this and
go on to the next slide here are you

108
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,280
know we mentioned weighing you're
risking such but the most important

109
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,950
thing I think on this slide is the
comprehensive security awareness

110
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,330
training program

111
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,510
most of the time people just say oh yeah
we do an annual security awareness

112
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,010
training we have some online quiz they
click through they send blah blah

113
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:37,520
supervisor hey they did this they got an
80 out of 100 it happens and then thats

114
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,770
that's fine but you just recycling the
same old junk and I'm forgive me for

115
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,000
saying that but you know a lot of times
it's the same old stop content of

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,080
generic security awareness stuff or
straight out of your policies and a lot

117
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,000
of corporate Burbage thrown into it

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,920
but you miss a lot of connecting with
the people and saying hey here's here's

119
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,400
some threads here some real life
examples here's your stomach don't ya

120
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,329
know they can apply to your personal
life to even outside of work

121
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,760
we're all part of the human firewall and
so prevalent as one of the first layers

122
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,010
of security for whatever your compliance
or whatever is 0 or pci tells you to

123
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:22,970
test its it's the culturing and shaping
your your employee body into into really

124
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:30,410
supporting that you're going to like my
blog uh yeah so incident handling and

125
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,839
response you guys use that covered

126
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:39,440
you know what do you do when shit hits
the fan I so partial disclosure for his

127
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,880
pleasure going in cold so when you have
an assessment you know what what is it

128
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,110
are you providing a scope or they just
plugging in and seeing what they can get

129
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,120
to or are you providing you know full
code for code reviews and everything so

130
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,620
you've got to look at what you know what
you would have done what needs to happen

131
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,870
as far as like your your current
security posture for your company if

132
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,780
you've never done in the assessments or
anything before you probably want to

133
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,550
consider what can you do to start from
the ground up instead of just what can

134
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:16,219
we do right now to just get a check box
so you know i know some of the way so

135
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,370
how do we handle incident handling and
response

136
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,390
you know I know some tests are only like
a week-long right you can spend that

137
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,900
first day just doing it from an external
perspective if you're you know if you're

138
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,699
doing kind of a partial whitelist had no
shining type of approach they're still

139
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,240
weighs 22 still kind of have that view
outside of it

140
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,480
I'm you have granted you don't have as
much time to try to do that but even I

141
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,500
even with on-site stuff you're doing a
red team work some kind of covert

142
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,970
physical or social engineering having I
know oftentimes we use the fake letter

143
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,480
of authorization to test incident
response so we'll do stop to try to

144
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,870
intentionally get caught and then they
catch us you know we give them the fake

145
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,589
letter and they look at it and oh yeah
you're good to go and they don't call

146
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:01,130
follow through so know that your
incident response sucks when it comes to

147
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,030
that layer of security don't just test
the the technical layer of security

148
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,529
because you know

149
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,970
once you're in you drop some dropbox or
whatever then you know you're you're in

150
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,410
no we're good

151
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,769
because you have to be connected to our
network we have an open network jack in

152
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:19,819
your lobby that has dhcp connected to
your production network and kidding me

153
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,829
in the getting and that's happened

154
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:29,748
see ya next to the water home so scopus
pentesting this obviously i think is

155
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:34,220
ideal but when you look at the reality
of things that's usually a lot of money

156
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:42,949
usually not in the budget unfortunately
so let's say I deal you know scope was

157
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:47,180
confessing so you include the entire
gamut let us close to social engineering

158
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,519
engineering let's come in look at
physical what is everything how can we

159
00:11:52,519 --> 00:12:01,009
try to gain unauthorized access into
anything obviously again unless you have

160
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:05,990
more money than you know what to do with
that's not necessarily always possible

161
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,459
but definitely things to consider
instead of just focusing on an internal

162
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:15,888
assessment as 10 and I've talked about
also include the other areas as you're

163
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:20,629
able to know there's a lot of pentest
companies out there that do just you

164
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:23,750
know for their external penetration sex
but you just focus on the network and

165
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,649
application layers they don't they don't
include that social engineering aspect

166
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:32,750
and you know you have to wonder with the
amount of compromises visit you know

167
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,189
that happened and it being because the
fishing or cold calls and spirit

168
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:43,129
whatever that this stuff is is a big
issue and it's time for you know not

169
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,720
only is his pen testers but you know the
blue side that you guys you know we have

170
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,319
to work together to try to understand
what you're trying to protect and how

171
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:55,128
you can protect it and it's not this you
know Jason Street an awesome talk i

172
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:59,329
think it was at a one of the b-sides
worrying that he had talked about this

173
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:03,829
red vs blue thing and getting rid of
that nonsense and I think it's so

174
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:06,679
important especially for this kind of
check box approach that we get rid of

175
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,069
this

176
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:11,628
well here's our safe here's how we can
safely talk to these pentester guys and

177
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:15,199
what we kind of want to do and really
just listen and and have open

178
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:18,199
conversation dialogue that's the most
important thing

179
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,790
and you know something I've heard to its
get analogy it's like at whenever we

180
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,660
going to do an internal contester
external or whatever it is you have the

181
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,199
guys that have worked at the company for
years and they they maybe even helped

182
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,020
set up the network and so they're
they're confident that you're not going

183
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,160
to find anything or maybe they don't
want the extra work when you do and so

184
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,910
it's basically the equivalent and
walking into a place and telling someone

185
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,449
that their baby is ugly it doesn't
usually you know it doesn't go over very

186
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,710
well so just kind of changing that
mentality of you know help us help you

187
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,010
is also a good way to approach it

188
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:59,400
so we've already a very touching this 30
can just walk in

189
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:05,790
probably you know I have RFID corners
and on stuff but you care so you don't

190
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,329
need it because oftentimes people just
they don't pay attention to the color of

191
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,940
the badge and sound anything like that
they just see that you have something

192
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,790
around your neck looks like kind of what
they have around their neck and you're

193
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,959
good to go and but people don't you know
consider that you can have all the no

194
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,520
piggybacking no tailgating signs you
want but when people become this very

195
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,390
routine especially as a large volume of
traffic coming in and out of places or

196
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,699
there's a lot of contractors that come
in and out

197
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,220
it's so easy to just walk in here and so
you know even if you you have a guy on

198
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,660
site during a test

199
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,469
no hey he's here for partial disclosure
of my nose hearing sounds the visitor

200
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,390
log Bob all give the pen tester day to
just see if he can walk in and get to

201
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,800
wherever it is he normally plugs in if
he does then you kind of gotta you

202
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,790
weaseled a little free assessment of
that kind of the first layer of security

203
00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:05,969
on our internal network test at school
so at X definitely you know let let the

204
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,530
person in the assessment look at your
digital footprint yo utilizing open

205
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,910
source intelligence are they able to
quickly find anything that's unsecured

206
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:20,459
or maybe your developer ask for help in
a few years ago on a development forum

207
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,260
and provided legitimate database
credentials for someone to help and

208
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,740
those are still active and I've actually
found that through

209
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,300
web assessment before unfortunately I
you know look for things like that or

210
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,149
I've even found usernames or database
again database credentials or even the

211
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:42,600
entire database schema from someone
asking for help and that stuff was

212
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,399
archived and no longer required access
to that email account thanks to google

213
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,170
and i was able to utilize those
credentials just from doing some basic

214
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:59,370
searching through the internet again and
that kind of opens up like let us let us

215
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,310
go after anything that you have like
anything that you own

216
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,630
that's connected to the Internet let us
see you know especially internet things

217
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,670
mean a lot of that stuff sucks it's
pretty easy to get into that leverage

218
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,829
those things so those are just things to
consider when you are having an

219
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,089
assessment coming out

220
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:24,420
don't you know the limited to kind of
screw yourself over essentially an

221
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,969
attacker doesn't have the rules of
engagement

222
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,930
they don't care they have all the time
in the world to if you know if they're

223
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:36,599
sitting there slowly picking at you and
you know so if we consider this stuff

224
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:43,470
psycho ok what we want to a good real
world view help honor we are ok cool so

225
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,839
here's kind of our attack methodology
but we use you guys get one we're not

226
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,740
really comfortable with this because it
can make our employees not trust are so

227
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:58,230
you know we can't do this because of
blah blah blah and I'm sorry but you're

228
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,329
not getting a real world first attack
the advantage of you in and even if you

229
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:07,589
have one contestant come in maybe that
pen tester didn't not going to find

230
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,550
everything that some you know
government-funded cyberterrorism group

231
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,899
is going to find so it's things like
this you need to consider too and that's

232
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,110
why I think you're also going to see
that advanced persistent threat testing

233
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:25,290
our apt testing is becoming more is
being more accepted from from clients

234
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,550
there there little open to doing like a
longer engagement like a three to

235
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:35,909
six-month engagement or simple yeah then
a you know like don't they don't carry

236
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:41,950
the fish so a lot of times with social
engineering stuff they will exclude CEOs

237
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,880
or anyone sort of in that arena and the
executives because they don't want to

238
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,540
end up person they don't want to
inconvenience that person an attacker

239
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,200
doesn't care that's usually the first
person that you offer anyway who has the

240
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,550
most access let's go out for the admin
group or the CEO who feels like he also

241
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:04,330
also have admin access for whatever
reason stronger security awareness

242
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,770
programs you know if you have remote
offices outside of the corporate office

243
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,820
and you have people coming in then what
happens is you get caught in this grinds

244
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,810
in this routine you do your thing and if
that routines disrupted sometimes you

245
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,460
don't even notice

246
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,470
I you know for example I recent
engagement idea is a social engineering

247
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,880
engagement I had a keylogger on me and
they didn't have badges but I made a

248
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,940
fake badge anyway and said I was from
corporate and I walked in and it was

249
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,660
just two ladies working office i told
him i was there to fix the network

250
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,140
connectivity had they been having some
issues and of course everybody has never

251
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,630
connectivity issues and let me plug in
and do my thing but you know they didn't

252
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,140
ask

253
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,890
they didn't look at you know where those
badges come from or who are you again

254
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,780
for calling us are out of coffee

255
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,220
I also brought him coffee to like I at I
just like was really tired and she was

256
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,420
gonna get well I don't use this and i
got like three cups of copies take as an

257
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:05,500
example so but yeah you know it'sit's
you're not a jerk for a it what happens

258
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,560
is some employees or they feel like
they're being a jerk question anybody or

259
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,879
challenging by oh this dudes cock
muhammad and his badge

260
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,180
well I've seen him here before several
times i know that he works here

261
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,480
how do you know he didn't get fired like
the day before and he's now you know

262
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,140
really mad you know it's things like
this to consider outside of just the

263
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,200
generic vanilla security awareness
programs it

264
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,340
I'm so regular regular reporting for
compliance broader windows open scopes

265
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,689
specific drills etc these are different
ways of doing a more robust security

266
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,290
awareness program one of the things that
that we do is we have a training where

267
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,340
it's kind of a Q&A a hacker Q&A you have
a you know your PowerPoint you talk

268
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,449
about different ways you do stuff and
they get to see tools be demonstrated or

269
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,850
whatever this is always a good way it
leaves a

270
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,199
the impression doing on-site assessment
or whatever that involves like social

271
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,520
engineering is always great because
sometimes you can have that as part of

272
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,300
your training

273
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,879
well last year branch and she had
whatever you know here's what happened

274
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,030
you are you allowed so and so you're not
pointing out individuals being get the

275
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,649
idea that sticks in the people that
that's that's real things that happens

276
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:22,210
those companies to your oh wow I didn't
know that happen that's crazy and it

277
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,080
sticks with people more than just
checking on some you know freaking

278
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,169
interactive quiz that you have to take
once a year

279
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,610
yeah and something that at M&I like to
do with that security awareness training

280
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:38,770
that we provide is that when we're going
in and we actually show people okay here

281
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,150
this isn't under the door tool

282
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,170
here's how it works and show video or
these are lockpick set pic walk and

283
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,880
another thing that really gets attention
is when you have a rogue access point on

284
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,660
or something like the Wi-Fi pineapple
and while you're giving the top you're

285
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,220
actually getting people's phones to
connect to you and then you can show

286
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,540
that on the screen and they say oh you
know crap that's my phone

287
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,920
well then you have their attention or
staying with bluetooth things like that

288
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,820
and like 10 set it goes beyond the
boring

289
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:15,070
I you know just click power . test that
you do sitting at a computer where your

290
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:20,320
everybody just you know searches doesn't
control left to the PDF document and

291
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,580
poster with a hook right officials are
not really studying like going to study

292
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,270
this I've gotta gotta really pass this
test today they don't care they just

293
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,750
want to move through it but when you can
give them a real world example like that

294
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,560
you're going to get their attention and
they're going to remember that more so

295
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,820
again that kind of goes well you know
doing the same old thing with the same

296
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,770
animal results not this security
awareness begin with your internal

297
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,030
external assessments and so on you know
in the disaster recovery to disaster

298
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,230
recovery business continuity oftentimes
you have to do a test without you have

299
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,460
to do your annual disaster recovery test
or whatever you can always include this

300
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,690
as part of your off your tabletop
exercises and stuff to you know think

301
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,680
outside of the box outside of just the
kind of standard structure of security

302
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,590
awareness and I mean

303
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,168
disaster recovery and business
continuity is a part of that especially

304
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:16,860
when you look at denial of service or
physical threats you what all the boils

305
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,840
down to is culture and installing this
security culture into your company into

306
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,189
your executives the guys that make you
guys and gals that make the decisions

307
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,120
it's very important that you know
they're on board and i think this is

308
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,559
always a good i open ur c right to do
this and at one time we did a wireless

309
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,309
security assessment one of the
executives we have like an evil AP up

310
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:42,240
and connected to it we're going to put
out some is a is exchanged credentials

311
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,490
and so here he was very open to what we
had to say after we were able to do that

312
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,330
there was another time that the point
contact you know he was like yeah you

313
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,789
guys can do whatever you're not gonna be
able to do whatever you're not gonna be

314
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,480
able to do anything to gain access to
anything i love when they say that in

315
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,309
the HR room like where they keep all the
employee files lights were all but it

316
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:08,010
was opal our cubicles and the cubicles
are blocking that door so they can see

317
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:12,419
unless they stood up so I snuck in there
as the digging through and found his

318
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:17,130
employee file and I went over to relate
on his desk musical uses like man you

319
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,549
know it's it's more than just that it's
more than just what you're thinking of a

320
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:25,320
pen test and/or physical assessment or
whatever you shape your verbiage you

321
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,370
used two types of attack methodologies
that you guys have but you know it's

322
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,209
more than that and i think that it's
important that we always as an infosec

323
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,860
community office defense whatever
executives you know people that never

324
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,370
touch the keyboard but we all get on
board with you know listening to every

325
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,899
everybody and having open dialogue about
real rescue real threats and how can we

326
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:52,469
help us and still this culture and our
people it so again that we had to cut

327
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:57,929
this down and extensively so I have that
is basically it for us and now we're at

328
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:02,309
times if anybody has any questions you
will be always want to chat for a bit

329
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,658
but i think yes

330
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:04,529
yeah except
