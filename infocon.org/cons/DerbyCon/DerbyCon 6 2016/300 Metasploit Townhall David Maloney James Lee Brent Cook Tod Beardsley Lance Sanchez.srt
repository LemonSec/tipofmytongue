3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,239

been working on metasploit for about

12
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,430
seven years now 5 of it getting paid by
rapid seven so that's pretty good gig

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:01:04,650
when I am a man such as been working
with rapid 7 44 years and i'm the lead

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:13,140
software engineer on the best-looking
hey that's me i am now the community

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,670
manager i also still do some development
from time to time but i spent most of my

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,119
day on Twitter these days I'm really I'm
really good at twitter i think yeah I've

17
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,960
been working on medically for about nine
years i started submitting patches and

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:40,530
2007 document assistance 2008 started
with rapid7 2009 handsome man now I work

19
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,520
in marketing now so i used to be an
engineer then I took a rope chain to the

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,380
knee or something

21
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,640
yeah i've been at rapid7 for
six-and-a-half years commit on my

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,229
display for seven years

23
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,179
we're actually I think we're like AG
radiation of like number of commits like

24
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,689
on average almost exactly now like I
very few and brent has quite a few so

25
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:07,979
that was the joke right

26
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,978
anyway going on

27
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,359
howdy hi I'm brenta no one calls me
buster be but that's why i'm online and

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,590
so I've only been with metasploit and
rapid seven for two years but I'm next

29
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,590
to the manager of the team so yeah

30
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,330
hi everybody it's very good to meet you
and work with you have seen a lot of

31
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,580
awesome familiar faces out there and get
some wings out so hey let's get going

32
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,209
man

33
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:41,670
ok so we talk about who we are but I the
faces of medicine . itself there are

34
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,369
actually very numerous I the last time I
looked get upset we had about 363 actual

35
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,880
contributors to the project which is
quite a few ah so I went through and

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,280
took a look at who the top 100 of our
contributors were at least the ones who

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,350
actually had pictures on their github
accounts so here's all the faces of the

38
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:10,170
top 100 people who actually had a github
avatar which we got a nice big wall of

39
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,518
people here but if we are if we go ahead
and we take out all the people who are

40
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,350
who are or have been rapid seven
employees we still have a lot of faces

41
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,140
their medicine boy has been and always
will be driven by the community by you

42
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,730
guys sitting in the audience and anyone
watching this on the livestream we're

43
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,290
watching the video afterwards I and so
we can't do this without you guys and

44
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,790
that's basically the whole point of this
event tonight are today it's not tonight

45
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,190
but uh is just for us to sit down and
basically talk with you guys are our

46
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:52,380
community our users are contributors and
the reason that we do this so I this is

47
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,579
where we're going to open it up to you
guys here but i wanna just put down some

48
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:59,519
ground rules first

49
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,290
no trolling seriously and RP they're
going to be people who have serious

50
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,910
questions and feedback and as much as i
enjoy control like please don't waste

51
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:18,089
their time I and also we're not here to
troubleshoot so I you know where that we

52
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,880
have a lot of resources available if
you're having like a specific problem

53
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
with you can't get some module to work
or something like that so there's a lot

54
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,080
of $STREET avenue

55
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,919
use for that and yeah but do ask us any
questions that are on your mind make

56
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,240
suggestions

57
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,840
tell us what you love tell us what you
hate tell us what we suck at I'm promise

58
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,060
we won't get offended I and what may be
just as importantly tell us when

59
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,960
somebody does something better than us
and why do you think they're better than

60
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,539
us because it's the only way we'll learn
I and tell us what problems you guys

61
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,938
have that we're not solving for you
right now

62
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:57,090
so with that I open it up to the floor

63
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,448
who wants to say something ask something

64
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:05,129
yeah go ahead

65
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,500
the question was about other modules and
and whether they're going to be can

66
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:24,539
going to be enhanced and and continued
we don't have any current plans for that

67
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:31,650
I they I i think the reason they are
primarily useful is because they're

68
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,719
they're very targeted so as opposed to
something some general fuzz like peach

69
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,129
or something

70
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:43,259
they're very targeted they already know
how the protocol works so the fact that

71
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,580
we have other protocols that don't have
any hazards associated with them means

72
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,008
that there's definitely room for for
growth there for improvement but like i

73
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:58,469
said we don't have any direct plans for
that that would be a great place to get

74
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:02,219
started contributing and I hate to be
the guy who says patches accepted but I

75
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:07,680
say that all the time because patches
accepted adding adding something like

76
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,889
that i think would be valuable to a lot
of people so if if you're looking for a

77
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,960
place to get started there's a great
suggestion

78
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,969
also if there's like something specific
you want to see a buzzer for you can

79
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:25,650
always you know hit us up on IRC the
community site or or even open and get

80
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,179
up issue and say like this is a thing
that I need arm and we'll we'll take it

81
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,469
under advisement

82
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:35,590
yeah

83
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:55,510
that out what are you running framework
on on cali so we actually don't control

84
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:04,030
our packaging on cali so they decide
when packages get pushed and we've we've

85
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,599
worked with them before and will
continue to work with them we're trying

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,530
to make it as stable as possible on that
platform because i know we have a whole

87
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:18,280
lot of users there so I'm sorry bro but
what version of calculus are you on the

88
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,650
latest cali rolling okay because I
thought that most of those issues had

89
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,380
actually been resolved on cali rolling
we did have some issues uh about a year

90
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:36,159
or two ago with the way we're doing cali
packaging basically we're trying to be

91
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,390
too heavily involved i think in the
process instead of just letting the cali

92
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:46,240
guys do their thing and we we sat down
with them and and talked about it and I

93
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,690
basically let them just control that
process and I think it's been a lot

94
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,650
better since they just took over so
different

95
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:15,219
well that's good i'm glad it's not all
doom and gloom that would be bad i would

96
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:22,150
like to conduct a very unscientific poll
of just show hands who runs metasploit

97
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,190
as the cali package binary from from
their sources

98
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:35,020
I I know you do ok alright so like at
White who does like a framework check

99
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,468
out like straight from github about
equal and anything at who's never used

100
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,390
my display before and you're in the
wrong room

101
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:53,589
ok alright so about like 40 40 20 ish i
guess of this completely representative

102
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:58,329
of the industry audience actually i'm
curious it is even use the packages at

103
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:04,449
rapid7 puts out the the open source
packages crickets while interesting ok

104
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,660
nobody knows about them want to talk
about bread maybe no one knows that

105
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:13,990
medicine that actually rapid7 builds
debian RPM OSX and windows packages of

106
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:20,380
the open source and their updated every
single day doesn't know that I know are

107
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,950
very interesting that's good that's
really good feedback here they've been

108
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:29,740
out for almost a year now so we're kind
of at least a good betta run so it

109
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,079
sounds like we need to promote a lot
more

110
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:42,609
yeah would you encourage people running
cali to use the Debian packages to use

111
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,450
the the rabbit seven matches up you know
Kelly does a pretty good job they have

112
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,620
their own Fork of metasploit if you go
to their get repos you can find it gets

113
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,790
updated whenever we tagged it every
friday at $TIME noon so they do a pretty

114
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,140
good job i would say based on my
observations from cali users that report

115
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,550
bugs and paddock couple things that come
out one of them is sometimes we'll make

116
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:09,430
a change like for instance we change to
how the version file was formatted

117
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,930
Colorado said script on it as part of
their packaging it changed him support

118
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,949
mms f5 accidentally so everyone can pick
files onto msn five

119
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,420
it took us about two weeks to figure out
what the hell went wrong but we'll fix

120
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,589
that now sometimes we break modules and
that's kind of a there's there's over

121
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,730
3,000 modules medicine flight there's
something that's going to be someone's

122
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,000
of pride and joy but doesn't get looked
at by everybody

123
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,050
so sometimes that happens we try to fix
it as soon as possible if you run the

124
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:46,209
the rapid seven pack catch so there's a
pro and con bed bug fixes right away but

125
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:50,890
you also you get the excitement all that
stuff so so yeah I recommend it if

126
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,480
you're unlucky open to if you're running
like red hat running kali I'd still

127
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,560
kinda recommend use all these packages
just because it integrates well with

128
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,369
Seether Armitage install and integrates
well with other tools because they have

129
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,280
a specific location they expect
everything to be n we did work together

130
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,790
we made the database management tools
the same between the two packages you

131
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,790
don't learn a new way to database so
things like that

132
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:29,020
I'm sorry yet it and they work with msl
go right on windows and on OSX so yeah

133
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,970
it's an extra natural light . PKG file
it'll install metasploit even as a GUI

134
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:40,150
so it's really sexy looking we involved
like the the marketing teams style guide

135
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,220
for the right colors and everything so
sweet it is bonafide so anyway check it

136
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,220
out it's even open source so you can
improve the installer if you want

137
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:25,850
can be completely honest you know

138
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:34,339
ah so the question was about basically
rqe process and testing and automated

139
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,660
testing so i'll let Lance answer some of
this so we do a lot of testing on the

140
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,199
pro product there's minimal testing on
the framework with mostly make sure that

141
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,839
unit tests pass things like that go
through we have next to no exploit tests

142
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,830
I they're hard to set up it's something
that I've been trying to get more time

143
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,640
to work on but it is painful to go
through and verify that this exploit

144
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,199
works every time

145
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,950
so it is on the roadmap something we'd
like to get done

146
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,149
I don't know what's gonna happen i'll
talk a little bit about that we've

147
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:08,570
actually one of the things that we've a
lot of a test environment surrounded

148
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,560
around like medical able to windows XP
that kind of stuff we found is like

149
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,920
that's not really relevant to anyone's
real environment you know you guys

150
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,890
probably figured that out five years ago
it's like that yeah I don't run into

151
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,930
that many XP boxes these days and if i
do that it's not you know it's important

152
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,339
it's like making sure 2012 2008 of
Windows 10 always can continue to work

153
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:32,149
called modules so actually we've been
working on this level three which is

154
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:37,190
going to be windows and linux based and
that's sort of our testbed for future

155
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,420
kind of unit tests and stuff and so it's
got a lot of interesting stuff in it

156
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,479
we also we also have a lab environment

157
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,209
well I in our office that has a whole
wide variety of various platforms of

158
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:56,839
every version of windows back to 2000
sp4 are a bunch of different linux

159
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,829
targets and things like that we we try
and do as much manual testing as we can

160
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:05,270
especially for things like the SMB login
module that you mentioned are we trying

161
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,740
tested as many different scenarios as we
possibly can unfortunately sometimes we

162
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,410
we miss things are an example would be
that we recently overhauled how we do

163
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,930
ssh and we just we didn't think about a
couple scenarios that could happen where

164
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,399
like if you did

165
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,550
SSH over a proxy pivot like with this
one piece still work and so you know

166
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,079
sometimes you get a little bit of a gun

167
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,560
your face because you missed those
scenarios and also sometimes we just

168
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,510
don't have the software anymore

169
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,410
like if you get some old exploit that
requires a specific piece of software

170
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,689
sometimes it's really hard to find it
again that answer your question or

171
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:20,490
this sounds like

172
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,660
for the community manager yes some of
that is so the question was how do we

173
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,579
communicate the the the big
architectural changes that are happening

174
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,910
like with the login scanners a lot of
that will show up on blog posts i do a

175
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,410
weekly wrapup I i call it weekly but
it's actually about bi-weekly because

176
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,750
i'm a slacker

177
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:52,460
so watch the blog posts are occasionally
post things on Twitter to the issues q

178
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,590
is going to be a flood of information by
all that stuff shows up there so if

179
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,590
you're if you're willing to wait through
that and everything will show up in the

180
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:09,500
pull request queue at the very least
we're we're starting to to look at ways

181
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,360
of of getting our our development
process more out in the open

182
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:20,120
we use we use our ticketing system
internally because that's what the

183
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:26,090
company uses but it doesn't translate
well to get her issues so we're trying

184
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:30,380
to trying to come up with a good way to
make that a little more open a little

185
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:36,980
more transparent and we've looked at we
looked at waffle mayo do we look at

186
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:46,400
anything else for that real scripts okay
so yeah we're trying and if you have a

187
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,720
good suggestion on where that should be
communicated or how best to do it please

188
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,770
let me know tomorrow

189
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,850
egyptair is giving a talk called the new
shiny and metasploit so you might want

190
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:09,349
to go to that one too because it will
talk about the new shiny and metasploit

191
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:12,349
and so just gonna do because every year
for the rest of your life and you'll at

192
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:19,189
least get one year fidelity and and so
to reiterate a point that will probably

193
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,600
hit a lot of times

194
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,909
testing if that's an area that you have
any interest or knowledge of is another

195
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,870
great place to get started contributing
and like it might not seem as glamorous

196
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,590
as writing like the next heartbleed or
shell shock or whatever

197
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:41,739
uh yes yes yeah we all know about your
opinions on heartbleed are my point is

198
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,590
that it may not seem like as glamorous
but it's actually really really

199
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,330
important that we continue to find good
ways of adding test coverage and every

200
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,629
every commit pushed back to master on
framework triggers a continuous

201
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,309
integration build of all the unit tests
but as Lance was saying like functional

202
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,980
testing is still something we're trying
to get our head wrapped around how to do

203
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,150
it and reliable way especially for
things like SMB based exploits like

204
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:16,179
something goes the least bit wrong and
that target ends up in a weird state and

205
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,179
then like you can't do anything with it
to reboot the machine

206
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,890
I so if that's an area you're interested
in I'm just also say that you know

207
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,540
that's another place we have happily
take contributions from outside of rapid

208
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,920
74 as well

209
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,510
anyone else

210
00:18:46,210 --> 00:19:00,940
if he uh there's a there's a good talk
by one of our forearm my contributors

211
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,110
coming up soon

212
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,129
you can check it out . stalk which is
going to be about some android

213
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,930
exploitation we have a lot of awesome
stuff planned for android we also have

214
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,650
been working on some some native
interpreters that can be injected into

215
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:22,600
potentially iOS into linux into DC
systems into all sorts of variety

216
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,810
systems we've been doing some internal
testing women we also have a public

217
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:31,179
project that's been out for maybe two
months yourself so I think we've got a

218
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,200
lot of movement around IOT I've got a
backpack stuffed full of IOT devices

219
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,920
that i'm going to be hopefully demoing
later on Sunday when we talk about some

220
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,050
new pilot stuff so I think that's going
to be a very important area for meds .

221
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,159
moving forward is basically doing a
router embedded that kind of

222
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,600
exploitation and shirt showing the
weaknesses that we have within the

223
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,889
ecosystem within everything from
printers to know your baby monitors that

224
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:00,040
sort of thing so yeah I think that's
only a big place and mess with me going

225
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,590
in the future I think post exploitation
is probably going to be home more and

226
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,429
more important as we move forward and
basically improving the data models of

227
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,240
people keep track of all the crazy stuff
that they find on the network

228
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,920
I think those are probably going to be
more of where we focus and not quite as

229
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,260
much on remote no access bones and that
sort of thing um I I think expectations

230
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,520
still very important but it's somewhere
there there are lots of really easy ways

231
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,760
to get the things as well so I think
that's kind of where we're going to msy

232
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,760
going as we move forward

233
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:44,709
like I think the stuff that Brent and
spin spirit was a print anoche and too

234
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:51,580
right yeah and I've been doing a lot of
work in android in particular over the

235
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:58,179
last what you're in a half really right
that's all project metal and and so

236
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:03,340
search for like metasploit metal and you
will you can read all about that the NSA

237
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,990
little yes

238
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,140
and yah metal like this anyway

239
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:15,219
the interesting thing about android is
like you know android today and iOS

240
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:21,070
today they're they're hard to exploit
you know unless your name is Jada but

241
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,050
the fact is that a lot of the IOT stuff
that you see that's running Android

242
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,680
under the covers is super super super
old Android that will never ever get

243
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,900
updated so it's all android 40 Force
operator or 44 is about the limit of

244
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,010
what you're going to say I saw a
treadmill that was running android for

245
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:45,280
to perfect that right now like that we
all have our hatch bugs forever and so

246
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,020
that's that's a it's it's a target-rich
environment out there for for

247
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:55,150
android-powered devices that may not
necessarily be handsets but absolutely

248
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:00,970
talk on on your targets network and i
think the big thing with traditional

249
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,720
mobile landscape and say that's probably
going to be like looking at me like

250
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,470
you're an idiot here in a second but i
would say that it seems like the attack

251
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,550
surface on a lot of the mobile and
tablets and phones just doesn't seem to

252
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:18,340
be anywhere near as big as like a
traditional computer looking at JW make

253
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,220
sure he's not like you're completely out
of your mind

254
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:27,280
okay Jade of disagrees so I'm gonna stop
talking about it then because go CJ .

255
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,720
talk I don't say integration is going to
be a big part of metasploit move forward

256
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,220
integrating with other tools more
closely the thing is mr. white started

257
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,570
out you know ten years ago as a kind of
an omnibus like everything you could

258
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,129
think of everything from father's to
post exploitation to exploitation to

259
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,630
auxiliary modules to a zillion things
under the Sun we find is that these days

260
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,740
there are a lot of

261
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,040
very targeted projects out there that do
one thing and do one thing really well

262
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,620
and we basically kind of thinking why
don't we identify the things that we

263
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,090
kind of had now do so well and no
integrate with the thing that does it

264
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,480
better so we're talking about for
instance I make one suggestion

265
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,290
powershell is is there some amazing
frameworks out there you know i would

266
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,550
say like partial Empire is an incredible
tool a lot of us use it internally as

267
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,970
well and so we're looking at how can we
better integrate with powerful Empire so

268
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,900
if people into powerful exploitation why
reinvent the wheel inside of mass white

269
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,590
you know integrate better and so we were
thinking about adding new features you

270
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,129
think well is there someone who's done
it really well already

271
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,610
and how can we leverage that and make it
so people kind of a one-stop shop and

272
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,629
then and they can integrate with the
tools they like and still use mediswipe

273
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:47,740
for the places where it fits in and
that's things well anyone else back

274
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:54,489
yes

275
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:32,110
sometimes module deprecation happen when
we added module one place then we moved

276
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,290
to another place so we end up with two
modules that basically the exact same

277
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,399
thing so we usually try not to break
people's work flow by moving a module

278
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,730
and deleting the one so they got our
scripts whatever hard-coded to that

279
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,920
sometimes there will mostly module
consolidation where one module does

280
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,100
three things really well and there's
almost like little models that do one

281
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,100
thing kinda half well and that's where
some of those other applications come

282
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,899
from i think they're usually for the
best arm and then it kind of reduces the

283
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,620
number of what sort of like half way
modules that are there in the ecosystem

284
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,760
yes so so one of the recent examples was
a the old LSA secrets module that we

285
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,830
when we started looking at it turned out
like under certain circumstances it just

286
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,919
plain didn't work I and now we have many
cats integration so it just it made no

287
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,740
sense for us to have this this module
that we have written and to keep it here

288
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,820
just because it you know it was built
here when we had integration with a tool

289
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,909
that was custom-built for this purpose
kind of to what brent was saying a

290
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,650
minute ago and was better at it and yeah
I was it was better at it so like rather

291
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,740
than being like well we made this thing
so it's great we're like all right this

292
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:47,260
thing it's a little broken its old let's
just use many cats just do the things

293
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,430
that makes sense

294
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:53,080
I don't think like we like to talk about
how we continue to grow and we like to

295
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,040
it's like module numbers to talk about
that but i don't think there's like a

296
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,110
hard focus on increasing like just
driving that number up it's about what

297
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:06,520
makes sense and what's relevant and
we've always had sort of this weird

298
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:14,350
dichotomy of we have stuff in medicine
boy that is like old nt4 based exploits

299
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,629
and things that were like we have no way
of testing this really or like knowing

300
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,520
for sure if we ever break it like how do
we even know and so there's this weird

301
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,700
line that we're trying to figure out how
to walk of not taking away things that

302
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,180
people might still find usefulness nt4
systems are definitely out there are but

303
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,840
not have to try and like actively
maintained stuff that is essentially

304
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,800
impossible for

305
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,300
custom maintain your cover it

306
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:56,170
yeah crickets crickets bueller bueller
Brandon pirri more spinners ok

307
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:00,700
like all the lines of spinners patches
accepted I i work i will i will add a

308
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,490
command-line argument for you that will
just fill the screen with spinners well

309
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:23,530
it'll be the dash b perry option so the
questions about my talk on the new shiny

310
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:28,480
is it going to be new shiny that exists
or in shining is coming it all exists

311
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,480
I'm only talking about things that are
on master today

312
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:44,439
yeah so uh that the follow-up question
was about like what some of our plans

313
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,450
for the future and I'm gonna jump in
here real quick i know some of the other

314
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,780
guys can add some stuff but one of the
big things were actually focusing on

315
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,430
right now is sort of a major
architectural overhaul we spent a bunch

316
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:02,530
of time this year uh upgrading Ruby and
rails and all the back in dependencies

317
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,520
but now we're focusing on like breaking
our code up if you've been watching like

318
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,670
a lot of the wrecks libraries are
getting broken up into individual

319
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:15,430
rubygems and being giving their own
individual testing uh like their own

320
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,620
unit tests so that they run
independently and were looking in the

321
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,570
long-term to start breaking metasploit
up into more component pieces that

322
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:31,240
interoperate with each other instead of
this giant monolithic uh entity that you

323
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,140
know is a massive download every time
you updated its huge everything has to

324
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:41,620
load every time you started up arm and
so you know the conceptually I always

325
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,429
thought of Medicine Lake framework as
toolbox and I feel like what we've

326
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:49,570
created instead overtime organically has
become like a small of a Swiss Army

327
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,418
knife where it's all the tools in one

328
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:56,859
but you have to carry the whole thing
with you and each tool might not be the

329
00:28:56,859 --> 00:29:02,049
best tool for the job and I want to get
us i want to see us move back towards

330
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:07,119
being a toolbox with the right tools all
available there and you know you can

331
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,600
download it all together but then you
only need to grab the tool that you need

332
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,859
for that particular time you do you
think you had something you wanted to

333
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:22,869
add to that I'm yes all of that i'm also
were we're kind of in the background

334
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:29,109
working on one protocol support for smb2
on the that's been that's been in the

335
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:32,739
background has been in the works for a
long time because it's a big massive

336
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:40,690
protocol and we we had to put that on
the back burner for a while I'm hoping

337
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,249
to pick that back up soon

338
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:49,059
I would love some help if any of you are
interested in hacking packets smb2 is a

339
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:52,928
ridiculous protocol ridiculous than smb1
though

340
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:58,480
yes considerably less ridiculous smb1 is
mind-blowing

341
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,840
it's completely insane smb2 is just
weird

342
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:09,668
it's yeah it's better but yeah so yeah
working forward on on new protocol

343
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:17,950
support is a big thing integrations with
other other tools to i think it's going

344
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,989
to be a major focus we've talked about
it a lot for years but i think this year

345
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:27,369
in particular it's going to be a big
thing like our show Empire was mentioned

346
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:31,389
uh but I mean we've always had our
integrations with nmap and john the

347
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:34,809
ripper for example but like we're going
to be working on making those probably

348
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:40,210
better and looking at other tools like
ah Brandon pirri over here wrote a

349
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,019
plug-in at 1.4 sequel map integration
I'd like to see that

350
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,399
yeah oh yeah uh I'd like to see that

351
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,059
like do I get improved and get some love
and be made more of a first class thing

352
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:58,239
are as Brent said like the this idea
that we have to build everything

353
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:02,169
ourselves just isn't feasible for the
amount of time and resources that we

354
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:05,760
have and I'd really like I really like
to see our

355
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,040
community of various people make info
second hacking tools work together more

356
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,540
tightly and closely so that's one of the
big things I I hope for over the next

357
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,889
year i think as far as a community i
think i've seen metasploit take shifts

358
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:25,740
as well I i see some really amazing new
contributors that have served taken over

359
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,090
so I can almost like a new generation of
Medicine hackers and I know mentally

360
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,060
sort of had some chips we had like all
these guys that were really active five

361
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,540
years ago and these days they're not as
active and something that makes really

362
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,780
excited as we are having a whole new
generation of people there just

363
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,620
discovering metasploit for the first
time riding the first modules and what

364
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,219
we basically I think it's really cool is
that we're kind of incubating a whole

365
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,150
new set of people who are kind of
shaping this point in a different way

366
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,530
and maybe was would have been built like
45 years ago 14 years ago or something

367
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,149
like that so as is move forward i think
what most exciting things for me about

368
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,510
medicine boy is just welcoming all the
new community members all new people who

369
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:10,020
have contributed this year just it is
that blows my mind all the new guys will

370
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,610
talk a little bit a Egypt's new shiny
talk as well but up

371
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:18,659
yeah i think that's that's proven to
think that gets me going about minus 1

372
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,980
and wheels

373
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:35,460
I and so the question was about
integration with with expose uh which is

374
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,950
rapid7 vulnerability scanner so I
Metasploit framework uh and of itself

375
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:47,250
can import data from all pretty much
everyone Stanner I know about from a

376
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:51,660
trip from a network one scanner
standpoint we do have integrations with

377
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:57,690
my exposé are specifically of course
because it's our in-house product and

378
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,560
some of that is built into our
commercial offerings to be a little more

379
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,899
in depth but uh from the open-source
standpoint we want you to be able to

380
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,250
polling data and the rapid seven
marketing people are probably gonna hate

381
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,290
me for saying this but from from any
other product whether it's another

382
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,658
company's commercial product or our

383
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:23,879
uh I I don't feel like it's appropriate
for our open the open-source part of

384
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:31,199
Medicine boy to favor next pose over
anything else like whatever tools you

385
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,519
need to get your job done that's what we
should strive to integrate with you know

386
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,249
we we've actually a we invested doesn't
work this year to integrate with the

387
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:44,369
actual official next pose client gym as
well so that's going to actually improve

388
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:48,720
our import performance considerably once
we get that I'm pushed in something else

389
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,759
is we've actually been getting updates
from Nessus and from open bars and then

390
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,970
the guys who work on those projects may
have been upping their integration stuff

391
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,190
as well so it's it's pretty exciting

392
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:06,989
I see everything just become tighter in
future but it would be if it weren't

393
00:34:06,989 --> 00:34:11,970
impossible it would also be suicidal for
display to like favorite and expose over

394
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,439
anything else right

395
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,629
we absolutely should be doing that and
BN work well with the Expos could we

396
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:24,239
like those guys in there like right over
there you know conceptually but it it's

397
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,459
metasploit is like a lot of places talk
about how their they support open source

398
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,220
and they have this open source project
and you'll see a lot of open source

399
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:39,509
projects out there that have 124
contributors you know metasploit is

400
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:45,179
unique in that we do have hundreds we
have we have at least 200 don't work at

401
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:51,418
rapid7 and never have and so that's if
there would be a revolt you know like i

402
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:55,288
know energetic ran his own porcupine
displayed for two or three years because

403
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:59,490
he hit the way we loaded everything and
then we fix it and now I don't think he

404
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:04,979
supports it anymore so that's good and
it so so yeah like if you have like a

405
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,510
vulnerability scanner you like or like
you know web application skinny like or

406
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,559
something else something a little more
active like a firewall manager system or

407
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,079
like web application firewall something
like that that you want to work on

408
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,240
display with I I know that I know that
first off you know we can't stop you

409
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,899
from from doing that integration work
and secondly we will help you do it

410
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,220
because rapid7 is very serious about our
commitment to open source we make cool

411
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,399
t-shirts and

412
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,210
and hire people from the open source
community and all that

413
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:40,000
yeah yeah yeah so likewise oh yeah i
mean we're really we're really into that

414
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,400
and and it's it's a really unique
project to be involved in not just

415
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,270
because it's so friendly and we all hold
hands and sing Kumbaya when we are

416
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:55,240
popping boxes but because it's it is so
active externally it's not just like

417
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,770
coding with the windows open

418
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:02,349
it's weird we are we we do collaborate
so yet so I mean what you see a lot of

419
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:07,180
times with the commercial open source
companies like that have an open-source

420
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,058
offering and then their commercial
offering on top of it which is sort of

421
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:14,619
the model that metasploit it's had 44
the past however many years since the

422
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:21,520
acquisition seven years ago on a lot of
times that of those companies will say

423
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,880
oh yeah we have this open source thing
but they don't really support it that

424
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,660
much and they don't really care about it
they just use it as a driver to drive

425
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:34,690
people to the commercial offering i have
many times had conversations with people

426
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:39,490
at the very top of our products
organization at rapid7 who I i basically

427
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,479
say what do you see as the role of
Medicine boy framework of our open

428
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,460
source ID and what they always what they
all inevitably say is that it drives

429
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,000
everything we do in medicine late that
the framework and the open source

430
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,950
community is the most important thing
and that they are dedicated to

431
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:03,220
protecting and and cherishing that part
of what we do so it's a very unique

432
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:09,490
environment I think I at rapid7 in terms
of how we support that and if it didn't

433
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,078
think that way I wouldn't still be here

434
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:19,480
yeah truth to answer your question Jeff
Darmok

435
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:34,279
yeah yes with so the question was about
a medicine . module that attacks

436
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,610
metasploit but I am afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to be a little more

437
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,860
specific because there was more than one

438
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:55,850
yeah yeah just recently so detailed
update matters blood place a little bit

439
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,509
of both

440
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:03,110
both so yeah we are we are both like oh
shit like we screwed something up and oh

441
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,830
cool

442
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,950
hey this will be funny we're gonna have
a Metasploit module that will attack

443
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:13,310
metasploit and we've had those who 442
there's I little group forcers there's a

444
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:20,299
destroyed our pc brute forces that
somebody wrote a script rocky road a

445
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:26,300
whole bunch of directory traversals from
a malicious meterpreter server that was

446
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:31,790
awesome where if I if medically
connected to a malicious meterpreter

447
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:37,250
session it could do past reversals and
drop files in your like dinosaur

448
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:44,120
directory so it was code execution from
members of council Darcy and I love that

449
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,690
stuff

450
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,970
I think it's hilarious I think we'd be
Jane hypocrites if we didn't embrace

451
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:53,959
that I think right like part of a big
part of what we do is the idea of

452
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,880
sharing the information about these
vulnerabilities and exploits to make

453
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,330
security better for everyone and
increase awareness and allow people to

454
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,930
test so if we didn't do that for our own
products we could just be a bunch of

455
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,359
hypocrites replace the shit's funny

456
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:15,050
yes i will note that we are we actually
went from disclosure to us to fixes and

457
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:19,400
release within less than a week so we we
don't hold on to things and there's

458
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,340
really no point to it and then we should
have taken the 60 days

459
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,340
what's that you taking the 60 days oh I
know I know

460
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,210
yeah we worry about that users to you
know that kind of how you want the

461
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,380
person to find it was deflected right i
mean not necessarily get it

462
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:52,020
so as a as a handler of some recent
medical it bugs like I feel their pain

463
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:58,320
you know we do get bugs have
occasionally and we report bugs a lot

464
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,650
more often in other people's stuff and
so the question was like how's our

465
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:07,140
relationship with vendors we publish
exploits it's good it's it's better than

466
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,629
it has been ever you know we haven't had
really anything in the way of like any

467
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,380
any sort of chilling effects on our on
kind of their normal day-to-day on

468
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,990
disclosure you know despite the fact
that we have a great like we do have a

469
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,890
company behind us rapid7 and rapid 7 has
a growing customer base and we're

470
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,240
running into more and more often
customers that we didn't the researcher

471
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,240
didn't know that they were Rapids have a
customer could be like an external

472
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,470
person who doesn't work at rapid7 we
have researchers inside rapid7 who don't

473
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:43,140
like have magical access to our entire
customer and prospect lists and so when

474
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,629
those things come up we we do take a
pretty hard editorial style line on that

475
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:54,960
where we don't hold back just because
someone is a customer rapid7 you know we

476
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,740
it's helpful on disclosure because we
know who to call because they pay us

477
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,509
money and so we could just like talk to
their account manager and say like a we

478
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,600
can we have a bug on your stuff sorry I
we're going to publish them his way

479
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:12,720
module would you like to continue giving
us money then so that conversation is a

480
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,129
little bit it it's usually like our own
sales people who freak out over that

481
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,920
kind of thing because it's their
paycheck all but four vendors in general

482
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,560
I'd say that we have we do enjoy a
pretty decent relationship by and large

483
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,390
like I you know I handle all of the
outbound vulnerability disclosure stuff

484
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:40,650
so my job is to you know approach people
and say like hey I'm really sorry to be

485
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,890
the one to tell you this but you have
about right and so we try to be friendly

486
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,879
about we try to front with the kinds of
timelines that we expect

487
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,940
the people so they at least have a
mission

488
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,829
interestingly enough Brandon pirri no
one gave us any kind of sort of

489
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:59,849
timelines or notions on on when they
were going to publish their own world

490
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:07,410
published vulnerabilities or anything
like that when they reported a bug

491
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:17,609
yeah it's very helpful when you report
bugs to other people to be very explicit

492
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:22,828
on what you plan to do afterwards and
it's harder to be explicit when you're

493
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:27,990
in a bar i guess i'm not writing things
down but I thank you very much that was

494
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,819
a good fit fine

495
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:37,410
yeah so yeah so we try to make sure that
like the people that we work we actually

496
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,990
are working with them we're not just
shaming then we're not just saying like

497
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:44,399
I your software is dumb and you should
feel bad about it you know we try to

498
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,150
make sure that not only are reporting
vulnerabilities we get sweet tasty

499
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,509
Metasploit module is out of them but
like fixes are reasonable and mitigation

500
00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:55,890
is reasonable and they're not and then
the men and the mitigations actually

501
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:01,049
work and they're not just like caught on
the back foot when when we release

502
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:03,390
management modules they have some kind
of notion of how they're going to

503
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,109
respond to it and generally it's been ok
I still occasionally get like nasty

504
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:13,288
grams from done like attorney letterhead
but it's not that nothing has really

505
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:16,769
come up i guess in about I don't know
eight or nine months

506
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:23,970
lately we have time we we are so I this
one by really fast
