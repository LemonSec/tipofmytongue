1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
little side

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:17,820
hey I'm fuzzy not thank you i'm here to
present embrace the boogeyman tactical

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,859
fear-mongering for those who penetrate
now we may be asking ourselves what's a

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,779
boogeyman so i googled it and I found
this definition here and I actually like

5
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,059
the second one a bit more and it says a
person or thing that is widely regarded

6
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,129
as an object of fear now keep this
definition in mind as we go through and

7
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:46,050
we talk about things so why am i giving
this talk really i care about this a lot

8
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,940
and I've seen this a lot and I've seen a
lot of things in the industry and I I i

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,539
wanted to express what it's like to to
be that person who has this internal red

10
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,710
team job where your boss basically it
says cause an impact move the neil and

11
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,880
I've if you've seen my talks before I
talked about things and I talked about

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,780
techniques and stuff we've used on the
job and I never really talked about what

13
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,860
happens

14
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,250
so this brings me to how and this is
just like a rhetorical slide like I was

15
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:27,299
going to say well how about we get all
along with the rest of the talk talking

16
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,600
bad so if you see when i talk before I
may have mentioned this Black Swan

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,130
theory and lacks one theory it's this
idea this is the scene Nicholas Taleb

18
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,470
came a piece of behavioral economists
and he basically says that Black Swan

19
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,880
theory or theory the Black Swan it's
it's an event metaphor her events that

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,670
describe something that happens comes as
a surprise has a huge and major effect

21
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,140
and then it's often inappropriately
rationalized after-the-fact with the

22
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,040
benefit of hindsight so essentially what
you're saying is that something happens

23
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,079
and it's big and then everyone because
this thing just happened thinks it's way

24
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,220
more likely to happen and they base
their decisions around and this quite

25
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,790
doesn't

26
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,780
doesn't quite capture that but the other
part of that is that it changes your

27
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,079
behavior and the way you make decisions
going forward from there and because

28
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:27,180
these big things happen you then go
through your life and make decisions and

29
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,560
you do it differently you even
subconsciously something happened

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,730
because it happened so it's more likely
right than the big super easy you know

31
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,138
decade-old examples the 911 right you
have some of the day before

32
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,950
hey how likely is this to happen like
America's never happen it happens no one

33
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,119
wants to fly like weird like the
likelihood of it happening is probably

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,810
less now because it just happened but
everyone thinks that now more likely to

35
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:04,680
happen because it's in their mind so for
organizations and for companies that you

36
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,480
might work for whether your third party
or your internal they have fears and

37
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,238
they they have these events that they're
worried about and if you ask them what

38
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,419
what is the organization's greatest fear
they don't normally stay the next SL

39
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,579
downgrade attack with a fancy name they
don't say things like like heartbleed is

40
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,919
our greatest fear that is not the case
the real case I mean what with amateur

41
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,069
security organization least one that's
already been thinking about things and

42
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,429
they have a lot of valuable things to
protect they normally say the unknown

43
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,409
unknowns right they know they know stuff
and they know that they don't know many

44
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,459
things and they're working on fixing
those things that they don't know but

45
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,720
everyone knows that there's something
out there is going blind side you and I

46
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,060
think that blindside you that it's like
this is that you cannot scratch and that

47
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,239
is the organization's greatest fear most
of the time and they're they're always

48
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,060
like and something is going to get us
we're not going to see it we're going to

49
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,530
be embarrassed

50
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,909
we're going to be publicly shamed and
it's going to be the end of us so that

51
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:10,769
bitch that can't be scratched

52
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:15,060
I find myself in them in the middle of
it I find myself opinion it's cool to

53
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,149
scratch that

54
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,690
and that the pun fully inclined are
probably out there thinking or do you

55
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,740
mean up region as a service and no i
don't mean ass

56
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:30,370
I mean I think something different I
mean red team me because red teaming

57
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,240
even though it's not a perfect concept
it's not something that comes in and

58
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,440
finds everything it's more of a
depth-first rather than a breadth-first

59
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,910
type of attack

60
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,680
it's something that sort of lets you
feel like you've discovered one of those

61
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:52,720
unknown unknowns it allows you to
blindside yourself and because of this

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,370
you come in you pack everything you
create this Black Swan cataclysmic event

63
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:06,820
for an organization and you lay it down
like Max and everyone's like oh my god

64
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,770
just happened and suddenly the pen test
you just did just proved the possibility

65
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,919
right because there's probably some
executives walking around saying things

66
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:21,400
like X could never happen to us really a
ex just happened to you

67
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,469
how do you feel about that and now that
possibility is real that possibility

68
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,030
will push priority in a pretty amazing
way suddenly these executives who are

69
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,750
like well thank God that that terrible
cataclysmic event wasn't real

70
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,530
we better prioritize these things
because much like the Black Swan event

71
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,239
they're way more likely to happen in
reality they're just as likely to happen

72
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,380
as they were the day before but now that
it feels like it just happened they

73
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,250
think it's way more likely and they they
prioritize things and they prioritize

74
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,689
yeah

75
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:28,209
this is so hot it's good haha

76
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:45,939
good i'd much rather party then give a
talk right now so

77
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:55,990
oh so back-to-back two little D here
that's it's great that the new

78
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,060
possibility of something happening and
the new and improved priority and

79
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,569
thought that it's likely to happen will
actually get things done

80
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,639
people will be very concerned about
breaking the kill chain that you just

81
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:21,909
laid out in front of them.more t awful
dirty cotton with his good traditions

82
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:28,060
very good and getting things done is
good right

83
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:32,080
fixing a kill chain that definitely
existed before that you couldn't get

84
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,219
anyone to pay attention to how they pay
attention to it and they break some of

85
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:40,719
those chinks in that it's good right
suddenly the attack surface is harder

86
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:44,800
the company you're trying to provide a
service to our trying to protect from

87
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,180
the inside is now has one less way to
attempt to rock them to ruin them so i

88
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,659
say embrace the boogeyman pentest like
it's real embrace the fear use it to get

89
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:04,509
things done we can use the fear of pen
test and you know the way the media is

90
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:11,289
currently portray us as these God like
super cyber Slayers that everyone's

91
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:15,729
afraid of you know we're in the news and
it's not like we're underground anymore

92
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:20,080
right and companies recognize this and
you can use that political capital to

93
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,198
actually get things done and not just
you know ghosts on hacking and stuff so

94
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,380
this is an example of something that
really happened right red team exist

95
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,448
within the company we do these events
and one day I'm not on the floor not on

96
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:42,549
the floor work on walking around I see
this thing and this is on a wall

97
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:46,870
this is a picture that's printed out and
paste it on a wall and into this picture

98
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,610
is someone who left their

99
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,779
computer unlocked you know we know how
that goes right it's sometimes

100
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,800
everyone's got the game they play with
other people in the security industry if

101
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,729
you leave your computer on lock they
like get and they you know commit you to

102
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:07,720
sex acts of felonies are bringing in
donuts or something like that but this

103
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,529
happened organically outside of the
security organization somewhere else and

104
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:15,189
they have this like sticky note on
someone's computer and it says lock your

105
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:22,329
computer the red team will get you trust
no one just feel like a defect trust and

106
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,239
this was not the only picture on this
wall they were like building their own

107
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,720
wall of shame to to try and like protect
themselves from the red team and not

108
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,399
really you'd sort of like it if everyone
out there was like worried about real

109
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,170
attackers and worried about the you know
the real unknown unknown but the fact

110
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,579
that you label the unknown unknown and
someone can come get them and they have

111
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:50,140
the political freedom to do so suddenly
people are afraid and behaviors might

112
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,160
change from this so it was you know
where my heart but what if you're

113
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,560
boogeyman is 404 there's probably a lot
of cases where you're at a company or

114
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,699
you're working for a company and and
this you can't do something like this

115
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:09,490
and i wish i had a really good like that
come to the dark side we can do this

116
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:16,329
together we can create boogie men
everywhere and we have cookies dark

117
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:21,160
chocolate all those hear that seriously
i drew all these on an iPad and i'm

118
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,490
pretty pretty proud of this one

119
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:33,610
I'm anyways it is possible to build it
if you don't have it already you can

120
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,190
build the booking right there's a case
to make for this organizations need this

121
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,970
even if you're an external party right
you can say hey look i'm here to do a

122
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:47,529
pen test for you and you scoped it so
that you're not really getting any value

123
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:51,040
out of it like why are we doing this
maybe there's someone on the inside that

124
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,250
really believes in doing the right thing
and not just getting a pen test to check

125
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,980
some you know rubber-stamp boxes we have
a good friend of mine . called called

126
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,060
this pretend attrition testing don't
it's not do that

127
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:12,160
yeah so there's a couple things that are
really important if you need to be able

128
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,029
to build this you need these things to
really be able to create this kind of

129
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:20,890
internal fear catalyst that can push
needles when they need to and the first

130
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,420
is you need freedom of operation and
it's a hard sell it's not an easy thing

131
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,160
to get people to agree to and as an
internal red team i constantly fight a

132
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,750
battle to keep the freedom that we have
so when you build it build freedom into

133
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:42,490
it you don't allow yourself to be
burdened by frivolous scopes and things

134
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,450
like that

135
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,040
take the scope out of it say the scope
is that we will attack any systems any

136
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,050
humans anybody within the organization
to accurately simulate the threat

137
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,189
adversaries that you faced out in the
real world executives be like yeah

138
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,120
sounds like a good idea and maybe you'll
get that freedom and if you get it you

139
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,140
can hang onto it and you need the bill
because if you think about it the any

140
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,560
adversary that would want to target you
like think like thirteen-year-old kid in

141
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,859
his mom's basement is like you know it'd
be pretty cool to be able to print

142
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,730
myself some gift cards or be able to
download games for free

143
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,850
he's gonna be like he's not gonna need
to get approval on a phishing email he

144
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,440
sends he's going to be able to crank as
many out as he can he's going to be able

145
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,209
to come up with whatever idea he

146
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,559
and be able to target anybody in the
company so you should be able to operate

147
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:39,879
the same way if you want to accurately
simulate a pen test if you want to

148
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,910
accurately simulate what you might be
facing out more like you need the

149
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:50,860
freedom to do so then the second is
impact you need the ability to actually

150
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,170
shake things up right this isn't this
isn't a report that you lay on someone's

151
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,569
desk because if it's just that like they
have the the choice to read it or not

152
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:05,829
you need the ability to you need up for
her first you need a clear goal

153
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:10,329
you can't you can't cause an impact by
like going and dumping Active Directory

154
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:16,388
like what so what does that mean nothing
just like we took active directory did

155
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:18,910
you crack the passwords did you use them

156
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,879
what did it get you were you able to
actually cause damage to the company

157
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:29,259
like you don't see in the news like
lizard squad dumps Active Directory know

158
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:33,850
you see so-and-so compromises X number
of credit cards X number of user

159
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,860
accounts such-and-such twitter page is
now treating you know security taytay

160
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,879
instead of what it used to be tweeting
things things have to change people have

161
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:48,519
to see it and you need to know what
you're going after it clear target and

162
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,179
you you have to have something in mind
that you're trying to achieve its not

163
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:55,449
just packing for hacking sake it has to
have a goal

164
00:13:55,449 --> 00:14:00,429
it has to have a purpose you have to say
I am trying to get this part of the

165
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:04,629
organization to move to shift i'm trying
to move this needle from here to here

166
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:09,879
and i'm going to make sure that in my
attack i hit the right numbers hit the

167
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,559
right notes to actually move that needle
in a direction i'll tell you some real

168
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,699
stuff about that later

169
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:22,748
dirty and then the last one is maturity
and I mean I don't mean being like a

170
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,999
mature person because like look at me

171
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:29,769
obviously not I don't mean that I mean
operational maturity a lot of times it's

172
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:34,119
like red teaming is all about who has
the latest hacks who has the old days

173
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:37,869
it's not about the old days it's about
being able to operate efficiently

174
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:42,279
because you're never going to know
everything you're never going to have

175
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,769
every piece of the

176
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:46,470
so that you might encounter there's
always gonna be new technology coming

177
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,949
out

178
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:51,689
it is not about how late you are it's
about how quickly you can mobilize

179
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:56,579
operate and and do the things you need
to do an environment you need to be able

180
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:01,349
to have as little friction as possible
in spinning up conquering something new

181
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,929
and not having to like what you think
reporting reporting is normally a

182
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:12,689
terrible burden automated away make
reporting as easy as possible make

183
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:17,849
spitting up c2 as easy as possible make
writing new malware as easy as possible

184
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,079
that way you can focus on the things
that you don't understand when you bump

185
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,469
up against them it's not just about
playing the same old tricks it's about

186
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,529
bumping up against something new and
being able to grab it and tackle it and

187
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,889
say okay we don't worry about all this
little bullshit

188
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,610
instead we can focus on figuring out how
this thing works and figuring out how we

189
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,119
can use it to actually achieve something
and achieve our goal and positive impact

190
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:49,470
so all that was a lot of fluff and that
fucking Isis like ripping my insides

191
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:58,470
guys I've talked about owning people
personally before we talked about this

192
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,059
if you haven't seen it it's basically
the idea of super targeted daxing and

193
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:08,368
building . stays on people and super
targeted spearfishing and then super low

194
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:13,499
effort high-impact post exploitation
stuff and there was a class cool it's

195
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:17,850
neat cool tricks but I never really got
to talk about because it hasn't happened

196
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,589
yet is what is the impact when you do
that to an organization over and over

197
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:28,139
lot of things that happen when you are a
team that operates and you get on

198
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,490
people's systems and you steal their
password and you read their email and

199
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,819
use their account all over the place and
you trick them into bypassing there to

200
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:40,110
fa there's there's a lot of things that
happen and the first thing is

201
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,329
immediately there is a instinct fear of
being a target that develop something

202
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:51,508
people people don't want to be the next
person in the red team slides when we

203
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,720
talk about what we did and this this

204
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,900
ripples out and people are so afraid
that things will happen and nobody i

205
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,780
know you get in the elevator like not
going to my floor are you what I won't

206
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,619
work here like what what do you what do
you mean he's like no i don't i don't

207
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:16,198
get hacked by the red team like wow
that's a pretty awkward elevator ride to

208
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:23,550
get them to work ok they're so afraid
actually that I'll Creek West access for

209
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,198
something to do my job right now i have
normal parts of my job that isn't just

210
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,520
like you know started hacking all-time
right i have parts of my job and I need

211
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,260
access to this thing so that I can you
know give feedback to it right now I can

212
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,490
contribute a good company . know your
red team we don't share that information

213
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,490
with you gonna use it against us

214
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:51,030
okay fair enough i guess but and I i
actually when I first interviewed for

215
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,470
this job they had someone ask me during
the interview process like how do you

216
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,500
deal with knowledge taint knowledge and
yeah like you're supposed to be a red

217
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,330
team hacking this company but you work
here you know things that you know you

218
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:12,510
shouldn't know like well you want me to
be better than everyone else right how

219
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,420
are we going to do that I think
knowledge is good i should know things

220
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,820
that the real adversary doesn't and then
the wave that we make that pristine so

221
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,120
that people aren't like you guys cheated
is that you build the kill chain out

222
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,860
fully every time even if you know where
the jewels are you don't go for him

223
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,020
you find out where you would find out
that they are and then you go you say

224
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,450
anything and when you present your
findings

225
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,370
it's ok we got this guy's account
through a public dump logged in as him

226
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,669
we went straight for the information box
like repository went for their

227
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:49,260
confluence or something we read
everything we found passwords here we

228
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,879
found that you said all your important
stuff is in this database here and

229
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,230
here's here's the proof that we found it
there and then we went after it and when

230
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,120
you build that whole thing out for
people

231
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,139
there's nothing they can say so that's
probably important as an external tester

232
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,230
and it's definitely really important if
you're an intern already that's the one

233
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,820
thing that has kept us

234
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,309
being discredited as cheaters
essentially and they're also so afraid

235
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:20,639
that it's not just you it's its people
you work with or they associate you with

236
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:23,639
their like you're going to sell secrets
the red team we're not going to give you

237
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:31,500
root on these boxes or not we don't
we'll do the head with no the distrust

238
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,620
is real and it's it's kind of
counterproductive

239
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:42,210
I hope that it's worth it and in the end
you realize it so our people are so

240
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:48,029
afraid of you and there's this is air of
fear and that's the moment that you

241
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:52,769
realize that you just became the
boogeyman you didn't think going into it

242
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,490
that you would be but at a certain point
like damn what people see me as an

243
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:03,600
object of fear and this has this has
reaching effects for you right it's it's

244
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,879
something that you see people use you as
a tool as an object they use you to get

245
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:13,080
political capital they use it to get
things done for good sometimes usually

246
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,029
sometimes they use it but I like could
the red team say that it's cool

247
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:25,230
oh we don't sign off on things were not
security review for the boogeymen but

248
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:32,070
they want some kind of stamp ins now one
of the super obvious things that happen

249
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:38,519
is that there's an immune response
because you are damaging an organization

250
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,120
you're going and you're causing trouble
you're causing chaos you're basically

251
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,229
making them very ill and they feel very
ill in the middle of a red team exercise

252
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,990
typically and this is good this is a
good part of it you want that you you

253
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,299
want it so that the immune system kicks
in

254
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,889
do you fight you off and they become
better for it and they they they love a

255
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:04,979
lot right because the idea that you
would come back the next year and they

256
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,779
would be susceptible to the same illness
to the same thing that got them before

257
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:15,750
that is failure and I believe this like
really passionately really strong if

258
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,230
you're if you're one of those people out
there i'm sorry in advance

259
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:28,000
who has bragged and boasted like yeah we
got in like old hacks easy stuff we came

260
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,900
back next year we did the same thing
they suck haha you failed you

261
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,900
what was the purpose of the penetration
test

262
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,970
I mean maybe it wasn't your fault but
that's failure as an industry that's

263
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,140
failure for us if we've come in and
we've hacked something and we're like

264
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,890
look you got hacked and we came back the
next year and the same thing happened

265
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,720
what was the point in doing it in the
first place we accomplish nothing so it

266
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,260
we have to focus on that and we have to
make sure that the people were giving

267
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:05,320
things to focus on that it's hard now
the not-so-obvious thing is that there's

268
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,399
a fear immune response and this is
probably only an internal red team thing

269
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,610
here but there's suddenly the red team
was scary at a certain point but then

270
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:21,760
after a bid people adjust to get used to
the fact that there's this thing and

271
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:30,640
suddenly people like shit react and I
get an email says is you guys and it's

272
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,750
not because they are like yeah we found
you but it's because they want to

273
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:43,420
breathe that sigh of relief like oh just
the red team and god now that's a kind

274
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,290
of good i guess that they're there
they're all about it and they're looking

275
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,340
at things but it's it's also kind of bad
because it's hard to cause an impact

276
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,679
when if they figure out that it's the
red team they aren't on high alert

277
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,700
anymore you want all hands on deck you
want them to think it's real

278
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:08,080
so as a red team yeah we write tooling
and our tooling now is attributable to

279
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,090
us and we're trapped like a real threat
actor because I mean we are we cause

280
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:18,070
pain to the organization we caused chaos
because incidents and we are treated

281
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:22,330
like a real adversary and you know you
get in the elevator and you get it in

282
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,840
from an organizational perspective
there's a metric on us from our blue

283
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,620
team

284
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,799
I'm like we're tracking these threat
groups and we're listed there

285
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:35,289
it's like these guys from Romania these
guys turkey red team like we're right

286
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,730
alongside them there's no delineation
between us and the bad guys we are the

287
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,950
bad guys but that fear immune responses
like we're one that's okay because they

288
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:51,369
know that we aren't going to docs them
on Twitter or pay spin that so what do

289
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:59,379
you do maybe talk some on Twitter pieces
and this road isn't perfect it's not

290
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:08,529
without mistakes and so this is a
little-little Goudy and he has a goatee

291
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:13,119
whoo-hoo here

292
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,830
raise your hand if you're like stunts
hacking done that anyone do something

293
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:24,129
fun hacking and hacking never like to
put a little happy like BAM like little

294
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:28,629
book one-liner bash script and it does
something like larious like yeah it was

295
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:33,009
like that's hilarious you know like the
hotel lobby computer type of thing that

296
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:39,429
yeah i know i didn't see a lot of hands
but i know you have done that ok so so

297
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:44,320
it's a little bit of a pitfall when
you're an internal red team because so

298
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,539
so here's what we did we had this
problem you know you've seen it in the

299
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:50,080
earlier side people just they don't want
their computers they don't care and it's

300
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,830
hard you know anyone can walk up to a
system that's got access to everything

301
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,879
and just sit down booty to do you know
it takes two seconds to curl something

302
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:01,090
into bash and have a shell on that
system is persistent

303
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:08,289
so like all right fine and this was a
really heated thing because they put

304
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:15,519
this group right next to our team on the
floor there like 10 feet away and they

305
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:20,259
were like the worst this they really and
we should confront them about this and

306
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:24,220
say like guys like lock your computer
come on like we've got guys over here

307
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:31,659
and they will take advantage of you and
they're like no lie like well fine we'll

308
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:37,690
show them so for about a week we just at
any time we see on my computer

309
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:43,450
drop it like an ssh key that we can use
later and then collect maybe 20 or 30

310
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:52,899
systems on friday we do this script so
what does smh is in connects it makes

311
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:57,369
their computers are you gonna leave your
computer unlocked again and it makes

312
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:01,899
their volume maximum and it opens up a
couple youtube links one of them is

313
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:03,729
Joseph screaming like humans

314
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:10,119
the other one is NCIS we've been hacked
right so you hear the guys like two

315
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:15,699
people typing on the keyboard like we've
been hacked up way to go to screaming

316
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,720
people are getting hacked

317
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,320
it's chaos and the other one is probably
some kind of dance track or something I

318
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,129
remember and then it just it just loops
and it just does this indefinitely and

319
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:27,549
it doesn't even wait that long so it's
popping up like a hundred chrome tabs

320
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:32,200
with this and it's just it doesn't stop
there is no end to it just people's

321
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,519
computers are crashing so like well it's
time it's friday at five o'clock click

322
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:42,100
and then you're just sitting there and
then across from your the and we think

323
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,369
it's hilarious

324
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:49,928
not everyone thought it was so hilarious
now repeat its Fridays have a clock tree

325
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:56,200
save time except boss's boss roles in
like whatever you're doing and stop it

326
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,309
right now right yeah okay okay but like
this is a loop i mean it's still

327
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:05,799
happening really stop it

328
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:14,860
and it turns out that like some senior
director is giving a presentation and

329
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:23,830
his computer is going apeshit goat shit
I mean with chaos and it's super

330
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:28,389
embarrassing for him and it's super it's
bad right this is it its stun hacking

331
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:33,248
and it's a it's a prank right we put a
prank because of a crime of opportunity

332
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:39,399
now this didn't have the effect we
wanted people didn't start locking their

333
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:46,600
computers suddenly what happens this
team doesn't sit there anymore but they

334
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,779
probably still don't lock their
computers just somewhere further away

335
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:54,100
from us and it's because we pulled a
prank and there's a difference between a

336
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:01,330
prank and propaganda propaganda is
calculated it has a goal you can't just

337
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,678
stunt hack and expect people and laugh
about it and expect people to change the

338
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,820
behavior in the way you want just
because you get it doesn't mean that

339
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,928
they're going to get you have to really
think this is social engineering at

340
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:18,309
scale you have to think about what's
gonna happen when we hack stuff and

341
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:29,619
people find out about it i was about to
get ice to get everything there's a

342
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:34,539
difference between prank and propaganda
so let's be real me tell you i I've

343
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:39,100
talked hypothetically a lot that was
kind of one example this is probably

344
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,480
where I get in trouble

345
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,149
ok so imagine that you work in a large
company and like any large company you

346
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:53,649
know that there's probably one group out
there who's just the worst they they're

347
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:57,939
like yeah we care about security but
then they just do everything wrong and

348
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,869
they care about you know speed and scale
way more than they care about security

349
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:05,559
and normally is from my experience I've
seen a lot of I've seen a lot of insides

350
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:09,489
of companies its most frequently like a
DevOps group or something like that

351
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:13,779
these guys are like we gotta build stuff
now like yes but you should build it

352
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:16,809
security don't know what to do that
later we gotta build stuff now and these

353
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:18,330
guys got access to

354
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,918
everything right thing SSH keys that
just let them move anywhere they do

355
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,090
things like make little back doors for
themselves so they can just jump into

356
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,379
prod and then I mean you can't be
bothered to fa like that's slow them

357
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:39,990
down gotta deliver right so imagine just
hypothetically that there's a group like

358
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:48,960
this out there so we have these problems
we've talked about right one is like if

359
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,789
the red team's attributed people don't
really get so scared anymore so we

360
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:01,169
decided that we're gonna we're gonna
pull a clever ruse we are going to

361
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:06,480
really just owned everything we are
going to abuse because its propaganda

362
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,429
deep the problem area where it's like we
know these guys are doing some stuff

363
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:14,820
we're going to use their back doors
gonna jump in the problem make sure we

364
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,740
use certain people's accounts we are
going to really target the right people

365
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,320
that we know are our part of the problem
right because we want them to hear us we

366
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,070
want them to listen it's not just a
random prank it's something that we want

367
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,059
certain people to be on board with us
and we want them to understand the

368
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:39,899
impact so as part of our ruse like well
it'd probably be pretty cool got hacked

369
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:45,330
Russia so let's just retool everything
alright new malware we're not going to

370
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,539
make it look at that stuff that we've
done before and we're going to put

371
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:52,740
Russians character strings in our
binaries we're going to do things like

372
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,960
compiled on our Russian windows system
and we're going to try and look like

373
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,200
we're going to use all Russian eye peas
and maybe some china for good measure

374
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,950
and i'll be like that's the Russians and
we're going to do everything we can

375
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,429
we're going to really try and simulate
something that's not us which is by the

376
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:18,330
way a lot of extra work so at a certain
point I here's the TLDR we which we

377
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:25,710
slaughtered them like abysmal and we
took everything and we didn't exhaled

378
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,820
everything to be encrypted it don't
worry but we we took everything

379
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,610
this is

380
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:36,820
this is your front-page cataclysmic
event and we made it look like Russia as

381
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,320
much as possible and we're hoping we'd
sort of get caught in the act and I'd be

382
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,840
like a freak out and then we're like
maybe we could ran some the executives

383
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,260
we can like look at the data we have it
was a million Bitcoin and then just let

384
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,370
them like sweat it out and see what
happens and we i was in meetings for a

385
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,510
week trying to hey poop what can we do
this like no we have to build bridges

386
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,190
and things like that

387
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,730
we can't we can't do this to these
people they're going to blame all of

388
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,080
security

389
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:12,129
ok well what if we just what if we ramp
up our attack and ramp up the visibility

390
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,299
until we get caught and like well yeah
that sounds that sounds reasonable

391
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:23,169
so I interpreted that as the ability to
ssh to every system that we have access

392
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:31,179
to which I didn't say that it was every
system in prod but it again and i'm not

393
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:33,690
saying that it was

394
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:41,220
but maybe was and the wall command with
is probably good enough here

395
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:47,039
hypothetically and if you took that and
you just translated the hackers

396
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:55,259
manifesto into Russian and pop that in
there probably with a basement link just

397
00:32:55,259 --> 00:33:00,480
kind of ominous that has like a date at
the top of it and nothing else and then

398
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:08,639
he said scored off soon in Russian you
say like everything will be revealed its

399
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:11,549
kind of ominous but it's kind of true
too

400
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:15,870
we were going to reveal that it was just
a test is gonna update the link later

401
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:21,629
and say this is just a test and you know
but we wanted them to think that we were

402
00:33:21,629 --> 00:33:25,620
gonna dump everything and we want them
to know that we had access to everything

403
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:31,918
so I didn't know we could have done this
better right soapy spin will will take

404
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:39,330
down a link like for no reason like blue
team's like Shh it seems bad paceman

405
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:44,340
remove it tastes like a cleat like oh
that was my way to tell you that it was

406
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,610
a test

407
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:53,100
such things aren't going as planned any
more like well double down we'll use the

408
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,639
first guy we fished we're going to get
in to his like single sign-on we're

409
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,790
gonna use the internal messaging
platform and we're just going to start

410
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:05,460
posting these like Ukrainian threat
group pictures and just like like

411
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,830
threats basically from his account and
our blue team is just like deleting them

412
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,520
as fast as possible and we're just like
when posting them everywhere trying to

413
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,739
get as much visibility as possible and
so what happens up happening is that

414
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:25,168
like we'll get some stuff shut down like

consequences are unbearable i could glad

447
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,740
you guys like a good pun

448
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,689
normally it sounds more like oh I don't
think your battery action was awesome

449
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:21,049
and you know people were reused we
cloned badges to get into the building

450
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:25,369
because we cannot just wanted a quick
win and I mean you know sorry I class

451
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:31,729
for that but so we were like well we
need to do something about that so i

452
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:35,959
contacted vendor and I can you make us
bad shields that prevent people's badges

453
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:40,879
from being read and I can you also
custom printed graphic on them so we got

454
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,410
badge holders with this because you
don't put your company logo on on badge

455
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:52,670
holders you put you know this hope you
put your shape on it will you wear that

456
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,799
shame and you know that you're protected

457
00:37:54,799 --> 00:38:01,459
yeah so I don't know I didn't really get
to this slide but it was like this I can

458
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:06,678
I'm missing my speaker notes so it's not
going as fluid as it was it like and I'm

459
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:28,969
I'm full of hot bubbly ice at the moment
longer than I thought oh yeah so I i

460
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:35,989
stopped using the slides and started
talking so it sort of sounds like red

461
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:41,390
teaming penetrating and fear-mongering
is everything and it's not right you

462
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:45,799
could do this and you could have this
cataclysmic Fallout and without from

463
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:49,038
your organization you need the
executives to go play a game of thrones

464
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:53,959
for you you need you need project
managers to harass the people to fix the

465
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:57,469
list of things you gave them you need
all of this to work together and you

466
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:01,400
have to keep fighting for it's a battle
right you have to keep saying like this

467
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,719
is important we need to do this remember
remember DJ remember the apocalypse that

468
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:09,589
other day remember Bruce Willis on that
asteroid like it did matters we need to

469
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:13,578
keep working on it and you have to keep
trying right so it's it's it's it's not

470
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:17,299
really a one-and-done and it's hard but
you need support for everybody need to

471
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:22,219
get people to buy into this idea that
this stuff works and it is possible to

472
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:26,140
get things fixed and especially the easy
wins people will think

473
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:35,680
enable they will try some more like an
arrow wordsmith down that's amazing

474
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:41,769
