1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,620
the towel trick tree could watch them

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:32,699
yeah / traders everybody hear me ok well
holy crap that's long

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:41,640
alright sweet sweet i guess is everybody
we're gonna take this bright light the

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,660
fires to get tires

5
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,440
how you guys doing today sweet you're
about to see some skater beer

6
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,870
uh no this has ever been done before so
my caveat with the things could go badly

7
00:00:51,870 --> 00:01:02,578
haha i do that to see if you guys can
catch it

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,659
Shh yeah about this

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,840
yeah that works too I know kind of cable
and they're awesome

10
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:27,029
all right let's start the sucker sweet
thank you for coming out today are this

11
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,000
is a project my team is working on since
what februari of this year arm and I'm

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,400
gonna go real quick through what we do
it tell us because it may be named

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,970
you're not familiar with and then we're
gonna launch right into our cool project

14
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,060
this thing that we did it checks off a
lot of cool boxes that we done for

15
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,490
challenges for learning process control
networks cable networks through just

16
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,189
just having a good time drinking a lot
of beer

17
00:01:53,189 --> 00:02:00,059
kk testing and being alleged others and
being able to test like our own stuff

18
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,710
that we do so quick

19
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,520
who's tell us who we are what we are
where the threat intelligence arm cisco

20
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,780
so if you have sort of maybe your
security customer or using a sock or not

21
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,580
can you work with any that fun stuff
odds are using our intelligence on to

22
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,470
something bad guys doing that stuff uh
we drill down and detection response

23
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,150
group so basically what we do is we look
at the bad guys craft stores and

24
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:31,670
intelligence and we program that into or
are formally force Francisco IPS

25
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,380
next-gen firewall next-gen ideas stuff
of course my team is ask a team so we do

26
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,519
all industrial control system research
on with mr. Patrick's and sitting in

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,270
front of me right here

28
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,980
great and Patrick and mr. cross poncho
sitting over there and moonlighting for

29
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,579
us is Christmas me wherever he happens
to be in the back

30
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,310
hiding from everybody as usual so we
look at all kinds of cool stuff anything

31
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,350
to get anything ICS skate is a type of
ICS by the way but you name it we've

32
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,239
looked at it and of course we take all
the cool stuff roll into a cool friend

33
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,600
tell thing back in the product could
meet on the cycle repeats

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,620
alright that's enough of the talus stuff
was an adult industrial control system

35
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,480
network if you were to look at it you
you can look at things through the lens

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,260
of your experiences from information
technology right so you can probably all

37
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,410
top of your head name all the products
ago a night in a typical lighten our

38
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,480
firewalls routers switches workstation
servers Business Process Servers sap erp

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,540
just go down the list and you can find
all kinds of stuff

40
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,590
ICS networks not too dissimilar actually
it's about ninety-five percent overlap

41
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,250
that five percent is a wildly different
5% usually what we try to do this

42
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,630
project was to simulate that five
percent and I think we have pretty close

43
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,290
to the mark

44
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,739
all right on what you see here is called
the purdue model and I know it's very

45
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:54,200
difficult in the back i apologize i
stole this from from ics-cert oh it's

46
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,100
basically describes how you would see a
typical ICS network it was architected

47
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,049
in the ideal pie-in-the-sky way

48
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,140
alright so you have our external zone
where you have wireless connectivity

49
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,399
utilities very common that is a lot of
remote stuff corporate zone which is a

50
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,780
clear business HR IT normal stuff then
you would segment where manufacturing

51
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,720
zone and what's often called the cell
zone the zone is kind of where your

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,089
rubber meets the road for industrial
control systems

53
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:22,369
that's where you see a lot of your real
air quotes kita stuff right so then you

54
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,740
have what's called assist safety
instrumented zone that's a UH the if

55
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:34,940
pressure equals x on a refinery on the
gas system and it caused a loss apply

56
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,479
for human injury immediately vent so
that's kind of your craft things have

57
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,130
gone bad bone use a lot of the same
equipment honestly but very very very

58
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,789
serious and can never go Tori
implications behind as well so again

59
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,729
this is your typical ICS architecture
where it should be typical is

60
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:53,990
architecture all right before we go too
far if you want something the hackers

61
00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:00,500
are our scada system with and xeon they
are AP is on our system is totally

62
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,510
hackable alright happen in the sense
that you can connect wirelessly and if

63
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,219
you are a bad enough dude or dudette
pour yourself a beer from our kegerator

64
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,490
all right i want to give you see up
front because some of you are probably

65
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,940
throwing up in map right now wondering
how you can possibly do this we want you

66
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,760
to do this we brought here specifically
for you to do this so the SSID is

67
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,560
advanced persistent thirst

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,900
haha right yeah I know clever password
is free capital B beer free beer bang

69
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,159
and if you're going to in maps can if
you have any kind of modern updated map

70
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:38,030
you'll immediately see the 192 168 for
20 / 16 network

71
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,020
good luck have fun and anyways how did
this come to be great great question

72
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:48,080
one day I lost as to me Joe we need a
stunt hack instead hack is a very

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,950
careful thing to say because people's
done hack to draw attention to security

74
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,669
issues in the industry or sometimes
brand promotion it could be any number

75
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,599
of things still has a dangerous thing in
this particular case my boss said to me

76
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:03,380
we want to start act because Talas wants
to plant his flag let oh by the way we

77
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,310
do ICS as well and I said great idea
Boston goes well what should i do when

78
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,550
he goes well something ICS and I said
that's what I'm awfully wide area to go

79
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,530
through and I said aloud randomly well
what if we put a PLC on the side of a

80
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,880
kegerator and at that point I committed
myself something that had never been

81
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,229
done before because if there's two
things we do at Alice we hack and we

82
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:32,430
drink and this became basically the
ultimate project to combine

83
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,440
both of those mutual interest hacking
and fine libations for what we do so

84
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,210
it's a step back but the most glorious
kind of stone axe because you drink beer

85
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,289
from it as well

86
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:49,500
alright so basically we took
programmable logic controller married it

87
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,430
to our kegerator mini-fridge anyone to
go buy one on amazon right and uh then

88
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,020
through a typical process creation was
able to basically make a process around

89
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:07,260
the act of pouring a beer using all
industrial control equipment so here's a

90
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,510
good example of how something like that
would look if we were to draw it out for

91
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,200
you again it is a very soon the back to
apologize for that

92
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,880
alright uh and when we started down this
path we had no idea how we're gonna do

93
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,800
this because none of this has been done
before right I if anyone knows offhand

94
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,830
were an industrial control system
kegerator exist please come find me

95
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,020
after this I'm gonna shake the guy's
hand or this could look up on the

96
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,930
internet all the mightiest googling no
demand revealed exactly nothing so

97
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,050
basically we found herself in a unique
position of we need to make an

98
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,690
industrial control system that can pour
beer and we achieved it earlier march of

99
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,200
this year we basically took two
solenoids inserted in front of the beer

100
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,270
valves created a really sweet HMI here's
an example of that age of mine is

101
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,180
example of that age of mine sort of God
it exists

102
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,120
yeah there we go sweet and you can see
from here we had basically two solenoids

103
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,280
interrupting the beer lines and you have
to go push a button on our our panel

104
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,530
view 800 of human-machine interface it's
allen bradley cooper and it would open a

105
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,969
line here would come out through the
line as you poured the tap handle and we

106
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,180
went sweet we have skated beer and all
was well with the world

107
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,670
the problem was that it when you insert
a solenoid into a beer line it tends to

108
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,110
phone the beer and also it wasn't
pouring the beer for us and I think we

109
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,470
realized at that point we weren't going
to be happy if we could just happen we

110
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,510
have to reach our skinny week nerd hands
and pour beer ourselves we want the

111
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,110
almighty of power of industrial control
systems to do a forest

112
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,990
so we figured out we could pour beer it
was pretty sweet and we said you know

113
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,790
what we're gonna take us back to the
drawing board so we with a lot of

114
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,959
engineering by my senior guy Patrick
santis right here a lot of careful

115
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,450
engineering and again a lot of testing
of beer a lot of testing of taps and

116
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,340
figuring out how this is gonna work

117
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,630
we were able to ascertain what we wanted
to do but we made a purchase equipment

118
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,280
assemble it

119
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,860
what you see here or 268 outside leave
push solenoids inside of a tapped our be

120
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,950
3d printed this tattoo our does not
exist anywhere else

121
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,880
we're able to design it and autocad
here's a good mock-up of that we didn't

122
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,760
really know if this is gonna work so
we're like let's try it

123
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,650
so we have 2 16 ounce push Illinois to
connect to a ball joint that actuate

124
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:32,569
forward when the PLC tells them to
actuate for all right arm

125
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,010
the problem with that is how do you
reach pract a beer tap handle the only

126
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,600
typically goes in one direction

127
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,010
glory be they make self-retracting beer
tap handles highly recommend they save

128
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,700
their bacon

129
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,940
we had even cut the Springs from them
because they pushed back to hard that

130
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,590
solar couldn't push forward so that was
a problem but turns out

131
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,670
Talos and it's hacker haven that it is
has many diverse skills including one

132
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,880
gentleman who was a skilled autocad guy
I don't know why or how

133
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,140
all i know is i'm thankful that he
rehired and he works for us was able to

134
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,850
design for us at awesome tower and cad
except we can't make this out of metal

135
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,710
what do we do well turns out if someone
has a 16 x 10 x 10 x 16 total 3d printer

136
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,490
which by the way they're extremely
expensive good luck with that we

137
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,360
basically found a third party to print
our beer tap tower for something awesome

138
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,710
this is looking really great

139
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,520
so here's an example of what that looks
like in 3d rendering we actually did

140
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,020
three separate parts so we did a tapped
our a removable face plate which isn't

141
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,540
that removal and a tap tower or excuse
me based our a simple together bolted

142
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,380
together plexiglass windows on top of it
and of course we got a blinged-out put

143
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,470
lots of sweet lights on it right now it
looks like a simple

144
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,790
alright I'm flying I'm talking fast as I
want to give you guys an opportunity to

145
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,279
connect to it and try to pour yourself a
beer all right

146
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:56,819
so now the game alright this is not a
traditional CTF there are no hints there

147
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:01,079
are no slow softball to be logged at you
and then you crack it with a bat and you

148
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,519
move on to the next challenge is a
pass/fail thing we don't need no

149
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,800
stinking flags we do not do that

150
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,459
alright so you're gonna figure out where
you were not but you might be able to

151
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,268
bug us or bribe us to come give you some
hints as to how to pour this beer and I

152
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:20,189
assure you that it is completely totally
one hundred percent wirelessly capable

153
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,509
pour you a beer

154
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:24,569
uh if you can figure that part out

155
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:28,559
alright so we ever get to that in just a
minute

156
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,509
that's like to slide for now maybe slow
down bro at all right so remember the

157
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:36,509
ICS architecture thing we went over
right here's the part that we have

158
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:40,980
effectively simulated right this is
called a cell network again so network

159
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,939
typically exist in ICS architecture
where let the intelligent electronic

160
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:49,800
devices PLC's your hardon industrial
equipments it's like a factory floor

161
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,180
utility gets in any number of places
that you would see here's the problem

162
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,550
with ICS networks as i show you this
like this could be a soft drink bottling

163
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,959
factory but it probably not that utility
you're probably not an oil refinery and

164
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:08,339
that's really the problem is in general
I can hand anyone of you the exact same

165
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,569
equipment that we use in depending on
what vertical you belong to you

166
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:16,290
architecting completely different ways
and you know if an IT guy comes in he

167
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,420
probably knows how email works he
probably knows how active directory

168
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,689
works you probably know about the
s-works not necessarily the same with

169
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:26,250
ICS and that unique snowflake syndrome
is probably the reason that can be very

170
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,970
difficult to secure that stuff because
the process is sacrosanct and you can

171
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,449
interrupt that process and of course
security gets into that you know so we

172
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:36,809
want to get too complicated to that but
we actually want to talk about it later

173
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:39,809
we're here to talk about beer so let's
pour some beer real quick

174
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:47,128
yeah

175
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:58,359
Alice wirelessly control a suicide here
he's not using anything other than high

176
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,500
on to talk to the programmable logic
controller or that you ultimately you

177
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:15,130
good just working so much button one
that's right but he'll enjoy yourself

178
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:21,730
yeah yeah yeah i'll be in his water all
day

179
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:28,930
alright so before we go too far before
everyone starts the 113 at me I'm going

180
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,469
to issue this caveat beer is complicated

181
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,470
I never thought I'd be learning about
this as i did my job

182
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,970
kegs are tapped at a certain PSI alright
certain PSI works very delicately in

183
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,260
conjunction with our solenoids and our
beer taps to distribute beer an issue

184
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,250
based upon what's pushing and pulling
against the exact same time it does not

185
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,150
work perfectly all the time because of
chemistry and that's just the hard cold

186
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:00,490
reality of while we really tried to do
this and we got really really far but

187
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,839
some things you just can't control

188
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,660
alright so what's cool about this is you
saw it turn green when we pour the beer

189
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:15,100
right so that's designed to show you
what happens when locks up his grow up

190
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,950
turn red red

191
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,709
don't be that guy or girl alright
alright alright your turn red you know

192
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:28,449
we feel when we started on this path we
had no idea what was gonna take over our

193
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,690
ids equipment to hear it was actually
done tests on ICS environment before

194
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,820
this guy's done it

195
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,300
how do you have how do you how do you
how do you break something I csr kick it

196
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,150
over just in mass can it right it's
extremely fragile stuff huh how do you

197
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,250
not break it you don't pin test it

198
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,660
yeah pretty much unfortunately um you
know if you're unavailable scanners in

199
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,260
ICS if you have Nessus I right now
whatever you happen to use your

200
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,240
vulnerability systems they break they
will completely stopped a process it

201
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,950
ICS is extremely fragile now we have

202
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,360
to our system we actually have a cisco
firewall as we work for cisco how about

203
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,440
that we have a cisco industrial firewall
down there is actually a trotline as we

204
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,850
go into rockwell meal and set up that
theoretically should stop in that scans

205
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,310
from just destroying our ICS network
that we built

206
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,729
however because none of this has ever
been done before and because you the

207
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,780
audience have shown up and and really
done us a huge favor by showing up we

208
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,930
really appreciate you sitting here maybe
you can find some culpability for so we

209
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,520
didn't even know existed right it's
kinda we brought this you know so by all

210
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,680
means pleased just torch this thing do
your best do your worst

211
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:44,329
try to get some free skate a beer out of
it . when you really start 10.53 on my

212
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,310
back if you win

213
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,530
anybody that's right next to your left
please if you are able to pour yourself

214
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,640
a beer

215
00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:03,410
I'm really authorized to deputize you so
to speak with a rare limited edition

216
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,540
2016 towels challenge coin

217
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,110
well we do not give these out to
everybody we barely gives out people

218
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:16,340
work tell us so uh we can absolutely up
what was the house

219
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:22,730
awesome yeah so if by some chance you
can you can kick over our kegerator if

220
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,920
you can wirelessly pour yourself a beer

221
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,579
I mean to absolutely delighted to find
out how you did it and give you one of

222
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,080
these awesome little star coins we have
currency Italian cisco are they actually

223
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,890
have a needle message written in binary
on the side of the some advanced

224
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,370
schooling or could cool python script
can tell you what it actually says but

225
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,350
these are only two people who can figure
it out

226
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,800
alright so FYI alright that being said
this is our the deets for what we are

227
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
and we can give yourself if you haven't
written down or you don't have a new

228
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,510
memory we have to give some major props
to the folks at minor E works for

229
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,890
getting us in donating one of the one of
the 16 homebrew kegs we have inside of

230
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,359
our fridge they went out of their way
into us a real solid on and we have much

231
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,339
love and respect to those guys for being
able to to do that uh running is

232
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,339
actually doing a zone makerspace in
Washington DC

233
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,349
what's going on chattanooga there

234
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,448
excuse moi I apologize so he's actually
one makerspace down in Chattanooga and

235
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,870
looking for donations because it's gonna
serve i think a lot of underprivileged

236
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,229
folks who can who can do make me wait
and talk about this year I'm gonna give

237
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:35,890
you the floor man stand up please for
the love of God actually it sounds like

238
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:44,320
a cool idea everyone actually have the
salad and so we'd rather give away and

239
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,840
then just do something called teaching
our tradecraft to those were the next

240
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,139
generation is absolutely the best thing
in the world and finding those curious

241
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,590
minds and growing them and empowering
them to do amazing things

242
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,550
infosec is like a passion of mine and
anyone else who's in this industry I

243
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,240
think so i really hope you guys cannot
go to binary works common believe you're

244
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,600
on a Google search of binary works will
take me to them

245
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,809
you'll find them and that would be
totally awesome thank you get binary

246
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:13,420
works much love and respect thank you
for doing that

247
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,080
that being said I told you to be short
and sweet I don't even know what time

248
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,559
were under i want to give you guys more
time to poke at it hack at it and look

249
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,639
at it uh not by too much I think so

250
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,050
wow so yeah absolutely I can absolutely
appalled us

251
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:39,309
uh no do this its last 24 hours last
night yeah those are really my men might

252
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:43,960
be sorry about that arm i can probably
kick out of this room here quite shortly

253
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,630
anybody have any questions i know i've
gone to this pretty fast this whole

254
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,780
thing has been kind of a journey just to
get here to this point

255
00:18:49,780 --> 00:19:00,100
yessir in the very back kind of beer is
it delicious and free booze tcp/ip a and

256
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,459
the other tab is happy

257
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,530
bourbon barrel ale yeah I we've sampled
both because we did some thorough

258
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,010
testing earlier you know you have to be
very careful meticulous about this stuff

259
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,629
and i have to say it was on . both both
both beers were quite delicious

260
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,100
if you want to pour yourself some water
up here we'd be happy to do that for you

261
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,439
as well are but we have to have limited
the limited samples only because

262
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,740
we really want to save some for the
folks who who work hard to get that beer

263
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,129
poured for themselves as well so it's
totally be done

264
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,490
totally be done any other questions

265
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,899
sweet awesome i love seeing that get to
happen get you some beer and I think

266
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:43,529
we're actually literally perfectly on
time

267
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:47,129
awesome thank you very much for showing
up today was appreciated that

268
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,250
oh we're going to try to roll this
