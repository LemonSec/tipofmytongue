1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
over so i'm gonna get moving this is
responder for purple teams derby

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,610
addition i did this at a seaside
cleveland so this is a little bit

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,540
updated and thanks for coming to a
stable target after five o'clock on a

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,939
Friday much appreciate it

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,760
so this is responding for purple teams
will start off i'll give you the finger

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,070
we'll talk about why this talk responder
overview where we'll just talk about the

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,210
tool some related tools the responders a
integral to and then we'll talk about

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,750
the w pat attack that a lot of people
know about because it's getting a lot of

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,160
noise recently and we'll talk about
analyze mode and then some defense for

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,578
responder so giving you the finger if
anyone is familiar with the command I i

11
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,390
am a full-spectrum cyber person I've
been doing this for about 18 years

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,570
defending and occasionally creating
authorized cyber pathogens I'm a

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,930
sporadic sands mentor and conference
speaker and first time at their Derby

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,200
con first time speaking and thank you so
much three con you guys are the best

15
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,100
so this is my selfie if you were to take
it from like the businesses camera right

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,289
this is what i look like to them applied
a snapchat filters didn't do anything

17
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,189
no cuter that doesn't help

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,570
so why do this talk because I think that
all teams doesn't matter if your red or

19
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,048
blue

20
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,020
I think all teams can learn from this
tool there's a lot of interesting

21
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,890
attacks that you need to know about a
lot of misconfigurations that you can

22
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,220
detect with responder and then of course
defense against um but why why would I

23
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:57,990
really do this talk so because my own
security tool betrayed me and that's

24
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,979
that's why I want to do this talk
because as a blue team I'm implemented a

25
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,170
system and it uh essentially just open
up the kimono and it was bad news

26
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,780
so that's why I want to do this so who
is familiar with responder and what it

27
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,410
does

28
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,910
most you okay so just a quick overview i
will talk about it as a broadcast name

29
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,680
resolution protocol poisoner arm will
top talk about it as an authentication

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,840
server for all of these different types
of servers SMB Microsoft's equal HTTP

31
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,630
etc we'll talk about it as a double pad
proxy server and the things you can do

32
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,410
there

33
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,990
it can also act as a dhcp inform spoofer
which is this a if responders on your

34
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,950
network and it sees a dhcp requests come
out it can actually get in the middle of

35
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,320
that and adjust things like the dns
servers or the default gateway pretty

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,030
important stuff it can do OS
fingerprinting it can also detect if the

37
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,560
network is on can do icmp relaying which
might allow you to get into in the

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,520
middle of traffic in a different way and
we'll talk about analyze mode as well

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,080
and this tool is under active
development the latest commit on get

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,220
just occurred at the beginning of
September so they're constantly adding

41
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:21,720
new new features to this thing with
regards to the poisoner so LM and r is a

42
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,570
modern-day uh you know broadcast name
resolution protocol on where if you

43
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,280
don't have a dns server in the way this
thing will allow local systems on a

44
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,810
local subnet to do name resolution
that's all it's about it was implemented

45
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,100
first in windows vista and it continues
up through windows 10 linux also

46
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,900
supports it

47
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,890
netbios name service on the other hand
is old-school windows like Windows NT

48
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,720
type stuff

49
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,410
it's still enabled by default awesome
wins for the win

50
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,120
uh and you know you'll still find out in
the world it's the same function where I

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,140
don't have a hostname so I'm going to
broadcast it out to the world and try to

52
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,519
get resolution and multicast DNS same
sort of thing this is apple's

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,980
implementation they call Bonjour
rendezvous and it's also supported by a

54
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,858
lot of printers and cameras and TiVo's
and Roku's and really weird devices it's

55
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:19,858
all about convenience right you're
trying to put systems on a local subnet

56
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,210
and have them talk and sometimes
convenience will get you into trouble

57
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:32,310
with regards to the off server so it
supports SMB which is a big one right so

58
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:40,560
file shares i can record and collect
credentials clear-text hashes for uh

59
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,080
systems that think they're talking to a
file server $YEAR microsoft sequel same

60
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,599
thing I if if the end . thinks that it's
talking to a Microsoft sequel server it

61
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,110
will just give up its ntlm v1 v2
credentials uh HTTP server looks a lot

62
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,630
like is if you if you look at it from an
nmap standpoint and it will also collect

63
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:10,200
clear text and hashed credentials and
also serve up w pat . that which we'll

64
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,310
talk a little more about and then for
clear-text credentials

65
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,500
nothing's better than some of the older
protocols like ftp pop3 IMAP responder

66
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,639
will pretend to be all of these things
in in the hopes that you will just get

67
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:32,520
credentials and so it will record them
so quick overview of the SMB attack we

68
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,320
always have to have our victims and our
attacker who will no doubt be wearing a

69
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:44,400
ski mask in and a tie and typing with
one hand as you do on so this is

70
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,630
basically how it works where you have a
victim who maybe miss types they're

71
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,400
trying to get to a file share and they
say whack serve are they mistyped they

72
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,810
want men to get the server that they
missed typed in a type serve our Saudi

73
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,940
ms is like what are you talking about i
don't have an entry for that so the

74
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,419
client if configured to do so will be
come out and say to the world on its

75
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:11,039
local subnet hey I'm looking for this
serve our where is this thing and the

76
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,360
attacker running responder on that same
subnet will say hey that's me

77
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,650
send me your challenge here's my
challenge and then the the end . will

78
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,200
respond back with either ntlm v1 or v2
creds at that point the attacker can

79
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,039
take that and attempt to crack those
credentials offline or they can use it

80
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,039
for man-in-the-middle type situation

81
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,670
so some related tools to responder and
they is a powershell implementation of

82
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:47,080
responder actively updated and being
being developed right alongside Gladius

83
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,150
is an auto crack tool for responder so
it will just essentially monitor the

84
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,370
responder filesystem and anytime you see
a at any time it sees a new set of

85
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,060
hashes it'll just start cracking them
send them right over to John ripper and

86
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,490
let's just get to it and then chuckle is
especially interesting this is like a

87
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,840
tool kit that will take all of these
various tools and put them into one

88
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,260
place to allow you to do file share type
compromise so system it will go out fine

89
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,550
systems that can get in front of you
generate a payload will get bypassed by

90
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,020
a virus using the the veil evasion
framework will intercept the SNB

91
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,409
connection and then deliver the payload
using responder and SMB rate relay and

92
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:37,210
then it will give you a shell via
interpreter uh in the Metasploit

93
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,640
framework and very interesting to
mention uh Rob Fuller's attack that was

94
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,750
recently discussed he has an attack
where you can essentially grab

95
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,310
credentials for a system that has a
locked screen so you can walk up to any

96
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:57,550
machine that has a lock screen and put
in a USB land turtle from hak5 or the

97
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:04,300
USB armory up and have the machine will
essentially I just give its credentials

98
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,460
over to this new network interface it's
running responder Nick shows up systems

99
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,659
interested in talking to two it over
that interface and you end up with

100
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,780
credentials and give you a nice flashing
light once you actually have your

101
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:23,349
credentials so the w pad proxy thing
will dig into this a little bit because

102
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,260
again it's getting a lot of noise but so
responder will listen to and broadcast

103
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:35,020
and pretend to be a w pad uh server so
what the w pad is if you go into

104
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,520
internet explorer and pull up your
options you'll see there's a checkbox

105
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,730
that is checked by default that says no
auto detect my proxy settings

106
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,700
that's w pass

107
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,130
and it's there by default so what
happens is with that checkbox checked

108
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,360
the system will constantly beating when
beginning whenever wants to talk about

109
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,990
the Internet hey who is my proxy tell me
who my proxy is and responder will say

110
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,220
hey that's me

111
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,220
you wanna do you wanna talk to me you
won't talk to internet you go through me

112
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,150
right

113
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:13,010
and in the meantime you're you're
meddling the traffic you can grab a

114
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,600
authentication data you can on
unencrypted sites you can inject HTML

115
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,390
which is handy and then if you see a
client talking through your responder

116
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,340
proxy looking to download an exe over
HTTP you can say it you know what you

117
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,690
don't want that one you want mine and
give it may be a malicious exe that has

118
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,900
a back door in it won't get detected by
antivirus all that kind of thing

119
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,220
now this particular attack is pretty
well known i'm not saying anything new

120
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,830
the first information presented about
this attack was at a DEFCON in the late

121
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:54,500
to thousands David Kennedy did a post on
the Trust's trusted tech blog and like

122
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:01,430
2012 i think 2013 and then even at
blackhat this year there were like four

123
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,530
talks talking about w pad and us-cert
issued a warning about the thing about

124
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,819
how horrible it is so it's like on one
hand you have mines being blown like

125
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,390
this is crazy and insane and really
terrible but on the other side other

126
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:20,240
hand but the greater pentest communities
like okay I guess is bad and kinda known

127
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,240
about this right now and no i don't
think so

128
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:31,130
the w pat attack is the same thing as
the SMB thing right you get your sheep

129
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,290
who are out there asking for w pad
servers misconfigured end . whatever and

130
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,270
they said where's my w pad server

131
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,069
I don't know so it begins out to the
local subnet the attacker who's running

132
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,150
responder says hey that's me and is now
man-in-the-middle for all the browser

133
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:54,829
traffic pretty bad stuff really easy to
do it's scarily easy to do so

134
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:59,489
talk about analyze mode for a second and
this is really where the blue team kind

135
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:04,499
of comes in to play so let's take a look
at what endpoints could be compromised

136
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:08,579
be an interesting thing right but what
about systems that are you eager to

137
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,829
authenticate which tend to be blue team
systems so inventory systems I want to

138
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:18,359
know what's out on the network kind of a
blue team type function right patch

139
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,069
management software deployment i want to
deploy software to your end . on and

140
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:26,790
then there's network access control
another blue team tool and the one that

141
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,889
betrayed me some Italian magnetic joke

142
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:36,420
I'm sorry goes like this responder says
knack

143
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,779
hey i'm on your network neck and then
access who's there and responder says

144
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,639
some really weird box

145
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,999
I don't look like anything you've ever
seen before I'm so weird like I'm just

146
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:52,259
really weird and the neck is like some
really weird box who you know what

147
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:58,139
nevermind i'm just gonna send your
credentials for a domain admin ok right

148
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:04,139
ntlm version one hash and da username so
that hashes garbage i can crack it in 10

149
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,129
minutes

150
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:10,199
so what that really translates to is I
connected a cali box to the network with

151
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:15,449
analyze mode running in responder and 30
seconds later I received back a domain

152
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:21,839
admin username and ntlm v1 response
which at this point I think we've kind

153
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,389
of reached peak fail because a system
that was meant to turn rogue and points

154
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:31,410
and detect them and kick them off the
network is actually being sent very

155
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,980
highly privileged credentials the most
highly privileged credentials should we

156
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,769
give there was no mention of ntlm v1 or
anything in the documentation it was

157
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:46,860
built / the vendor stocks again
responder running on this network looks

158
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,329
nothing like a Windows domain member
right looks nothing like it's why would

159
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:57,689
you ever send me da username and and
hash it was like to this this happiness

160
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:01,379
denied moment where I was like hey guys
we got this really cool solution we're

161
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,379
going to find all the rogaine points
where do really great stuff all

162
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:13,680
not so much . so much so for kids right
exactly poor knack getting kicked over

163
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,770
like that Soyuz analyze mode i guess is
the point your blue team tools might be

164
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,699
betraying you

165
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,630
they might be configured the way that
you were told to configure them but they

166
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,650
might actually be doing bad things on
your end points might be misconfigured

167
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:33,360
your network might allow icmp relay and
you would never know that list you

168
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,640
looked at layer 3 config on your core
switch or whatever responder dangerous

169
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,660
for pen test is the point so I fired up
analyze mode here at the recon and just

170
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,449
found a couple systems that were being a
misbehaving i guess a couple of looking

171
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,460
for w pad couple looking for

172
00:13:53,460 --> 00:14:01,740
I don't know what so shame on them so
with regards to to respond defense

173
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,420
disable these protocols zero
configuration type protocols get rid of

174
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:06,719
them

175
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,150
the great in your house they're no good
in the enterprise system disabled w pad

176
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:16,890
and set explicit proxies if you need to
and you probably don't even need to but

177
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,580
if you do you can set them you don't
need to say okay just broadcast out to

178
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,890
the world to find your proxy right and
then scan for responder instances

179
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:30,240
they're easy to find and there are a
couple of tools that can help you and

180
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,610
SMB signing is another way to deter that
that the fuck man in the middle SMB

181
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,430
attack but it could be painful from a
legacy file server legacy seen as type

182
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:47,880
scenario it's very very good if you and
map file server windows 2012 by default

183
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,970
and it's a file server it's going to
come back and say you know what you

184
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,680
don't have SMB signing turned on and you
really should but getting it turned on

185
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,060
across all file servers is not easy it's
something you should definitely dig into

186
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:09,869
to prevent that particular attack was I
want behind i'm sorry i was probably on

187
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:16,589
all right so to detect it automates the
men map scans so from the blue team side

188
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:22,200
and a responder has a very tail tail and
map signature it looks like nothing

189
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,790
you've ever seen for the red team yet
you can modify that make it look like

190
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:33,599
anything you want blue team a there's a
very telltale w pat . that again can be

191
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,220
modified but why would you ever have
some end point out in your world that is

192
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,470
serving up w pad unless you told it to
so just look for those kind of instances

193
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,280
you shouldn't have something sitting on
your network serving up this potentially

194
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,829
malicious file and any endpoint running
on any of these ports like would you

195
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:57,390
want something sitting on your client
subnets that's listening for email and

196
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,860
and file shares and it's got a web
server and oh it's a sequel server to

197
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,820
know that's a weird things you should
never have that kind of system on your

198
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,710
on your network at all

199
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:14,820
this is an nmap fingerprint of you if
you scan a responder box all of these

200
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,589
ports that are listed up here

201
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:20,400
those are reports that responders
listening to off by default so a number

202
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,270
of weirdo tcp and UDP ports that you
probably don't want to see hanging

203
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:29,250
around look at port 8000 normal was at
right it's an is server it's a windows

204
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:34,980
2003 server it's got a weird domain name
weird netbios name

205
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,160
I don't want that that's online right
pretty pretty clear the email servers

206
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,189
what's going on there like very strange

207
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:50,760
same with the this is the iso server
that stood up for the w pat attack

208
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,790
saying is Python why would I have an
item microsoft aissa server that's

209
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,969
written in python it's not it's not true

210
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,390
so these are some telltale things if you
look at the w pad file itself

211
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,639
I it tells you right there the responder
serve this up in a few different places

212
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,360
again you can customize this but if
you're looking for somebody script

213
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,479
kiddie like somebody just standing up an
instance of responder you can call them

214
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,480
out real quick if you're looking for
this stuff

215
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,950
so assuming you've done all this
assuming you've you've shut off all

216
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,069
these broke broadcast protocols across
your environment which I'll tell you how

217
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:32,679
to do in a little bit and I tried to
save a little time then start looking

218
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,640
for systems that are broadcasting and
are misbehaving because they're probably

219
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,400
not yours so here are some things you
can do there are from from a network

220
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,320
perspective you can have a tap on your
user traffic you know span for whatever

221
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,210
thats mirroring your user traffic send
that to your IDs for your sim look for w

222
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,400
pad files i use an ACL to filter
interesting traffic if you don't want to

223
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,090
flood the sensor with a bunch of garbage
you can put an apple on that stuff

224
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:07,750
pretty easily configure an IP helper
address too . your sim sensors that's

225
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:14,110
interesting because I p helpers
typically used for dhcp but it will

226
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:20,139
forward UDP broadcast across subnets so
if you just tell by default on a cisco

227
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:27,040
environment you can say IP helper and it
will automatically forward a UDP 137

228
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,120
which is named netbios name service if
you just add this line at the bottom the

229
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,969
ipv4 protocol UDP 5355 that will also
get your lmn are heading towards

230
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,050
whatever I be helping you configure so
then if you have a sensor listening as

231
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,860
an IP helper you actually see these
broadcast come across and say wait a

232
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:51,370
second why are you doing that I told you
not to do that and there is a tool to

233
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,060
actually fish responder which is really
cool so if somebody's running responder

234
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:59,050
on your network and you won't find them
you can use this this is from the guys

235
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,879
at nets by it's a Python script called
spotter you have to run on a per subnet

236
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,820
basis but essentially it begins out
every five seconds and says hey I'm

237
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,230
looking for some garbage hostname you
can figure that right just beacons and

238
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,270
if someone's running responder respond
will say hey I know I know what that is

239
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,530
and you can say no you don't it's a
garbage host gotcha

240
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:27,100
and it will actually send you an email
and say hey this is a this is no good

241
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,480
and it's a Python script and use escapee
so you could potentially write the

242
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,650
script to say okay

243
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,520
it's for to syslog to the sim or
something like that to say we just

244
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,800
caught someone running responder you can
also do some interesting things with IP

245
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,690
directed broadcast where you're actually
a broadcasting a single instance of

246
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,740
school spotter across multiple subnets
you have to be able to catch the

247
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,890
response though so you have to have a
tap-in place to catch the response

248
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,830
because that won't get you the response
and then I thought about responder honey

249
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:06,460
pots so like what if we had our own blue
team instance of responder that was only

250
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,190
there to catch people who are looking
for things that they shouldn't be

251
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,080
looking for so let's add some fake
entries to our DFS namespace or two dns

252
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:21,790
that says like security quack security
domain com or you know of CDO pay .

253
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:26,200
domain.com like things that that would
be interesting and then if somebody

254
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,600
actually tries to access those fake
entries will now not only do you know

255
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,330
they should have been doing that but you
know what credentials they did it with

256
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,540
so that could be helpful in tracking
down an attacker

257
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:43,270
so really quick because i only got a
couple minutes

258
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,780
this is how you disable ll MN MN are not
gonna leave it up here long enough but

259
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:55,030
the slide that will be available just
google it you can disable netbios name

260
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,350
service out the totally brushed past but
i should say group policy you can do

261
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,830
this

262
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,600
register you can do this with with
regards to the netbios name service you

263
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,169
can do it registry dhcp and group policy
w pad same thing and you can do weird

264
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,400
things with dhcp in the windows world to
where you can actually configure a false

265
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:22,420
w pad file via DHCP don't want to do
that and then to actually serve up a

266
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:29,830
fake name or fake server 44 w pad free
dns servers you actually have to follow

267
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,970
this instruction from Microsoft because
they actually don't allow you to

268
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,730
configure w pat server for security
reasons I don't know

269
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,120
questions

270
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,120
nothin

271
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,660
alright well like I said five o'clock on
a friday thanks for coming to my talk
