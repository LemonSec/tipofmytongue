1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
you'll ever hear we're good alright cool
so welcome to a hash cat state of the

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,330
union

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,679
hi my name is redacted I work for and
acted I might have some certifications

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,869
unfortunate all redacted I've hobbies
they're also all redacted i might be the

5
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,730
bishop of the church Wi-Fi version 3 or
any greater version and I'm also

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,880
remember team hash gather along with a
few other people in the room i think we

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,159
see me up here in a few other folks now
for the disclaimers my opinions are mine

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,419
and mine alone

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,989
don't take any of this with any kind of
real seriousness some stuff changes

10
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,790
really really fast

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,170
I'm not a hashcash developer I just do a
lot of the testing for random stuff all

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,550
the real hard works done by adam and his
friends so none of that saw me no

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,260
warranties expressed or implied he
guaranteed on that my employer is in no

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,760
way affiliated with this talk

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,000
don't tell them here my power skills
suck

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,690
I'm absolutely not sorry for this at all
in any way shape and form so why real

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,539
here last year in the hash cat world
things have changed dramatically in a

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,970
whole number changes have gone on to go
through some of those new ones there

19
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,490
might be some cool stuff that they have
to go through the change logs everything

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,490
else we show you how to do some work
until in person

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,080
version1 reversing to straighten hell a
match for pass the hash and i may or may

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,970
not bash AMD like last year so where we
last year 2015 was a really weird and

23
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,700
interesting time we had three versions
of hash cat it was closed source there

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,750
is cash get cpu wholesale hash get to
hash cat no fpga support and things kind

25
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,689
of they worked you know we r beta keys
to deal with we had to deal with now

26
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,079
really crappy middleware that didn't
work quite so well so yeah things have

27
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,699
kind of changed a bit

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,100
so the biggest one hash cat is gone
open-sourced MIT license Stephen you can

29
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,990
see all the code and go play whatever
you want there's no more time bombs is

30
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,060
more beta key files

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,690
and the best part is you no longer have
to use John the river because there's

32
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,620
bits like GPU Colonel's des cracking
actually completed a reason a lot of

33
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,190
time before the universe ends the code
is up on get up by the way and the best

34
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:31,680
part is i had to put this up here even
magnum likes hash cat so you have Joan

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,600
Rivers dead i'm sorry

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,400
so the coolest part of a task at most
recent ones that emerged the cpu and GPU

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,920
hash cat into one common as of three
point out so it's the old stuffs down

38
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,119
called hash got legacy use one thing
works for fpga works for GPU works for

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,620
CPU and the coolest part now is going to
GPU and cpu during the same freaking

40
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,900
crack run so it works

41
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,590
they've also dropped two supports
whichever through opencl so it's one

42
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,680
common setup have also changed the rules
so you can use way longer rules but max

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,700
out about 50k or so you can modify that
but it's all good

44
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,109
we also bsd support so when systemd
comes out and you guys hate using Ubuntu

45
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,050
and have been crashes you can get a real
operating system looking out God

46
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,880
intended

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,340
there's also US auto tuned engines and
yes you Mac fanboys can run hash cat in

48
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:31,170
your max now but switch to a real
computer please don't you remember how

49
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,220
to use the old-fashioned ash and ash you
to know your setups and everything else

50
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,840
is a pain in the ass nothing ever worked
as a nice to autotune engine now it's

51
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,360
all tied down to your workload profile
so you can specify you know 141 watch

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,810
the play games while you're running
credit history and background or the

53
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,900
dash for to adjust all your dash & ashes
for you

54
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,880
there's also a a database now that you
can go to your modifications to control

55
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,750
your runtime so you can tune things up
like my rigs are just ridiculous 7w 40

56
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,920
desktop response being crack all day
long without having serious issues so is

57
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,380
taking some of the guesswork out of
trying to crack a hash there's also

58
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,329
automatic hardware management stuff like
you know automatic power to taking care

59
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,669
of for the md's alone no one actually
likes AMD please stop using them but

60
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,540
that's all taken care of there's also
control of invidi over nvm l all that

61
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,490
stuff works great

62
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,130
highly highly highly recommended
performance there was a model

63
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,969
performance dropped pre Maxwell cards
for nvidia but if you're using a pre

64
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,880
maximal card just saw your card and get
a new

65
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,840
979 60 just stop using please I mean you
should be a five-year-old card for a GPU

66
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,710
cracking your laptop's give you better
performance anyways but there's some

67
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,580
serious performance increases net ntlm
for watching one for example as a

68
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,530
hundred percent increase so things have
gotten unique there is a google doc with

69
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:08,549
all the guides Mellie use it love it no
your workloads the coolest part though

70
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,800
is now there's no generic does key
support this means you can you do $TIME

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,880
a.m. known plaintext attack against des
and reverse the keys which is great for

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,930
ntlm version one you shouldn't use the
protocol but we demonstrate how cool is

73
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,850
this is not in the mainstream released
three . 10 it is only the current get up

74
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,660
release so make sure you get check out
before you run this but i'll be going

75
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,660
too slow walk through on this and it's
be pretty cool

76
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,460
he also cracked eat as adobe stuff
there's new stuff coming out all the

77
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,500
time that we've been doing testing on
this but does pass-through mode 14,000

78
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,350
is the best so the demo this attain your
Intel and beauty channel version

79
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,980
challenger responder the hak5 land
turtle attacks the people and playing

80
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,120
around with all the fun stuff we got in
here challenge however we do it legally

81
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:05,130
of course please remove the 99 and a
pipe it through base64 decode to make it

82
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:12,690
look like this so and then telling
version one challenge is actually split

83
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,760
up in the really three components to it

84
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,950
you've got your challenge component one
you got your part to your PT 3 and you

85
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,960
have your fixed challenge the part the
part in red is your ntlm version one

86
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,210
challenge the fix challenge of her nose
and responder and yeah I work in a

87
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,049
second so typically if you wanna crack
until version one it'll take a while

88
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:40,110
because it's not straight ntlm the nice
part is PT 1 and C 2 youtube are

89
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,650
generated the same plain text challenge
so you can multi hash the key space is

90
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,849
only 256

91
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:51,669
so you may cash fall out of this you
know run through your decoder you spit

92
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:57,938
her out or if you're lazy like me used a
little bash and do it all fully

93
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:03,999
automatically this we posted on the hash
cat forums so you guys can not do this

94
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:07,059
all so i actually have this posted right
after the slides you want to write this

95
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:10,990
long said text down but i believe in
automation rather than manually

96
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,860
selecting bit set up a field with the
other it with the heck stops it's just a

97
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,339
pain in the ass pussy prepare your hash
file get ready to roll

98
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:25,449
anyone hash get on it and it takes you
know maximum of eleven days on any GPU

99
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,919
rate which is kind of ridiculous it's
still long but it's still not practical

100
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,469
to speed this up we need our nodes so
traditionally you had two options one

101
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:41,558
was made aware of things like hash stack
hash to push Ashton pussy crack Lord

102
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:47,860
make his custom stuff but i'll be honest
i hate middleware it mangles everything

103
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,110
your stuff comes out takes forever to
get the support the middleware so I got

104
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:59,979
bored one night and IRC and i wrote a
job distribution calculator but first

105
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:05,289
get back to you know here's a quick demo
you know 11 days for a maximum crack not

106
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:08,740
terribly bad but yeah I got really
really really annoyed about this skip in

107
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,459
the calculation components in contest
you have to go distributor jobs at your

108
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:18,339
friends to your manual dash dash L this
new method works over telephone RC email

109
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:21,969
stone tablet smoke signals could
probably make it work it's not too bad

110
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:28,029
but again i hate middleware so you
download little script you fill out how

111
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:34,299
many GPU nodes you have and how many
gp's you have so you say you got 89 TZ

112
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,338
nineties yeah and the stack of notes
with four nineties and there he splitter

113
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,829
load default key space in the script is
built for the Des mode 1400 but the

114
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:48,310
first argument of the script is feeding
the keyspace out of your dash key space

115
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,489
and it'll let you adjust a few things so
you run the script and it spits out a

116
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,720
copy and paste the whole dash and that's
values so you know get the truck to your

117
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,050
friend

118
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,279
and run a junk on this no drunk on that
note none of the overhead of having to

119
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,680
deal with the whole cluster controller
with hundreds around massive disc in all

120
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,219
the expenses that come with it's just
all taken care of

121
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,950
so you take your you know IM crack
method and to go through a crack at the

122
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,769
dash on this it's no hash got cash and
load 1400 your hash file open two guys

123
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:29,380
cracked attack mode 3 easy care sets
there's actually does full care set now

124
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,769
in there so you're ready to roll on that
because it uses a slightly custom one

125
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:37,510
router using the question be your
question 8 you feel the karyotype file

126
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,670
I'm question 1 give or click profile
copy your dash dsl and drops down to

127
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:49,300
maximum of two days and none of the
hassle of middleware so with six nodes

128
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,870
you know two days that's not bad that's
the other within the scope of a pen test

129
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,300
add more nodes yet do more work only
catches up to crack the easy to make

130
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,899
your keys still usable so adamant some
missile probably perl scripts for a lot

131
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:06,970
and I made things even easier some more
bash to generate you your completed

132
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,920
password are going to be allowed so as a
comparison what this does is CP 1 is

133
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:19,779
that crash component 1 CP 2 is a great
component two and then pt3 is the final

134
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:30,939
piece of your Intel and hash that was
indicated right right here that 5816 you

135
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:37,029
piece it all together and you know have
a working ntlm version or ntlm hash my

136
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:40,720
where you have a working in tlm hash
they can pass the hash with whatever

137
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,529
having to crack the password and
everyone still has ntlm one their

138
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:46,570
environments right you've turned that
all off

139
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,670
No nice and easy two days the past could
be 30 characters long

140
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,410
you can still use it for a pass if they
saw the version one on so yeah things

141
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,449
have changed a bit things have gotten
faster

142
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,540
I kind of sped through this whole piece
so I've got time to go through and have

143
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,760
a whole ton of questions

144
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,149
the biggest thing though is there's now
a hundred and sixty different hash modes

145
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,440
so for all intents and purposes you can
now use this in place of john the ripper

146
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:11,939
that

147
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:16,978
most the output bugs it's fully open
source so there is no more reason to you

148
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:20,699
know get on hash got any more special
thank you to Adam special thinking and

149
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:25,799
mingle special thank you to everybody on
Team hash get this helps over the years

150
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,149
showing school things teaching us
everything I would not be here for the

151
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,869
Giants before me and I hope you'll do
really cool things to you want to build

152
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:34,589
it

153
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,879
here's how you build it and I'm i will
post all the stuff on the hash get forms

154
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,769
after this is all said and done and that
my friends is it nobody for questions

155
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:57,749
minga yes he's cracking take you know
let ya know they know their numbers were

156
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:58,949
they lying

157
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:06,358
it's all lowercase our well it's all
actually read into the set its with the

158
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:11,189
Des its automated keyspace file for it I
get a double check the co-chairs of all

159
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,189
I see is handed to me some lazy the
script kitty

160
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,419
yeah they're just random like the
alphanumeric with a little bit special

161
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:34,228
character stuff in it now standard
anyone else bueller bueller you know

162
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:39,419
it's funny I gave an entire talk on that
Derby con one Steve were be able to talk

163
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:45,209
on using amazon ec2 and I was back on
their GPS socked a lot of new cloud

164
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:49,319
service providers are vastly improving
with their GPU capabilities so if you

165
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:55,139
don't have the money to build a proper
rig renting out amazon ec2 for you a

166
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,369
couple of hours

167
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:59,249
I mean cost of a thousand bucks but if
you got the money is better than

168
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:03,929
spending 30 40 grand on giant cracking
rig or paying my rates are makers rates

169
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:09,119
but i still prefer building on Riggs

170
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:14,069
I mean it's nice bill walk up and drop
70 billion into Lemke's per second on

171
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:16,780
somebody

172
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:27,880
i'll be honest i haven't used a cloud
service in about five years so if you

173
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,700
have proper cloud service we want to
crack for you and pushes a couple

174
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,920
consultants here the whole paper it

175
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,640
the other option is you can lease your
rigs now if you want to go talk to the

176
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,530
structure group associated systems will
sell you a premade regularly see one and

177
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,760
i believe they may be talking or
producing a solution but not I know

178
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,960
contact the core logic guys painting a
lot of money and he'll crack them for

179
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,060
you

180
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,060
anybody else

181
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,920
now i know it was quick if you don't
want to go sit through and do like a

182
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,410
live demo in this I can't show you on
camera what I'm doing but I can

183
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,600
definitely go through a demo on how to
crack this over beer at the bar i'm able

184
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,720
to squirm on ninja evil mug on IRC and
answer questions and IRC almost all day

185
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,820
everyday so feel free going over
