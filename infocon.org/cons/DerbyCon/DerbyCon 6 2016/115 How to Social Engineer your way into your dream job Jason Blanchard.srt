1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,540
the time to start i can start right yeah
yeah that's three clock

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,939
hello everybody hey is my very first
time getting a chance to speak at Derby

3
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,609
con thank you for coming

4
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,599
I i think i put in the description if
you feel stuck in your job or you're not

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:35,579
happy with work so look at all you just
like yeah I want to get the hell out of

6
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,260
this one job I got so a couple things is
uh I generally do stand-up comedy

7
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,690
I also generally move around a lot when
I present i cannot do that today because

8
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,760
i am attached to the podium so we have
had any . i pass out or fall over

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,360
something has happened and i'll get to
that in a second

10
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,789
speaking of which a few things before we
get totally into the beginning when I

11
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,670
get nervous I tell jokes which is really
good in a setting like this because it's

12
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,330
fun it's great for you guys but it's
terrible when my wife is arguing and

13
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:19,140
she's like I don't like this that's that
that and she's like this is really

14
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,780
serious things like I know that's why
I'm laughing it's just can't help it so

15
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,509
i don't know if you've ever seen the
movie Marlene me anyone everything

16
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,140
Martin yeah I had to leave the theater
because I couldn't stop laughing

17
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:46,610
like it was terrible and I was like
everyone's crying I my god so i hit i am

18
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,400
prone to anxiety and panic attacks

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,760
I don't know about if you've ever
experienced but from time to time and i

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,310
will just completely lock up or whatever

21
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,070
symptoms may be increased heart rate
good muffled sound all the sudden I

22
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,869
can't hear like anything around me and
1,000 yard stare

23
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:13,940
if at any point I just I'm having one so
i can I become way too self-aware like

24
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,980
also i can hear my voice I know where my
hand is in my left pocket which is weird

25
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,600
so I'm going to take that out now all of
a sudden I get really self-aware and the

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,079
reason why is because i have self-doubt
you know I woke up this morning at 6am

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,240
and I like people are coming to listen
to me I better say something and then

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,209
some of that is the fears of being
judged or criticized or rejected and I

29
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,740
don't know if you've ever had these
feelings but I'm saying to you right now

30
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,330
even though i have these feelings i'm up
here and I'm hoping this goes well but

31
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,950
the thing about this is i turn this into
a mutant ability I grew up with comic

32
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,850
books i worked in the compact industry
and i believe in even abilities you have

33
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,660
this thing about you that helps you in
certain situations so I believe my

34
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,280
anxiety and panic attacks help me and so
many other situations I feel like I'm

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,080
not even in that situation and like it's
not even happening like stuffs happening

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,160
but I don't care it's like it's not a
thing like right now you can

37
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,970
but the reason I like i said i'm telling
you this is one because if I say it out

38
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,500
loud it no longer becomes a fear and
then the other thing is if you ever

39
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,830
experiences or as I'm going through
these slides all of a sudden you start

40
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,350
thinking about the things that you may
have to do that's way out of your

41
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,250
comfort zone

42
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,410
you may start thinking or something but
I having fun and that's fine i do too

43
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,680
but I still get up onstage I still do
the things you can still do those things

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,250
too

45
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,500
it's just going to be uncomfortable like
this right now and I just wanted to say

46
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,740
that I either even though that the
company I work for is a sponsor of this

47
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,320
event I am NOT here on behalf of that
company so if you see me working booze

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,489
I'm not here to help sell something i'm
just here because I wanted to submit a

49
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,320
CFP for derby county thought that cool
and your current employer may not

50
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,150
appreciate the things i'm about the same
if your current employer like you went

51
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,150
to what at Derby come how to find your
dream job

52
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,620
do you know what it's like to tell your
current employer i'm about to give a

53
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,390
talk at a infosec conference about how
to social engineer near your way into

54
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:33,750
your dream job really did you do that to
us kind of all right so what you may be

55
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:41,160

he's a marketing but do you even

56
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,680
security bro and I get this a lot mainly
from one person his name Steven hills

57
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,730

58
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:55,200
whenever I post something this is his
response to all and the answer to your

59
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,469
question is no I don't security bro I
don't but that's why you should kind of

60
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,680
listen to this talk about how to market
yourself how to promote yourself how to

61

64
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,650
that you guys do the things that I do is
I help people find work and I'm you know

65
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,159

listened to those parts i'll listen to

66
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,580
those things that you know

67
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,318
but then when I got accepted for derby
con I got this in response i was like so

68
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:45,849
excited I am I talk about accepted a
derby khan and then this all right now I

69
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:51,639
don't security bro like i said i was
born a Nigerian prince i was born I was

70
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,500
born this way and I didn't realize what
my natural gifts were until about $YEAR

71
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,680
i was eight and my mom who used to yard
sales was having yard so she said Jason

72
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,060
you want to help the art sale today and
i said no i don't and she's like what do

73
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,860
you want to sell like snacks at the yard
sale make some money and I was like okay

74
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,319
Carol let's take some brownies and some
tasty cakes and we'll take him out the

75
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,870
packages and then you sell them for more
than we bought the package for was ok

76
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,750
and it worked i made like 10 15 bucks a
day and then i reinvested that ten and

77
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,090
fifteen dollars into candy and then I
took that the school and I was a candy

78
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:42,849
dealer in the second grade I was selling
now laters and blow pops and the nurse i

79
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:48,969
was making bank bank i had a fanny pack
because it's the eighties I had a fanny

80
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:53,620
pack and a fanny pack was full of candy
and I was bringing in money every single

81
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:01,479
day I was like the Heisenberg and Jesse
of that school and so I'm just this way

82
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,699
hi that's the thing that I am but the
reason why I called this how to search

83
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:09,699
engineer way into your dream job is one
I wanted people to show up because I

84
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,599
thought you would think that was cool
like I had a certain it now not really

85
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,210
kinda so the difference between social
engineering marketing is very slim is

86
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,750
very different and very a new difference
my entire day like most of my day the

87
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,639
work that I do internally what I'm
thinking is pleased with the love of God

88
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,899
click the link i put the link on twitter
and put the link in your email i'll put

89
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,520
the link here but they're just like

90
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,940
link just click it and you know what
every single phishing attack is thinking

91
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:47,889
just click the link just click the link
release the mouse I'm the same way I

92
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,979
just like i want you to click the link
find out about things and buy it if you

93
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:53,859
want to but the thing i wanna talk about
today's there's a difference between

94
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,300
deception persuasion nothing I talked
about today what I want you to be

95
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,169
deceptive when you're pretty presenting
yourself promoting yourself talking

96
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:05,799
about yourself you're not being
deceptive you're being persuasive you're

97
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,130
telling people who you are what skills
you have the abilities that you can do

98
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,990
that kind of stuff but you're not lying
about it there's a difference and then I

99
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,949
believe there's a difference between a
scam artist and a salesperson and this

100
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,930
difference is this if you believe the
thing that you're selling is good for

101
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,039
the other person if you're if you think
it's going to benefit them or fix

102
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,580
something in their life in your
salesperson you're making their life

103
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,078
better if you were just doing it to make
money to make your life better than your

104
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:36,098
scam artist

105
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,709
so think about yourself if you're gonna
go work for company are you going to

106
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,550
work for that company just to absorb
their money and not do anything for you

107
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,729
to go work for a company where you're
actually contributing and making that

108
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,370
company better because if you think
you're going to accompany make it better

109
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,000
then you're being a salesperson of your
skills and abilities if you're just

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,589
going there to scan you being scam
artists and deceptive and I can't help

111
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:02,620
you with that and then I get this a lot

112
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:09,100
am I being confident or areas ah most of
you today will leave gone what I

113
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,100
arrogant bastard

114
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:20,950
my wife is sitting in the front round
she'll be one of the honey okay alright

115
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,430
moving on

116
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:30,640
ok so why are you in this talk you know
I was thinking about why you would wait

117
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,250
in that line out there why you would
come in this room I would just sit down

118
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,750
why would you listen to this guy and I
was thinking maybe you're curious like

119
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,170
what the hell is this guy going to talk
about i have nothing to do between three

120
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,000
and four might as well maybe some of you
here for skill development or like maybe

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,050
he had a thing that i could add to my
skills of do

122
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,380
in social engineering or sand gathering
or something like that maybe you're

123

book called the dip and it is a tiny

140

146
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,599
are you actually is a time to just quit
and go try something else so I do highly

147
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,560
recommends Irene just about every year
or every two years you know to see if i

148
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,680
should keep the dollar grown-up stuff
like that

149
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,649
that was weird i said that out loud

150
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,920
alright so when you're looking at coming
up with a dream job a tip for you is to

151
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,199
make a list of once and a person very
near and dear to me i can I say what

152
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:14,050
you're doing ok so when you're thinking
about that dream job actually write down

153
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,569
what is seriously write down what the
dream job is because if you don't if

154
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,110
it's like you have I talked to a lot of
used to teach and talk to a lot of

155
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:30,880
students like so what's your dream job
by making enough money good guy and i

156
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,870
would say well what's enough enough

157
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,480
oh I was so you haven't really planned
this out okay for me enough money is I

158
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,970
never have to worry about eating ever
like that's enough money i never have to

159
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,740
worry about food i will always have food
that's enough money you know I could

160
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,760
want a boat

161
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:59,200
I don't really want to vote honey I'm
just I don't know why both become so

162
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,650
make a list of your ones like specific
once not enough or in the future stuff

163
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:11,170
yet so if you pursue your dream job here
are some things that are going to happen

164
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,459
to you if you're sitting in this room
right now you're like you know I'm

165
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,969
thinking about it your heart started to
beat a little bit faster your night you

166
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,990
know let's go for that dream job
starting tomorrow

167
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,040
it's like when you're going to die it
like tomorrow I'm starting that diet but

168
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,339
if you really start thinking like
tomorrow i want to pursue my dream job

169
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:34,990
you will grow to be creates you will
grow to be created right now you're not

170
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,630
but you will grow to be courageous

171
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,970
I want to do a little experiment raise
your hand if you're shot exactly like

172
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,510
there's half of you put your hand up the
other half was like but onto shot raise

173
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,319
my and

174
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,100
this we're all of us are shy

175
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,670
we are we're just shy people and and in
the infosec community even more shy than

176
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,500
other communities I've been part of it
just shy a lot of that shines comes from

177
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,390
rejection that shines comes from you
know fear all kinds of fears and things

178
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,050
like that but you're shy and so the one
thing i want to want you to think about

179
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:19,120
think of a social engineer for the shy
maybe on the inside but when it's time

180
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,800
to do what they do they take on a
persona they take on a role they take on

181
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,060
you-know-what for the next 15 minutes i
can hop on this phone and i will fish

182
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,430
the hell is this person

183
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:42,069
yeah and when they're done with that
calling here buying an exciting all the

184
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:47,500
same time but when you leave this room
here today that shyness what if you

185
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,060
practice 30 seconds of courageousness
what if you when you leave this room you

186
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,439
know you know what for the next 15
minutes i'm not going to be shy and you

187
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,690
go up and you talk to random strangers
for 15 minutes after this if all of you

188
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:09,910
do it you're gonna freak all of them out
so maybe just mill around in the hallway

189
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:17,020
talk to each other you're going to
stretch your skills so structure skills

190
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,140
because you can have to learn new things
to be able to get that job that you want

191
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,460
it you're gonna stretch your skills that
crazy gonna fail a lot and this is gonna

192
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,720
be like a mantra

193
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,150
damn this sucks like I keep failing this
sucks

194
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,660
you're gonna wreck your life you will
literally like that's the part of this

195
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,990
you're gonna wreck your life because the
life you currently have that you want to

196
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,640
not have you won't have anymore is that
makes sense but you will wreck your life

197
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,980
whatever the life is you have right now
will be destroyed by trying to do this

198
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,480
and so some of you will get about two
feet into this you like you know what

199
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,620
I'm good

200
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,040
nevermind i'm gonna go back to my house
now

201
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,040
everything was fine

202
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,910
reason i raised my voice is because in
our house the Blanchard house we have a

203
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,089
thing and it's when someone asks you a
question

204
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:17,030
the way you respond and higher voices is
how untruthful your be it sounds a

205
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,140
little like this

206
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:38,120
so how was your day does this dress make
me stay totally so the one thing that

207
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,340
most of you will probably potentially
discover is that you currently in your

208
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,150
dream job you're gonna go look forward
to going to find like I don't like the

209
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,060
commute for this one job I don't like
this for this job I don't like this for

210
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,589
that and also you're gonna you know what
I have my dream job and when you realize

211
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,710
you do have your dream job you actually
treat the job you currently have

212
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,730
different and then what happens if you
succeed and you get your dream job

213
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:07,040
crap a lot alright so a little bit about
me you know I've kind of started with

214
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,599
these things

215
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:15,139
why are you listening to me i started in
the Army in 1996 I was a combat

216
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:20,150
videographer I made videos for the
United States military i made propaganda

217
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:25,190
films recruitment videos try training
films things like that it was good times

218
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,290
I learned at a very nice trade in the
military that I used and then taught at

219
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,740
full sail university which is a film
school in orlando florida i talk for

like back before YouTube even existed i

225

internet what every girl must watch it

226
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:06,230
was a really generic title it got a
million views in 24 hours before YouTube

227
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,299
the data company called me and said who

255
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,860
Institute as a marketing manager for pen
testing and networks so the one thing I

256
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,689
want you to get at the next couple
slides this please don't be me because

257
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,350
you're not me you work in infosec I work
in marketing and so take the pits and

258
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,678
pieces that work for you and parts that
don't work for you don't so treated like

259
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,190
a buffet if at some point I put out like
a like a really nice brisket and you're

260
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,600
like I like that brisket then you eat
that person you take that first get home

261
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,990
with you like a little to-go container
that's what I'm talking about

262
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:16,970
I so since don't be like me be like you
and i love this i don't know if you've

263
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,880
ever seen its always sunny in
philadelphia but I live my life by this

264
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,990
and I know that's weird honey no I'm
sorry I'm your husband but there are

265
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,760
four kinds of people in this world
there's the looks the brains the

266
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,350
wild-card in the muscle and the reason
why you may not like the job you have

267
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,100
right now is because they are treating
you like the brains when all you want to

268
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:48,230
be the wall card and you want to go find
that wallet card job or you're the wild

269
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,039
card in your job but you really want to
be the looks so what's the difference

270
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,390
the looks as somebody that wants to take
credit they want to lead they want to be

271
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,750
in front of people they want to be the
person who speaks and presents

272
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,830
that's the looks they want that the
brains is the person who is very calmly

273
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,949
sitting behind the scenes making sure
all that architecture and those things

274
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,330
happen then there's the wild-card I love
being the wild-card I'm the one in the

275
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:17,210
meetings that says can we just send like
a billion of them and like Jason we

276
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:23,690
can't send a building about 10,000 yeah
we had some 10,000 20,000

277
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:30,709
it's just like I'm gonna throw out
something we had a guy on our team we

278
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,130
only come when I wanna complex or that
he was the wild-card that was like his

279
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,290
place and so we I'd be things something
he's like that's the stupidest idea what

280
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:44,210
if we just painted purple and like Mike
we can't you know what purple would

281
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,640
actually get a lot of attention

282
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,180
yeah let's be in the purple yeah so
there's the wild-card is so needed and

283
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,690
all organizations are the ones that are
just throwing out those ideas and maybe

284
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,050
that's what you want to be but someone's
got to be in the muscle the muscles

285
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,610
someone that just does to work the grunt
work that the looks takes all the credit

286
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,678
for that the brains is the one that
actually implemented and now the muscles

287
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,830
doing and the wallet cards just like I
don't want to do any work

288
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,320
I just want to throw out crazy ideas all
day that's what I want to do and so the

289
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,500
muscles just this person in some of you
right now we're doing the muscle job but

290
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,610
you're like I want to be the brains so
go find that brings job or you know what

291
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,199
there's some days I just want to make
sandwiches at Subway like I really do

292
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,030
like there are some days where like I am
so tired of doing all these things you

293
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,809
know what I'd like to do just make
sandwiches it's open but I can't because

294
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:41,210
I got golden hanging know that

295
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:47,300
so what's the scope so I'm the next
couple of slides i work in you know I

296
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,980
marketing manager for pen testing and I
hear test methodology all the time so

297
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,540
I'm trying to adapt this talk to pen
test methodologies that way you may be

298
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,159
able to understand it better

299
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,170
so what's the scope i highly encourage
if you're planning to go for your dream

300
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:06,800
job that you put money aside in a budget
because some of the things I'm going to

301
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,129
talk about actually costs money and so
you have to think yourself if I want my

302
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:15,260
next job to be a 40-percent rates or
fifty percent raise or sixty percent

303
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,700
reason what is that

304
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,950
let's say that over the next five years
you're going to make an additional

305
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,660
hundred thousand dollars would you then
invest $5,000 to make an additional

306
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,410
hundred thousand you have to start
thinking about that like what am I going

307
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,030
to invest into myself to be able to do
these things so how much money are you

308
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,030
willing to spend some of that might be
you get on a plane and you go to

309
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,760
somewhere for an interview that maybe
you get on a plane come to dirty

310
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,950
icon this is a part of your investment
and so you flew here to network with

311
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:48,230
people to find those jobs and so put
money aside timeline when do you want to

312
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:54,650
have this job by five years four years
three years next week six years put a

313
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,090
date on it because if you do not put a
date on this it will always be that

314
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,550
thing that you're gonna do like I don't
know there's so many projects around my

315
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,379
house that I haven't gotten to because
i'm going to do them and my wife wants

316
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:23,450
to know when are you going to do them
and like soon so put a date on it like

317
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,390
literally I when I quit my old job and I
went to do this i put a date on the

318
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:34,010
calendar one year from now i'm going to
have this job so do that and the other

319
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,280
reason why that's important is because
some of you are going to leave this talk

320
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,830
we're gonna go out there for 15 minutes
and be totally courageous you're gonna

321
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,860
say all kinds of things and then all the
sudden it's going to be tomorrow and all

322
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,290
the things that you learned over the
weekend and all the beer and everything

323
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,889
else that you drank it all comes
together and all the sudden like we

324
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,620
wanted Jason say dream job now I'm good

325
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:58,850
so put a date down i have this a
philosophy about marketing the keys to

326
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,659
an effective sustained marketing
campaign of these get people to know you

327
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,400
exist right now there's about eight
companies out there that would hire you

328
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,970
I'm i'm just guessing there's eight
companies out there that would hire you

329
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:17,300
with a better wage and better benefits
but they have no idea you exist and

330
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,720
since they don't know you exist they
can't even potentially hire you

331
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,140
so step one is to get people to know you
exist step two is give them a reason to

332
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,740
care

333
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:30,440
just because they know you existed mean
you care i walked down the hall and I

334
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,820
was trying to hand out things to people
I was like why would you like an

335
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,570
advertisement I literally said this I
would you like an advertisement they are

336
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:44,389
like no no no as I was like one
advertisement advertisement one

337
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,110
advertisement

338
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:49,219
yeah and then I walk down the same line
with the same people would you like a

339
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,260
free bag

340
00:26:51,260 --> 00:27:00,379
yeah I'll take a free back exactly
actually find a way to become a free bag

341
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:11,630
and then once they get to know you for
once they know you exist you give me a

342
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,460
reason to care you know like that person
is pretty cool that thing they did that

343
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,350
the tool they came up with that get the
way they want that CTF whatever it is

344
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,879
make sure that you amaze them in some
way and right now here's where that

345
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,250
self-doubt starting to creep in

346
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:36,260
I don't know if I can amaze anyone yeah
you can listen to that voice who are my

347
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,980
target companies let's get into our
reconnaissance their companies out there

348
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,270
that you would love to work for well who
are they make a list of them and I went

349
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,420
through this phase where i wrote down a
list of all the companies i wanted to

350
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,860
work for and then I started finding out
who worked at those companies and then I

351
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,709
started finding out who should i reach
out to those companies and then I

352
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,420
started contacting the people of those
companies and so make a list

353
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,720
there are some companies that will be
really hard to work for because they're

354
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,580
small they're they're cooked close-knit
you need to overcome a huge hurdle to

355
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,050
get into that company but there are the
other companies that aren't and so you

356
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,500
start researching your company's and
seeing what works there are gatekeepers

357
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,540
and these gatekeepers maybe recruiters
or our hiring managers or whoever they

358
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,990
are but you start finding out who are
the gatekeepers that I need to talk to

359
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,400
but how do I figure out this thing you
see with me right

360
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:37,610
I don't have much time for a live demo
but Dave Kennedy and movement here

361
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:43,459
ok the Derby con so one of things that I
do in marketing as i find out why and

362
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,260
who is influential and so what this is
is there becomes twitter account they're

363
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:54,770
following 1061 people so i clicked on
who those 1061 people were and they were

364
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:59,510
these people here and as I was going
through this list i found a company

365
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,340
called

366
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:06,129
Talos I think I said all right Alex
group yes and then I went to tell us

367
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:11,260
page and i looked at Talos and who they
follow and as i was looking at who they

368
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,000
followed i found this guy born in new
york city living the dream in DC career

369
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,799
services manager for talipes well hello
new friend

370
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:28,120
it took like three minutes

371
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:36,279
it really did and then because i'm going
to skip ahead a little bit i run

372
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:44,080
targeted Twitter campaigns where I
target certain ads to certain people so

373
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,539
that way they see it and I'm want to
make sure it's a very my new audience so

374
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:53,350
that way I don't have to spend that much
money and that the ad is relevant and so

375
00:29:53,350 --> 00:30:00,428
what if you ran and add on twitter and
you can look this up and figure it out

376
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:06,100
but you ran an ad on twitter that says
i'm currently seeking employment click

377
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,408
online link head

379
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,799

organization and so you can run in a

380
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,929
targeted twitter campaign against the
people who follow derby khan who follows

381
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:32,289
her become wouldn't you want the people
in this room to see that and so you can

382
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,730
run this for let's say two weeks and it
gets 40 collectors and you you have to

383
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,520
pay three dollars per click through and
now you're at a hundred and twenty

384
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,299
dollars

385
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:44,200
this is why I want you to set some money
aside for your budget to be able to find

386
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,520
these things and so just using simple
twitter now here's what i could do I can

387
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:56,350
also target Talos so Christopher but
then start seeing biad I could target

388
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:01,629
individual companies you can do this on
facebook so quick story i was on

389
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,409
facebook advertising i created a
Facebook page for myself called higher

390
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:11,830
Jason Blanchard I had ad saying hi Jason
Blanchard's that was the title

391
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,490
there's pictures of me hired a simple
answer when you went to the page i

392
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:20,809
treated a facebook page like a resume
when you click on links it took you two

393
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:24,020
projects when you click on link it took
you to a news article about me when you

394
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,679

like it it was a thing that showed you

395
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,419
who I was and then I ran ads targeting
people at certain companies that i

396
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:37,190
wanted to work for and some of those
companies were like Warner Brothers and

397
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:42,080
DC comics and Marvel and sony pictures
and then I could also get really good at

398
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,408
the time I wanted to social media job so
I could target the people who had those

399
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:51,020
job titles and then what happened was I
got a call from a person who had gotten

400
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,889
my name she called me and she's like hey

scent gathering skills and apply to this

409
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,440
not just one quick thing how much ocean
gathering is too much for a potential

410
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:05,029
interviewer yeah i was thinking about
this like imagine you go in for an

411
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:08,179
interview like you've done your research
you've been running your ads targeting

reached out to you you you're now in an
interview and you're sitting down with

414
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:16,159
you know that guy and you go

415
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:25,700
have you thought about getting new
running shoes like I'm sorry what what

416
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:32,480
you put about 500 miles on the shoes you
got right now just wondering if you want

417
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,679
to get new shoes now and have you ever
thought about like running someplace

418
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:48,710
different so you know that's up to you
how weird you want to make that

419
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,340
interview but I guarantee you will be
remembered

420
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,570
hi

421
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:02,389
so what are the skills that you need I i
do recommend going to hiring blogs

422
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:06,289
finding interviewer questions because
you work in a very technical industry

423
00:34:06,289 --> 00:34:10,790
and so you may walk into an interview
and the person says what happens when

424
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:19,159
you go to google.com and you're like the
web site comes up that might not be what

425
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,109
they're looking for they might wanted to
know exactly how that happens and so

426
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:27,469
look at certain interview questions that
you can prepare yourself to walk into

427
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,299
technical interviews

428
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,990
the other thing is develop your skills
let's say you have a three-year goal for

429
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:36,469
this well in the next year you want to
take training and then you want to get a

430
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:39,739
cert but what certain you get this is
that there's a really cool thing that

431
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:44,928
you can do and I don't have the internet
up here to write this down because it's

432
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,840
not in my slides

433
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,850
I work for a company that has very
specialized certifications and each one

434
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:58,990
of those certifications has a very
unique set of letters gih gpe and so if

435
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:04,509
you have one of those search and you go
to LinkedIn and you do a search for that

436
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:10,060
specific certification it will bring up
one every person who has it that way you

437
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:16,330
can do some social gathering to it will
also bring up every job that is

438
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:20,860
currently posted with that certification
that they're looking for

439
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:25,750
so you just type in whatever search you
got it then says here's the 582 jobs

440
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,290
that is requiring that search and you
start going through limiting to a

441
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:35,620
certain area or certain this certain
companies ok CTFs real quick plug for

442
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,190
the holiday hat challenged by every year
comes out have you ever done hollyhock

443
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,360
down version if you're looking for skill
development building the holodeck

444
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,950
challenge is available right now for
last year's and if you do it and you get

445
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,890
stuck somewhere what we've already
finished it so that way you can go to

446
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,980
the write-ups that people have done and
say well this is what I did

447
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,820
so this is a great way to build your
skills for free there's no cost to this

448
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,810
and then there's also the pivot project
that dot org where you can build your

449
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,640
skills for free there as well

450
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:12,970
ok so if you remember anything from this
talk today it's this and I want you what

451
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,970
when I used to teach film school I used
to have all my students repeat this

452
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,569
after me but I'm not going to do that
here derby you don't want anyone I

453
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,880
smealey so here we go

454
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,550
but I used to ask them to say this and
repeat it with me and it was it's what i

455
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,810
tell myself before I i have to go
networking because I say have to because

456
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,670
i don't like it I'm shy

457
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:39,850
I get anxiety and so I I say this to
myself never deny someone else the

458
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:43,299
opportunity to find out how awesome you
are

459
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,930
think about that when you decide

460
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:57,799
when you decide not to walk up to
someone else

461
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:02,390
you're already saying to yourself I'm
not worth their time

462
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:13,790
that's stupid so stop now work at cts we
do the tournament champions here for

463
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,869
four networks and it's the people who
won all over the world so they were in

464
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:22,220
the top five top 10 and their cts all
over the world and they get to come to

465
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,740
DC and play each other

466
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:29,750
it's amazing because there's more
hacking ability and the luncheon that we

467
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,700
have the most nation-states it's
incredible and they all get a chance to

468
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,460
meet each other and talk to each other
network with each other

469
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,830
I've seen a week we did the CTF in
austin last year and the the guy who won

470
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:48,950
with amazing amazing and then at the end
some other guys walked up there like hey

471
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:54,680
who do you work for and I you told him
you're like you want to stay there so no

472
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:01,040
no is it you want to come work for us

473
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:04,640
yes yes I do

474
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:15,080
so start these are good places
immediately training events when you go

475
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,109
to training events like this is kind of
a training event but when you go to

476
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:21,290
other training events meet the other
people there and then recruiters you

477
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,140
know I have some friends in the infosec
industry that when they get an email

478
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:29,540
from a recruiter they may think it's
terrible feeling stupid recruiter

479
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:38,900
reached out to me job doesn't make any
sense stupid recruiter you know what i

480
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,060
would think of a recruiter reached out
to me

481
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,290
well hello new friend

482
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:48,400
I see you've sent me an e-mail today
that doesn't match my skills or

483
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,440
qualifications but let me tell you the
skills and qualifications I do have is

484
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,440
apparently your happening out jobs or
something

485
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:08,170
I almost just missed my mouth you would
seem like it just running down here

486
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,600
yeah it was so close i right there's
this really cool thing on linkedin

487
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,290
called in mail i'm going to go back to
its superfast and the reason why i had

488
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:22,690
Dave's account up is because I'm not
currently linked in with Dave which is

489
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,640
weird i'm gonna have to fix that but
there's a thing here called send David

490
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,970
in mail if you upgrade your LinkedIn
account for a very brief period once

491
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:38,080
again this is a part of your budget to
go off and so you upgrade your LinkedIn

492
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,069
account you can send like 10 emails or
you can pay for an InMail you know what

493
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:49,540
I do when I pay for in males I just send
it to like VP's hiring managers well

494
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,320
hello CEO of this company i'd love to
work for here's an InMail and you can

495
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,090
send it to anyone and it's guaranteed to
get delivered but if they don't respond

496
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:03,220
within seven days you get it back and
there are some times where i would email

497
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,060
like a V because it's like 34 bucks to
send one of these if you want more like

498
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,480
ten dollars to spend on these so it's
kind of expensive but you have to pick

499
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,610
and choose who you want to send these to
but if you find that gatekeeper at that

500
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,030
company that you want to work for you
want to make sure that you introduced

501
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:24,640
yourself then this might be that way to
to make that first interaction but

502
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,080
there's times where it's like a six and
they haven't responded yet and i'm

503
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,910
certain thing wasn't just don't respond
please don't respond because on day

504
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,770
seven I get that credit back and I can
you email someone else so this is a good

505
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:46,030
thing it's also a good caution so that's
a way to use linkedin that way and then

506
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:50,590
i already showed you how to use Twitter
to find influencers are people who that

507
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:54,520
you would want to reach out to their use
a really cool thing have any who you

508
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,790
ever requested like you can do this
through linkedin or whatever

509
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:02,980
you just contact someone at another
company like hey can we grab lunch you

510
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,940
can we grab dinner can we do a happy
hour something you just ask them for a

511
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,760
nerd and it's like an informal interview
where you just sit down you hang out

512
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,900
with them you swap stories and stuff
like that but at the end of that you may

513
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,320
think yourself for want to work for this
company that person is a total jackass

514
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:23,560
or you leave that come you leave that
meeting and I that was really cool i

515
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,090
like the environment that I was and I i
like that so request informal interviews

516
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,600
with people and I I this worked a lot
for me I would just request

517
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,830
hey can we get coffee just meet for like
10 minutes before you go to work and

518
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,029
just say hi

519
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:42,040
alright so what is a good resume looks
like we're in the exploitation phase

520
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:48,190
right now what's a red good resume look
like I i have no idea when i submitted

521
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:53,920
my resume for the company i currently
work for they were like we really like

522
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,940
you but this resumes terrible because I
was always trying to find jobs in

523
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,210
marketing and social media and
production companies in the

524
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,080
entertainment industry and so mine was
tailored for that and so when I came to

525
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:14,290
this to come down with now they're like
in so i was asked do you see the bullets

526
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,640
and what we're looking for

527
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,040
mhm could you just write a thing that
goes with the bullet was a genius

528
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:32,770
why am I never thought of this you want
to know this here's an example you want

529
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:37,780
to know this here's an example you won't
notice here's an example and I thought

530
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,440
it was a really boring resume but i'm
currently working for this company

531
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:47,890
so you know right so when you're sending
this into that hiring manager whoever is

532
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:52,150
going to its the you're really thinking
this like you that's where that social

533
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:55,600
engineer kind of clicks and you're like
could you just click on it could you

534
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,240
click on the link and click on the thing
could you open the email it's not

535
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,080
weaponized I promise totally promise
this time

536
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,960
totally

537
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:11,280
here's a fun thing if you're doing your
your-your-your researching you or if you

538
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,640
find out they have a working fax machine
fax your resume its gonna freak everyone

539
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:27,060
out all the sudden the fax machine turns
on for like the first time in three

540
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:39,900
years and like so locks passing
someone's come in on the fax how does

541
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:46,530
this and here's what your cover letter
should look like it's a sharpie on a

542
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:52,260
plain sheet of paper and it said if you
think I'm this good and I can track you

543
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,990
down way to you see the other ways i can
do it one you're gonna creep them out

544
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:06,270
but to that's the kind of thing they
showed everybody like we got a fax with

545
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,720
a weird sharpie thing

546
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:16,709
alright so couple other things up at
this current how much time to have like

547
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:27,180
one is seven minutes ok so let's say
you're at a conference and I I I didn't

548
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,220
tell dave i was going to do this

549
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,310
did anyone see this in your bag

550
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:38,160
raise your hand if you solve it's not
all of you huh damage again

551
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:44,759
but this right here as a sponsor we're
able to put things in bags i was

552
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,640
wondering if i was someone looking for
work if I could ask Dave hey Dave could

553
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:57,000
i send you a box of resumes with my
picture on one side i'm going to be a

554
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,500
derby con come find me

555
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,360
let's talk about working together on the
other side in to resume how much would

556
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,470
Dave charge for that you know what I'm
thinking right now though next year

557
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:13,500
derby country like 90 resumes in that
bag everything I'm not opening it

558
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:20,280
I'm not so this only works a few times
it doesn't work when everyone does it so

559
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,860
you have to think about what's that
thing for you

560
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,910
I i loved the spinning wheel i have in
my booth I Plinko things like that and I

561
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:32,460
sometimes you walk up and like hey
what's the spinning wheel for my go

562
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,460
it's a social engineering tactic to get
people to come talk to me

563
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:44,670
nice the hotel bar

564
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,190
I have to tell this quick story about
Leonard Nimoy and Jonathan Franks so I i

565
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,030
come from the comic book industry what I
found out over time is that all the

566
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,810
comic creators and and stars from these
old TV shows and everything they would

567
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:02,880
get together in the the bar that we had
the lowest rate that's where the

568
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,120
convention would put everybody and so
they would all need each other because

569
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,819
it would be weird for them to go out
into the town because if they went into

570
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:14,940
town gonna be like yeah so it freaks
them out so they all stay together so I

571
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,480
learned that they all went to that bar
so when I went to the bar I walked in

572
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,730
and there's Leonard Nimoy and jonathan
frakes having lunch and I was like it's

573
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,730
like number one and number one having
lunch together

574
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:32,779
and then later that night like jonathan
frakes is playing like table hockey with

575
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,050
geoff johns I'm like hanging like a nerd

576
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:43,130
where's John sweden miss you that's all
we need at this point so the hotel bar

577
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,760
and you guys mostly already know this
but the only thing about the hotel bars

578
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:53,780
the one drink rule when you are actively
networking i would like you to stick to

579
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,990
a one-drink role and when you have that
one drink

580
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:01,729
you keep it for all times because the
moment it empties someone wants to fill

581
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:06,440
it for you and you might want to fill
for someone else but after seven drinks

582
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:15,200
I remember I remember this one time now
i don't i went up to a very prominent

583
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,339
comic creator the next day and I was
like hey it's great to meet you

584
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:26,150
it's like we talked for a while last
night did we is like you showed me your

585
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,040
tattoo on your back

586
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,600
it's of your business oh my god that's
true

587
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:37,610
oh so that

588
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,200
yeah the one drink room so

589
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,560
I at one point I had higher Jason
Blanchard com

590
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,640
so you can have higher tone so calm and
one that you have all these things about

591
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,810
you you can run remarketing campaigns on
google that if anyone visit that website

592
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:55,320
then you follow them for like the next
six weeks every single website that they

593
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:02,369
go to they keep seeing your face over
and over and oh you can do that in the

594
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:06,930
creepiest way possible i would like you
to create a new email account for

595
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:11,879
searching for jobs and the email should
say something like badass pentester @

596
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:17,220
gmail.com something to that effect that
amazing

597
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:23,609
dfi our forensics analyst at gmail like
put what you're doing in your email

598
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:27,690
address so that way people on instantly
know and then social media already

599
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:30,839
showed you how to run ads so in the
interview process

600
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:34,710
how do you get used to talking to
strangers i recommend talking to

601
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:37,349
strangers

602
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:41,339
the one thing I really do recommend is
if you're looking at getting a job at

603
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:43,560
let's say this is your dream job

604
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:50,069
do not contact them first contact the
company you never ever want to work for

605
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:56,490
first for practice because when you
don't give a damn about working for

606
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:02,700
somebody you're so calm on the phone
like so what do you think about doing in

607
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:08,970
the next five years a lot of things i
have a list

608
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,720
it's very specific let's go through it
but if it's that dream job and it's your

609
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,750
very first call and really so what do
you think about doing it next five years

610
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:31,980
ok alright so to chew through this uh
you have to at some point let's say a

611
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:36,300
three-month check-in what's working
what's not working at the end of this

612
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,690
i'm going to really think hard about
what I did here

613
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:44,430
did this work is a big picture of me if
you can't see this is this effective is

614
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,790
this a good thing so at the end of this
i'm going to take a look at how many of

615
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,339
these got turned in and you still have
time to turn them in

616
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:52,339
that's my one plug for these

617
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:55,460
there's only 62 other people your odds
are pretty damn good

618
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,589
so this right here I'm gonna evaluate it
and you need to evaluate what you're

619
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:03,589
doing doesn't workers it's not work
right

620
00:50:04,219 --> 00:50:09,829
I'm almost done some of you right now
maybe thinking these things you're

621
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:17,059
hesitating like you know what I could do
it but I'm not thinking about you have

622
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:21,170
doubts and fears some of you right now
like I picked the wrong talk right now

623
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:32,569
that guy's a charlatan I spent an hour
in a marketing presentation get that

624
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:36,589
every once in a while I'll go to a
marketing conference and you can't a

625
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:40,819
marketing conference about marketing
given by marketers is the worst thing on

626
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:48,799
the face of the plant you may be feeling
excited overwhelmed some of you were

627
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:51,979
just a pathetic you're like I walked in
feeling this way I'm gonna walk out

628
00:50:51,979 --> 00:50:54,979
feeling this way thanks talking man

629
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:01,789
some of you will leave here really
determined you're like yes I'm gonna get

630
00:51:01,789 --> 00:51:05,509
that damn dream job of the thing it
something right now like already have

631
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:09,410
enough on my plate this is not what I
needed today and some of your just going

632
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:14,118
to say side because i can't do any of
those things so I'm just gonna stay

633
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:21,109
where i'm at that might make you a sad
panda now what happens if you actually

634
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:25,880
get job offers because this it's going
to start happening i have never gotten

635
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:31,160
just one job offer when i'm doing this
and only have two or three and that

636
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,180
sucks

637
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:38,569
it does you're like all these companies
want you like but what's the right one

638
00:51:38,569 --> 00:51:43,308
and so you actually have to think about
that and here's what I love if anyone

639
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,969
offers you a salary I want you to
instantly go and I'd also like bonuses

640
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:57,619
like what do you mean I'm really driven
by incentives if i do better i want you

641
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:01,310
to pay me more but we don't do that for

642
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:12,860
anyone else it's about time you started
so benefits i once they offer you a

643
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:17,900
salary say thank you talk about the
bonuses they may say no or whatever let

644
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,740
us but after they've offered you the
salary then say you know what else i'd

645
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:26,209
like i'd like you to send me to training
at least once a year I want you to send

646
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,870
me to training so i can get better what
i do i want you to pay for the cert to I

647
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:34,040
don't have to worry about that and I
want you to send me to training and I

648
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,279
want you to help me develop my skills
because I know that you're investing in

649
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,280
me as much time investing in here five
days a week

650
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:48,020
countering that's going to be the
scariest thing you ever do and I don't

651
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:53,509
know how to help you through that but
don't turn to drinking because that's

652
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:58,580
not going to be the place you make that
best decision let's make good leader

653
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:04,069
decisions multiple offers are talking
about that kind of here's the best way

654
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:07,100
to decide between two really good job
offers ready

655
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:16,279
flip a coin I'm serious because as soon
as the coin lands you know exactly which

656
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,680
job you actually wanted because i have
an eleven-year-old daughter because I

657
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,580
flipped a coin and that's a story I can
tell you in the hallway

658
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:40,359
yeah

659
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:48,730
I did my last thing is this it's gonna
be whenever you're looking for a job and

660
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:49,989
you already have one

661
00:53:49,989 --> 00:53:55,269
it's weird it's a weird feeling like
just as a human being it's a weird

662
00:53:55,269 --> 00:54:00,368
feeling when it's time to put in your
two weeks notice and and say you know

663
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:01,450
it's been good

664
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:07,419
we had great times you guys kind of
sucked a lot there's anything i would

665
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:13,720
weigh improve but yeah like whatever but
like as you get it still feels weird

666
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:19,029
because when you give your notice there
maybe please don't go

667
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,890
and there's gonna be a part of you that
said if you treated me better

668
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:30,579
we wouldn't even be here right now but
let's say they do come back with a great

669
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:35,859
counter offer and they do and you're
like you know what that's actually I

670
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:39,069
kind of wish you would have offered me
that forty thousand dollars extra like

671
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:43,420
nine months ago and we wouldn't even be
here right now but nice

672
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:48,578
the thing is if you decide to stay most
people if they decide to stay in a job

673
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:53,739
it's so ends with in like six to six
months or a year because it doesn't

674
00:54:53,739 --> 00:54:58,480
change they're still in the same job and
then all that stuff so if you decide to

675
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,049
stay make sure that everyone understands
that things are going to change

676
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:05,920
management is going to change structure
is going to change benefits are going to

677
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,940
teach whatever it is you have a list of
remember that list that you made of your

678
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:19,269
dream job apply that list to what you're
going to do if you stay make sense and

679
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:22,269
with that i'm a time thanks guys

680
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,500
yeah

681
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,210
thanks that was fun
