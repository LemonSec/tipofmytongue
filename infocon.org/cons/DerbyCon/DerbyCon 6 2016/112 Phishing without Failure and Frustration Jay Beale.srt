1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,609
to run official engagement and probably
to run any engagement so this really

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,700
should be simple right fishing is
actually from a technical perspective

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,000
one of the easiest things to do in what
in guardians does you know what we do at

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,330
this conference in terms of penetration
testing and red teaming in all the

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,799
different kinds of security things
really easy to make a make a crafty

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,849
email that doesn't involve any Nigerian
Prince's that tries to get someone to go

7
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,630
to a website you build a 14 website too

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,339
I don't say maybe collect credentials or
give somebody malware get some malware

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,910
put on your computer you get your client
to your boss to approve of that website

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,148
and that email you send email those many
people as you can you watch the

11
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,780
passwords fly-in and sometimes you get
so you get lucky and it really is this

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,020
easy you can expect about somewhere
between 10 and forty percent of the

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,149
people that you send a good email to to
give you their password and i gotta say

14
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,930
it's a wonderful feeling just watching
the passwords kind of fly in at first

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,040
and then trickle in overtime and you're
like this is great why I spent all this

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,700
time on home ability research and all
this i can i can just get access

17
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,639
um and you know to that end one of my
colleagues Larry Page she once had a

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,570
fishing campaign with the success rate
in excess of a hundred percent the and

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,850
the deal was the company targeted a just
a small subset of its employees and his

20
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,669
old action his give us your password or
cutting your access off and you're gonna

21
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,750
get fired and the brothers gonna burn
down and it's all gonna be your fault

22
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,640
that back hold action scared the crap
out of them well enough that uh that

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,329
they not only gave them their props
where they formed around to other people

24
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,570
who haven't gotten the email they went
according to their other email accounts

25
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,298
and they sent it to like those
privileged separate accounts one that

26
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,479
didn't get email but like almighty a
counter don't want my domain admin

27
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:04,950
account to get caught off and and so he
did greater than a hundred percent so so

28
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,330
i'm going to talk about going to talk
about kind of why we fish and then

29
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,650
to tell you about alvin all the ways
it's gone wrong for us or for people we

30
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,190
know

31
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,280
yeah I'd like to save face and say
whenever this happens that my own

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,680
company this is all stuff that happened
somewhere else

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,200
so why do you fish in the first place of
the official engagement should make it

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,970
so that everybody individually gets
better at spotting fishing at spotting

35
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,490
official email and not getting and so
they don't get tricked by it um it

36
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,940
should increase every person individuals
resilience but you're going to find out

37
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,120
later in this talk it should also make
the whole organization better at

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
figuring out what's going on and
communicating it to everybody else and

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,880
very very quickly as a group detecting
you and causing you to fail so the cool

40
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,180
thing is after you do this a couple
times the employees of companies tend to

41
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,260
get better

42
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,730
yeah and no reported higher percentages
and we'll talk about that so so

43
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,200
officials this simple and if it's really
obvious why we should do it then why am

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,089
i giving a talk of like I didn't want to
speak at Derby con but there was more

45
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,990
than that and this is this talk is one
that honestly we give inside our own

46
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,239
company that we the we kind of keep
passing on this kind of knowledge that

47
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,709
we've gained and also we don't make
quite the same mistakes so most people's

48
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:26,570
first few attempts they don't go this
well and and is how when I'm you know

49
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,620
I'm one of the owners over in guardians
and I would watch person after person

50
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:36,440
get assigned to official engagement and
gets so frustrated with what the clients

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,800
were asking for how the clients were
getting in their way or how is taking

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,580
longer than it should and and that
frustration after a while you're like

53
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,860
okay we've got to figure out what we can
do that were not frustrated in our jobs

54
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,410
that were feeling great about what we
did

55
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,950
we're feeling great about it we're
having great success and and we're

56
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,660
enjoying our work so the rest of this
talk is basically looking at frustrating

57
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,070
situations we've had and try to teach
you how to avoid them entirely and

58
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:09,560
achieve greater success so here's a
quick summary one of things I want to

59
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,799
say is this isn't about this isn't
really strictly about red team fishing

60
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,190
we do that too and you'll tend to

61
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,160
into these challenges quite so much
because it's a different beast and I'll

62
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,150
talk about that here and there so 12
stories of failure with our specific

63
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,320
solutions and you're gonna see me get
into some themes and it's basically that

64
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,099
if you're setting up any professional
fishing campaign you're going to end up

65
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,150
in communication you're going to end up
collaborating and you're gonna end up

66
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,440
negotiating and the more you do those
three things the better your it goes

67
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,740
actually it turns out this is really
useful for all the kinds of engagements

68
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,430
we do in our work and if you're not
liking your it and you're not

69
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,180
consultants you're going to find its
exact same way for you with this stuff

70
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,400
it's going to be well it turns out your
client is basically your boss or your

71
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,020
organization uh you know your your
client is the part of the people you're

72
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,700
trying to help though your client
contact is basically your boss whoever

73
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,830
owns this project above you

74
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,010
i'm going to talk and I'm going to going
to talk about these three things

75
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:14,650
collaboration communication and
negotiation a bunch as we go through one

76
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,729
of the things i want you to get from
this is that anything in life that

77
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,320
involves more than one person any
conversation any well not even spoken

78
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,099
but any anything in life involve more
than one person involved negotiation

79
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,020
it's often not negotiation you you're
even conscious too but i'm basically in

80
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,099
one right now with all of you right i'm
i'm asking you to stay

81
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,940
i'm making a bid not just for you to
stay in the room but i'm making a bit

82
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,690
for your attention and that's the
negotiations happening here will come

83
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:50,169
we'll come back to that theme so I do
want to say real quick that uh this talk

84
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,180
is basically about penetration testing
fishing fishing engagements in this are

85
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,000
trying to hit the entire organization

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,150
we're trying to find out how every
single person as many people as possible

87
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,909
response will tell you about the
organization as a whole

88
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,940
we're trying to measure something we're
trying to make you better and we're

89
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,390
trying to make everybody better
resisting so that's what we call a

90
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,860
penetration test fish in a red team
situation and you'll notice the golden

91
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,590
gardens folks around the conference
you're going to start you know now that

92
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:23,530
I pointed out you're going to see all of
the big logos um we are doing we also do

93
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,179
red team

94
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,960
working in the red teaming work you're
looking for much smaller target pole

95
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,620
you're gonna send one or two emails
maybe ten the most but you're sending a

96
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,030
few emails as few phishing emails as it
takes to get access you're going to

97
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,359
manually determine who it is that you're
gonna be targeting you're going to be

98
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,360
using some of the open-source
reconnaissance tools out there might be

99
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,830
as simple as LinkedIn or connect kamar
looking at the company's website and you

100
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,070
end up being really really targeted
you're focused on a roll you're gonna be

101
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,270
sending you've got a word macro deliver
you're going to be sending it to someone

102
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,198
in HR who looks at resumes all the time
is quite used to opening every word

103
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:06,960
document their scent so okay let's go 12
stories uh let's see I'm going to keep

104
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,770
saying you're gonna hear me say or going
to hear you say client you're gonna hear

105
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,469
me say target all three of these are
synonymous

106
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,690
so if you are my perspective is you know
it's bad more than 13 or 14 years as a

107
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,430
consultant outside of an organization if
you're inside an organization you work

108
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,160
for that organization they're you're
client i think we talked about that a

109
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,250
little bit already so let's get right
into it

110
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,110
story number one scheduled failing in in
our work when we're an outside party

111
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,050
schedules really important it's
important to us to show that we can

112
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,159
deliver on time

113
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:41,460
it's important to us to make the
economics work like hey I've got

114
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,698
something to do like this week I'm gonna
be fishing you next week will be writing

115
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,930
a report the week after that I'm onto
another time if I haven't finished

116
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,220
writing reward if I ran late anywhere in
there I'm workin nights I don't want to

117
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,300
do that so schedules really important us
here's what a fish

118
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,750
here's what more than one of our early
fish engagements would look like

119
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,889
so monday we go to the client we give
them three scenarios three stands to

120
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,960
choose from right three of the nigerian
prince or the hey we need to reset your

121
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,130
password please type it in here and so
on these pretexts so give them three

122
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:19,620
scenarios they choose one so we spend
Tuesday we're building the pretext we're

123
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,570
sending the we send the emails and
landing page screenshots the client the

124
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,620
client says hey could you change this
wording here and can you make this a

125
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,990
little less tricky here or what have you

126
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,310
so we make a change on wednesday the
client approves the email when page

127
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:39,089
text and we're like okay we're gonna
take it easy on Friday we're gonna be

128
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,760
sending those emails for the whole
schedule to work on friday gonna be

129
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,480
sending emails so we can spend Thursday
kind of starting to rewrite the report

130
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,580
and then we get to Thursday and the
client just things magic show this is my

131
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,330
boss already the clients boss comes by
and asks like hey I heard you got this

132
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,650
fishing thing going on

133
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,800
you show me what you guys are going to
do and he's like oh I totally forgot to

134
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,680
show it to you here here it is and the
boss says no right and and says you

135
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,209
can't do that you know you just and and
for whatever reason the clients boss

136
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,800
scared of your pretext like you you
can't send out something that says that

137
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,579
it's from the company presidents you
know from now on no legal process

138
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,690
development company's presence and so
what happens to us well we're with to

139
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,950
restart from from day one so we're on
thursday we think we're sending emails

140
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,760
tomorrow and instead we're having
conversations inside of how we have to

141
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,089
change the schedule we're going to
another we are ready another three days

142
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,110
we're going to come up with new things
this early on with the point where

143
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,250
everyone starts getting mad at the
clients and Matt the client frustrated

144
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,360
recliner pressure with the people around
you is just not a place a lot of power

145
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,820
and control in your work and it sucks
this so so that's where we start saying

146
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,070
okay what can we do to fix that and the
first picks for this is step and leads

147
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,900
son right

148
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:03,360
ok so you've got a lead you basically
have to leave your organization through

149
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,600
the process from the beginning and that
means you've got to tell them what

150
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,800
you're going to need to do before you
even start brainstorming pretexts you're

151
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,859
going to basically say okay I mean like
we did a bunch of these and finally I i

152
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,150
gave this a try

153
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,569
ok so this was one of the places I had a
bunch of failure and I'd like like when

154
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,800
the clients that ok this is our process
we are going to on this day give you

155
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,609
some pretext choices you're going to
tell us what you like and what you don't

156
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,940
like we're going to do an edit we're
going to get ready for another round of

157
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,170
edits and so on you're going to show
this to people as early in the process

158
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,520
as we can and so on so part of that
meant i told them at you know it's part

159
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,439
of this like you have tell me on day 0
tell me before we even start giving you

160
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,260
pretext ideas tell me who it is that can
veto that great

161
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,610
text and I want to tell them like i want
to say tell me who can veto but i also

162
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,720
wanted to be important as important the
client is as it is to me so I want to

163
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,030
tell them the story of like what happens
when we get a later stage like that we

164
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,140
have that monday through thursday start
over thing and that story is really

165
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,949
really helpful

166
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,760
now i need to set deadlines and tell
everybody when they have to when they

167
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,220
have to accept the pretext by if they
want this tall finish on time and the

168
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,030
next part for me is I'm going to protect
the pretext sometime i'm not going to do

169
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:23,530
all the work to build a very dynamic
website and all that until I've gotten

170
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,390
to say okay on the first part um what
else can I do i can actually involve the

171
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,910
client and maybe that boss might veto in
creating those pre-tax and if I involve

172
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,180
them there's a hacker watching a couple
left lot less chance they're going to

173
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,300
object the last minute because they were
involved in the beginning and if they

174
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,719
thought of somebody who might object
they might involve them you get pretty

175
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,890
why you get you start realizing that
there are more people involved in just

176
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,710
the two people that are on the phone
when you call your client contact you

177
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:56,290
call your boss so the last part for me
is realized in negotiation and now

178
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,530
rocket accordingly realize it's a
multi-party negotiation not all the

179
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,790
parties are here

180
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,300
what do you want to do about that you
want to get them on the call to you want

181
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,170
to meet with them you want to say okay
let's get this

182
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,370
let's get the set of people who can veto
down its it's this is the great thing

183
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,730
about any engagement whether it's a you
know whether you're inside or outside

184
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,850
company you basically can say this is
how it's going to go and by saying that

185
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,830
early arm everyone starts following the
plan and if anyone's like that's not

186
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,570
going to work you get that conversation
happen early and now you change the plan

187
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,820
and everything goes a heck of a lot
better but when you then afterwards so I

188
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,750
want to say the other the other part of
this for me is just realizing that

189
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,890
anything you do is about leadership
doesn't matter what your position is

190
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:50,140
even the lowest person on the totem pole
in your group and if a project belongs

191
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,520
to you you've got a lead

192
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,280
you've got a lead that project you've
got to lead anybody who's involved in

193
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,800
that

194
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,390
and you can read books on managing up
and managing laterally but you have to

195
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,980
lead someone has to stand up and lead
and that's your job if you don't do it

196
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,970
someone else will stand up and they may
not know this area much as you or they

197
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,430
may not care about it as much as year
the other big is basically you think

198
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,790
through what the plan is you try to
you're gonna you're going to see a bunch

199
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,140
of our mistakes these can be really
useful think through what could go wrong

200
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,610
beforehand and figure out how you're
going to account for it i'm going to

201
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,240
tell you I'm telling you 12 things that
have gone wrong for us and what we did

202
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,050
you can kind of do this thought exercise
other than playing out real life the way

203
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,029
i did so the other part is described
your plan do it with confidence that

204
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:41,540
that confident voice tells everyone like
yeah I thought this through

205
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,880
I know what I'm doing but then at the
same time that can bolt people bet that

206
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,050
like I thought this through this is the
plan involve people over you have to

207
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,939
listen you have to ask people like we're
missing anything anybody like you have

208
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,600
to basically encourage objections and
then when those come up

209
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,649
don't miss tiny just be ready to
negotiate and get creative and we'll

210
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,220
talk about that some more short version
for us one of things that we've learned

211
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,740
that we've learned in guardians now in
our work is if we communicate more in

212
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,829
general if we communicate more in the
beginning will spend a lot less time

213
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:19,279
having to communicate the way we don't
like talking about our frustrations

214
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,450
about how it didn't were saying it's not
my fault that someone else's fault and

215
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,920
and just overall being upset things
didn't go as well as we like anybody

216
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,770
have anything in their work that didn't
go as well as they like they kind of

217
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,670
regret it just want to make sure it's
not just me because if I'm the only one

218
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,110
then like well okay this is still fun i
can tell you all my files but you know

219
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:47,630
ok so story to you spend a whole bunch
of time making your blue your laptop

220
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,560
fall off the podium so you spend a whole
bunch of time developing that prototype

221
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,079
that that are free text email and
landing page and send all emails and

222
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,839
they all get stuck in the spam filters
nobody gets them

223
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,690
and it's too late to do anything about
it of and this sucks so maybe this

224
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,220
painful these triggers domains to New
maybe they trigger because you got you

225
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,550
know a broken configurations on SPF 4d
camera or the you know general MTA so

226
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,400
things just look fishy in the same way
that they look fisherman's family

227
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,230
sending stuff so the tough part is again
schedule fail back to the drawing board

228
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:31,650
your schedule suffers your your clients
annoyed or your bosses annoyed your kind

229
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,069
of frustrated and kind of lost a little
bit of credibility

230
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:39,150
ok so what do you do for this there are
technical fixes on the technical side

231
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:45,990
spfd chem ta think through like wait a
second is this box in ipv6 on if it does

232
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,760
make sure that make sure that the make
sure that your SPF record has the ipv6

233
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,189
right that's the technical part though
the human parts a lot more powerful here

234
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:02,160
and that is you talk to your client or
and you say listen we're not testing the

235
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,360
anti-spam or anti-malware anti-phishing
whenever we're testing the technical

236
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,560
controls here let's talk about what the
goal of the work is and honestly anytime

237
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,500
you're negotiating let's you're
basically saying like what's your

238
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:19,140
overall goal and how do we best achieve
it so our overall goal is to get an

239
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,650
email in everybody's hands and figure
out whether they figure they get fooled

240
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,300
by it and afterwards to learn from that
and make it so that they get fooled by

241
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,060
these things less so how about if we
about if we just get whitelisted in this

242
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,560
in the spam filters and that's basically
we do every time right listen span

243
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,219
vocals if you want to know what would
get through we can do something about

244
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,570
that later on

245
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,560
um what's the other part of its think
about what could go wrong hey if they're

246
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,410
gonna put whitelisting place you're
going to make sure the way listing

247
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,310
actually did get put in place so leave
time in your schedule for to take a

248
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:57,329
little while leave time in your schedule
to test and make sure in that when you

249
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,170
stand up and leave and say what the plan
is make sure the plan involves then

250
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,560
setting it up and tell you what it is
and you testing externally before you

251
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,589
send all the males because we've had
that we're like you're waitlisted

252
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,138
and you send all the emails through and
they all get flagged and now this band

253
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:15,250
filters are trained on those and you're
like what happened like oh the waitlist

254
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,579
wasn't in place yet sorry we didn't
realize like sorry

255
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:27,428
so you get a better plan ok so story 3i
use all the best tools i use multi go I

256
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,929
i I'd like learned everything about OS
since i'm looking for email addresses

257
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:36,309
and at the end of the day i only get 15
email addresses that actually work but

258
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:39,129
my goal was to test the organization as
a whole and I'm gonna need a heck of a

259
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:44,289
lot more email addresses in 15 right I
need all of them already at least enough

260
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:48,250
that i'm going to be able to take a real
measurement and it's not fair right so

261
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,799
as a sudden you can't break the law

262
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,080
I don't get to do you know or can't
break my can't break my clients your

263
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,870
email infrastructure I don't get to do
the same thing they do i'm not gonna buy

264
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,008
mailing lists

265
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:03,309
I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna
hack machines and getting all the

266
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:07,418
dresses that way i'm not going to do
something that one of our guys may or

267
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,860
may not have no no none of our guys with
this but Bob this guy I know named Bob

268
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,820
might have at some point you know been
working on a doing fishing exercise

269
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,980
against the hospital and setup and
sniffed all their printer driver and got

270
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,360
email addresses out of the pagers so no
that's that's that's not something I

271
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,299
would do but the bad guys get to do that
we don't

272
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:33,668
so what do you do about that let's just
stipulate like right but you know if

273
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:36,700
your lawyers and court and talk about
stimulating something so let's just

274
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,659
stipulate the people that any attacker
could get a very comprehensive list of

275
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:44,080
email addresses they could root force
the mail servers they could do that very

276
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,830
slowly over the course of a year until
they've gotten every possible email

277
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,320
address that will work in your
organization at least the ones that are

278
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,639
the characters or less

279
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:55,269
so at this point realize I'm gonna
negotiate with the client maybe the

280
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:59,590
client says damn it I you know I really
wanted to really want this to be

281
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:04,149
realistic i wanted to know how many
email addresses you could get like okay

282
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:09,279
how about this will find all the email
addresses we can get you might be 15 it

283
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,840
might be four hundred and let's make
part of the plan that once i give you

284
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,908
those email addresses in exchange

285
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,690
you're going to give me is the complete
set of email addresses will fish with

286
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,799
please send email addresses and you'll
know you'll know what would have

287
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,559
happened if we had that we have less
complete set

288
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,789
you look at the results without the with
using only the email addresses we got so

289
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:34,269
we both get to achieve our goal my
clients to find out what email address i

290
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:37,509
could find he gets to have that realism
and you can even see the report

291
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,620
structured that way and i get to get
what I wanted which was in my mind the

292
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,969
goal was passed every single person
organization are you seeing like kind of

293
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,659
like that kind of trick that's another
part of just negotiating i'm getting

294
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:54,340
creative what is my client my client
says nowhere keep it like that and early

295
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,110
on what would happen what would happen
in my work is we say ok the client said

296
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,860
we had to do it that way and we feel
kind of stock and would be annoyed of

297
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,090
our clients a client didn't get it right
but that complaint is no fun

298
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,440
what's fun is figuring out something
creative and find a way around it and

299
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,309
getting the client what they saw giving
the client we know they need and having

300
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:16,928
everybody win

301
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:22,779
ok next story um I love this one I did
this one of the email says that it's

302
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:27,759
from Dave Kennedy of at our client
organization and so the the email says

303
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,450
this is the IT director David Kennedy I
need you all to send me your password

304
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,690
you know please no please click this
link and give me your password

305
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:39,580
what happened well my target
organization they turned out they sit in

306
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,769
a really big one story

307
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:45,730
floorplan I visited later and found out
that's how the seating work I didn't

308
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,269
know that's how it works but until we
got our next task and internal sense

309
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,220
when we realize they're all on one floor

310
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,769
it's like a big aircraft hangar of desks
it was it was kind of ugly an awful but

311
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:01,269
but it did have one advantage and that
was that ever going to basically see day

312
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:04,330
where they could see somebody you could
see Dave when they just people start

313
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,779
walking over until they've basically I
pulled out the walmart night and said

314
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:14,500
this is dave that email is not for me
don't give me your password which is all

315
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,759
okay see this is why I danced to the
joke you don't left

316
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,850
so so anyway this all goes badly for
success rate plummets so how do you will

317
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,230
always the pics for this

318
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,400
okay well from now on we find out we
will learn a little bit more about where

319
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,320
everybody says so I want to learn where
they said how do they communicate what's

320
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,100
the escalation procedure what's what's
going to happen when the first person

321
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,189
who realizes this is a scam finds out

322
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,970
are they are they going to call are they
going to call the helpdesk if they're

323
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,460
going to call the helpdesk maybe I need
to get the helpdesk involved and say hey

324
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,810
guys can you give us a pass on this one
this one is this one is your partner

325
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:58,159
this is the visit internal thing or this
is you know where were your pen test

326
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,740
partner um I want to make another part
of that though is can I get more people

327
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,810
involved and brings coming the pretext

328
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,950
can I have better communication so I
have my boss or my clients and maybe one

329
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,430
level of management above them involved
in creating that pretext and when they

330
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:17,690
go and check that pretext and say hey go
check that you know go discuss this with

331
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,400
HR disgusted with legal votes discuss
with compliance let's figure out of Jack

332
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:31,490
could be part of the alert chain so uh
next fail my client says hey you i want

333
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,120
to send these emails nice and slow
because i want to avoid detection

334
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,770
so you're like okay yeah we'll send one
every five minutes and by the time

335
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:44,000
you've sent out 10 almost an hour has
gone by someone alerted the security

336
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,690
folks the help desk or whatever they
send out a mass email the whole

337
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,400
organization has caught you

338
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,790
the jig is up sure low and slow was not
sneaky turned out low and slow was very

339
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,030
very unsteady I need to go on a heck of
a lot faster

340
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:03,830
um I do like this though the
organization caught me right they caught

341
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,220
me by all talking to each other I what
they weren't just relying on each one

342
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,210
person can scan that's not what i was
trying to measure but it was a really

343
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,470
cool results find and that's part of
what i like about fishing is that you

344
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,740
end up getting to find out you get you
end up getting to improve that

345
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,310
so as far as I'm concerned it's all
about speed it's all about speed and you

346
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,210
should take as much speed as you know of
this is not about amphetamines

347
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,309
ok so

348
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:32,379
fishing is all about speed you have to
rush take whatever legal impediments you

349
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:34,870
have to do so let's go for coffee

350
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,370
you're racing their ability to catch you
as a group to communicate and

351
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,330
collaborate so realize the communication
collaboration this talk is happening on

352
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:48,970
all sides of make sure that your email
gives such a short deadline that people

353
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,610
are rushing but they're not getting a
chance to think and see

354
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,439
wait why would Dave need my password was
reset academy or whatever like don't

355
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:04,149
give them time to talk get the emails
out as fast as you can okay next fail we

356
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:08,379
have a case where you're like you know
this is your first mission exercise and

357
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:13,299
and you do what you've always right
about the books and your domain is lines

358
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:18,700
domain with the l change to one or with
one of the elves pulled out right that's

359
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,940
the kind of like yeah I can get that
domain and get a certificate certain the

360
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,600
domain everyone's gonna fool and then
you realize what we realized really

361
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,529
quickly

362
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:29,980
this is the one thing that everybody's
really well-trained that they're looking

363
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,929
to see is the domain just like ours but
a little different and so no none of

364
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:35,980
them are rules

365
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,940
well okay a few still get fooled anyway
you always get somebody that's great i

366
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,019
love fishing

367
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:46,269
um but not enough of them are fool you
need a better domain choice so here's

368
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:50,710
some of the ideas that we've had we've
done things like said you know and I've

369
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,460
got I've got a sum of people in this
room who actually you know steered us in

370
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:00,100
this direction like haha maybe its
clients pipe and benefits . com that

371
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:05,289
sounds good enough maybe it's a
sub-domain we have like clients name .

372
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:09,100
you know my health benefits shit that I
just ruin whatever domains

373
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:15,399
okay well please don't black list these
domains there we like them up so you

374
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:19,809
know figure out what will work and part
of figuring out what a work is talk to

375
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:23,320
your client will talk about that and
they'll also have the best ideas for

376
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,509
pretexts they've been hoping for this
for a long time but also going to talk

377
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:32,019
to your colleagues like I'm gonna go and
say hey John I was thinking about you to

378
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:35,180
me like Lily with 1l change on be like
to

379
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,610
I've been there done that it doesn't
work it doesn't work bad don't even like

380
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,780
how about what if you tried this and you
collaborate and you get much better

381
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,440
results

382
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,890
that's honestly one of the strongest
things and gardens whenever one of our

383
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,220
greatest friends and guardians is that
we're all talking as we're working the

384
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,120
world helping each other out we're all
learning from each other and and it

385
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:04,040
makes us much much stronger so so here's
so what if in that story right now where

386
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,540
I chose the boneheaded domain and eli
lilly with with 1l change what if it's

387
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,220
the client who asked for that

388
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,150
what if the clients and just ask where
they told you had to write like we've

389
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,420
all had that experience where we think
we have no choice

390
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:22,070
the boss just said we have to do this
maybe the Boston mean it quite that way

391
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:27,290
maybe he did but we want to take it that
way so this is where i'll come back to

392
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:31,250
my theme that the fishing is about
collaborating and communicating

393
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:37,220
negotiating the easiest way to lose out
in a negotiation is to not realize

394
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,180
you're in one

395
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:43,940
ok sure the client said you had used
that domain can you talk and say that

396
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,100
I'm really worried that might not work

397
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,209
you kind of reveal your own concerns and
do it in a way that your client can get

398
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,140
with empathize with I'm really worried
that's not gonna work and i'm going to

399
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,520
give you a false sense of security or
you know I'm gonna get laughed at you're

400
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,970
gonna get lapped at people are going to
think that we did a good job and if they

401
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,240
still don't see it say okay I tell you I
can we just get a couple more people

402
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,860
from you know we get a couple of more of
your years you know or your boss's boss

403
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,370
being on this conversation so we you
know so we can just check this out and

404
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,889
let somebody else say it's a brain-dead
idea

405
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:22,460
okay uh next story broken grammar we
have this we've gotten this one a lot

406
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,990
this is one of the biggest things that's
ever frustrated of our people is when

407
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,820
you're is when the client says hey I
want to use broken grammar and bad

408
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,730
spelling because that's I get tons of
these phishing emails we always have

409
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,730
broken grammar and bad spelling and I
want this to be realistic

410
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:42,770
ok if you go with it you're going to be
your your success rates going to plumb

411
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,269
it you're going to feel frustrated

412
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:48,529
you know that it wasn't realistic the
problem at the end of that is that your

413
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:52,489
client has your client has basically
given his company a false sense of

414
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:56,239
security and you did it because you felt
like you had to

415
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:00,379
ok so your client was a negotiation you
were negotiating with your client you

416
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,889
didn't realize your association your
client one the negotiation and by

417
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:10,099
winning it really he lost so this is my
you know first rule of negotiation if

418
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:14,809
anybody losses everybody loses this is
similar to the the play or movie Chicago

419
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:20,029
right mom ain't happy ain't nobody happy
my corollary to that that's when it's

420
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:25,579
going to stop me my corollary to that is
if anybody in happy ain't nobody happy

421
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:29,809
we all know this from our families right
things have anybody unhappy and your

422
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:34,249
family without everybody basically being
like please not for any length of time

423
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:40,279
so so what do you do you get creative
you tell you tell your client liked how

424
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,239
the broken after the heartbroken grammar
is going to hard it is not going to

425
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:48,649
harden them against Fisher's who do
right well if I don't believe you

426
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:51,829
this is about realism for them maybe you
go and find a phishing email that you

427
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:56,539
received that had good grammar and good
spelling it was pretty dark convincing

428
00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:00,739
maybe when you asked quietly pulled by
was like oh yeah that did happen me once

429
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,429
like okay you remember that one that's
what we're aiming for and now you've got

430
00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:10,099
somebody on board with you now if you're
still stock get right again realize

431
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:14,418
you're negotiating it's not just it's
not just that one person's idea has to

432
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,609
win and you find something we both win

433
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:20,928
so you could say tell you what I'll do
one round of fishing maybe against half

434
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:25,579
the organization that has broken grammar
and one round that has not broken

435
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:29,658
grammar and we'll get to see what you
know we'll get to see the difference and

436
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:32,659
we'll get we'll both get the data that
we were looking for

437
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:37,279
ok so keep checking my time

438
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:42,739
ok good so the story eight and this one
may or may not happen recently it was

439
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,549
kind of fun the the client client comes
to us we hate when this happens

440
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:52,158
courthouse listen only me and my boss
know that this is happening at all

441
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,890
we've never told anybody planning fish
were just fishing ourselves

442
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:03,150
okay and I whenever anybody says I'm
like no of right so so what happened was

443
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:06,720
one time we did that nobody else gonna
hear we're like but we really should

444
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,380
involve legal and and if you guys have
compliance involve them maybe tell the

445
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:16,200
helpdesk about like no one's gonna know
and and so we said okay fine we sent out

446
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,610
phishing emails and other client holding
for guard and the investigation got

447
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,240
opens and a whole bunch of us got egg on
our face

448
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,100
this is happened with other
organizations be so I didn't regard but

449
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,020
I'm uh I'm not going to go into that so
what do you do to avoid this situation

450
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:39,780
right first you have to leave you have
to stay you have to basically be very

451
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,210
very confident you have to know that
you're the one that's got the experience

452
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,680
or you're the one that cares about this
the most or what have you but you have

453
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,700
to stand up and lead and you have to say
just honestly it's part of my checklist

454
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,650
as I'm taking a client through what
we're going to do

455
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:58,050
it's like and here's the stage where you
tell HR legal and so on about the test

456
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:03,060
um and I make brainstorming who those
people are part of setting up for this

457
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,910
the other thing i do is tell stories
humans were optimized for storing it

458
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,690
turns out that if I tell you a story
with 20 plotlines you can repeat them

459
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:17,100
back to me in order and you can pass
that along and it will still come out in

460
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,480
order where our brains for one reason or
another evolved for stories you can't do

461
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,220
the same thing necessarily the 22 not
digit number okay he can but the rest of

462
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,300
us probably can't

463
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:32,730
ok at least I can handle of the recipe
ok so what are the other parts you have

464
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,050
to know the client know the target right
know your target is the way the military

465
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:41,040
talks about this look at what are the
escalation paths and where do I want to

466
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,220
set my break points so it's going to go
to help desk and I want to clue them in

467
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,500
but helpdesk is going to go to security
next

468
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,750
cool let's make sure Security's part of
this ok next story the client called you

469
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:56,730
hourly for results the fishing exercise
going out two days and every hour on the

470
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,940
hour you get another call from a client
and it's driving you nuts

471
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,890
I kinda like that many calls from people
I'm really

472
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,300
social but let's just assume you're
introverted of so what do you do

473
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:12,159
this is where you manage expectations
this is a you keep that level of effort

474
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,180
under control

475
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,820
this is part of you have to lead you say
early on when the what when we started

476
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,810
fishing i'm going to call you every 15
minutes for the first hour after that

477
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,440
we're going to talk twice that day we're
gonna talk twice the next day and if the

478
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,700
clients like I really wish you know at
that point what you're going to say it's

479
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,990
strongly and now you you can't shut down
the conversation you've got to basically

480
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,980
something to figure out how that felt
the other person and say okay how did

481
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,790
that feel

482
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,970
and they're like really but that sounds
good but at the beginning I really wish

483
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,480
like you could give me those instead of
every 15 minutes how about hourly for

484
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,920
the first four hours like same amount of
communication that's what works better

485
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,790
for you

486
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:56,590
I can deal with that sounds great and so
you basically have to leave and then you

487
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:03,459
have to listen okay so story 10 where 10
through 10 out of 12 I like the way this

488
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:08,770
is going so your campaign is successful
you've got tons of passwords you want it

489
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,180
I wonder if I got that on camera and it
wasn't looking for it without a license

490
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,790
can I fake it but i can fake that one
when you get that again you rock

491
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:30,040
we said that to me i'm negotiating he's
not even using words but i'm watching

492
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,020
his face and watching his actions

493
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,740
it's going to work out better I mean
maybe he's like no I'm not gonna forget

494
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,460
to send that to you or I'm gonna take
that picture but if it didn't ask i

495
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,450
don't get to find out if that's a
possibility and that's really good for

496
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,720
getting cool pictures of conferences
it's also really cool for making your

497
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,890
professional life from your personal
life work so in this situation your

498
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,560
campaign successful but your client
doesn't feel like you're communicating

499
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,280
enough they didn't they didn't score
this used to say this as they didn't

500
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,889
feel the love you got to make him feel
loved

501
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:04,210
so maybe they thought you didn't care or
maybe Steve it was worse than that maybe

502
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,240
because you weren't communicating very
much with them when something bad

503
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,980
happens when management freak tower or
when employees got went nuts they didn't

504
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,530
feel like they could call you would ask
for help

505
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,620
where they didn't call you and ask for
help because they didn't feel like you

506
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,679
know they're just like much
communication going on and so then

507
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,489
things go badly the organization is
going to fish again for years and you

508
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:27,250
could have done something about that but
could only do something about that if

509
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,790
you were in conversation with them if
you kind of built up that that rapport

510
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:35,350
that conversation that trust that when
something went bad the client instead of

511
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,409
being mad at you comes to you and says
hey this is what's going on and you're

512
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,649
like oh hey we've done this before I
would do this

513
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:48,340
ok so success and a happy client your
ears we do that remember most of all

514
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,390
like empathy remember that your security
people over their client they've been

515
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:56,589
rooting for this for a long time they've
been wanting an exercise like this for a

516
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,300
long time before they got it

517
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,170
um another part is making me feel loved
given stats really often during the

518
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,740
first day have that conversation about
how often you're going to here's another

519
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,529
one and I had talked about this a little
bit communicate more

520
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:13,720
yeah we all know more but we also want
to know how much and how and the cool

521
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,870
thing is you can ask i can ask my client
what do you want in terms of

522
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,960
communication i was thinking this could
be like well that sounds kind of good

523
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,530
but that would be annoying what if you
did this on people

524
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,470
this is the cool thing about life is
that we all train each other and I've

525
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:29,660
heard this in the last knowing the in
Guard spokesman here for a few days

526
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,618
for conference we've all been talking I
realized like God we will train each

527
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:37,490
other on how we want to be communicated
with how often what we want that to look

528
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,209
like hey when you text me before you
call me is one but another one is like

529
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,599
if you want something for me yelling
views not going to help could you

530
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,069
instead tell me what's important to you
or whatever so these are the people who

531
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:53,808
trained me and if you think in your own
life you've got you've got these people

532
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:57,289
to these are my these are my this is my
family home

533
00:35:57,289 --> 00:36:00,920
these are my family at work they're the
ones who tell me each day with a like

534
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,390
and how this is going to land better and
hopefully after this talk so if you'll

535
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,839
come and talk to me and you'll train me
and tell me how you'd like to hear this

536
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:12,440
kind of how they would like to hear this
kind of material the conference I know a

537
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,440
bunch of you who like it well i hope the
ones who don't like it well too

538
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:23,539
ok so I'm check we're doing good so
story 11 reinventing the wheel this is

539
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:27,380
something we did the first for fishing
engagements and guardians did we

540
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,490
everything built their own fishing
infrastructure from scratch and they

541
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,788
generally build something that would
last only for that one engagement and

542
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:38,599
never again which meant that we were
spending more time than we needed to and

543
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,010
we weren't getting crafty we weren't
getting we weren't getting better so

544
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,700
we're kind of like we're not getting
better we're just basically building and

545
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:52,399
rebuilding and and reinventing the wheel
over and over again so for us we think

546
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,410
either find a good tool fishing friends
is one of our favorites or develop your

547
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,220
own and then teach everybody how to use
it if it's important to you you gotta

548
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,390
talk to people you gotta talk to a lot
of people I got frustrated like I built

549
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,940
a tool it's really good and no one's
using it

550
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,349
oh did I go around and tell people about
it that I do my part in making sure that

551
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:14,420
they that they knew that it existed

552
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,930
did I trained some people on the tools
they made it so that I lowered so I so I

553
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,200
made it easier for them to get into it
and easier for them to go where I want

554
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,399
them to go up every fishing test should
make you better fishing so get better

555
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,289
stagnate this is true on again for
everything in your work life so for us

556
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:36,829
it's kind of like we create some mail
servers and we stopped reading mail

557
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:40,609
servers at this point we know that every
time that we use a fishing else or

558
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:42,210
anyone existing ones

559
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,430
new domains but we've made it really
easy is to switch over the domains uh I

560
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,419
really i started out like many of us and
security as a system administrator where

561
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,200
he learns the rule of enlightened
laziness side of Larry pull out of Larry

562
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,430
pearls program / lightly ball and it
basically said automate everything you

563
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,819
can or if you're going to do it twice
automated heck you gonna do once

564
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,810
probably automated but automate
everything you can let your laziness let

565
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,650
your own desire not redo something over
and over again and have that be boring

566
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:15,240
of end up saving you time and making it
so that you can take time and truly

567
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,399
create and that way you can actually up
and up and up it so last story an omen

568
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,040
unknown impact we did a ton of fishing
and pigments and we never found out my

569
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,869
client we never went ask the client hey
uh what was the impact like are you guys

570
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:34,260
getting better reporting you guys you
know are people getting cautious as much

571
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,540
by pitching after as before and
eventually what happened was client came

572
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,200
to us and said hey I want to let you
know like here's a slide that I

573
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,640
presented to our board

574
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,920
I'm like you're bored wow I like that
and said this is this is what happened

575
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,940
before your fishing engagement our
reporting rates on phishing scams worth

576
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,810
this level

577
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:59,670
afterwards they jumped up to this level
and people are way better at calling

578
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,450
helpdesk and telling them something is
going on and i found that when the

579
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,919
client told me that I got this kind of
joy and I got satisfaction knowing that

580
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,550
what I was doing was making some kind of
a difference and often communicating is

581
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,890
the only way you do that going to ask
what kind of difference you're making

582
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,118
how did that work for you uh you should
I think everyone's probably getting this

583
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,650
talk is really about fishing

584
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,430
I mean it is we're talking about fishing
entirely this is really useful stuff

585
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,980
efficient but this is kind of like Jays
rules for life whether it's you know

586
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,520
like with your family life inside your
company like with your client

587
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,720
this is just stuff that really really
really helps ask the people ask the

588
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,810
people you're acting with how that
interaction went afterwards

589
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:44,460
what did they get out of it and you'll
be surprised how much joy you get out of

590
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,509
people saying

591
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:48,659
you know I know that call was really
hard and we were fighting and i was so

592
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:52,109
happy for I learned so much for it felt
so much closer to you or whatever

593
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:58,709
Oh last slide I've been presenting for a
very long time of the conference's 1999

594
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:01,678
somewhere in the middle i had this much
hair

595
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:08,189
not much uh I lost my hair by not
following this kind of advice so I hope

596
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:13,348
you will have much more Joyce less
stressful and less hair losing careers

597
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:13,949
thank you very much
