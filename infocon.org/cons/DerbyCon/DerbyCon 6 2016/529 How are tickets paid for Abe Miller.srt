1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
ok yes oh you can go ahead yet because
otherwise people are up alone in their

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,340
rooms and uncertain little more outward
thinking about that we can see it's all

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,279
really yeah I'm back on the other side
of the sexes boutique so we're going to

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,220
get the feet he's not that one

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,279
alright well I guess we'll jump in

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,279
I I process not actually about how to
pay for tickets I feel like it does

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,980
require some kind of haiku or something
which i'm not clever enough to create

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:44,010
575 souls or whatever it is but yeah
it's a I made Miller I my oh my I yet

9
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,879
i'm from chicago which area i said old
thing out of all how many of you are

10
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:55,649
from Chicago anyone Chicago proper or
from Chicago is a and I was so i can

11
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,210
give you a one of my where were you born
answers to my security questions is I

12
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,320
was not actually born in chicago but I
grew up their second grade on and then I

13
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:14,250
moved out to the boondocks which is
elgin illinois which I don't think we

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,390
have your reporter to know what

15
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,700
so why am i presenting today uh well
there's a bit of a an awkward funny

16
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,960
story about that now if you write out I
vegetables you actually read i guess the

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,729
application summary that was placed out
there it is pretty straightforward i was

18
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:48,000
a desperate man and we're going to
employ without a corporate card and I

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,509
don't know the peel purchase process and
I got to the Derby con citing I'm a new

20
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,920
further behind and I've been to thought
on several times of been to those out

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,670
west but i was i was really myself in my
teammate were really going home to get

22
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,560
the training in right and well there's
the information I think maybe you

23
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,730
already saw that many already knew it
wasn't an issue but me being me

24
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,870
it just came down to I had to sell the
problems out some way and in the

25
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,860
thoughts of using social media never
occurred to me because I'm very much

26
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,770
against a web one . okay so I mean I do
have a twitter handle that has three

27
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:34,030
entries from five years ago arm and but
I is the only entry i could find which

28
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,710
was says you know now the site
submission for which is hey now you have

29
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,600
a backdoor into this conference if
anyone i cannot make the cut in the

30
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,260
first few days to go until next year I
suppose just gotta make the crew laughs

31
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,859
I'm assuming that as long as this
doesn't bomb completely and you walk

32
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,730
away so the best chance you have is to
endorse me fully afterward

33
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:03,880
alright so y axis resent so it really
comes down to on this tiny screen of me

34
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,769
saying it was just me being myself being
goofy and thinking naively that someone

35
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:14,320
was actually watching the page the
recession submission forms on an hourly

36
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,220
basis

37
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,859
well as I've never thrown a conference
so I didn't know but arm so what am i

38
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,500
presenting and so that's what this is
where the little pudding but the story

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,240
comes is that I i did manage to buy me
master by the training turned out you

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,540
guys take this number part right

41
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,970
the only family car be still said define
and I so i bought the training it wasn't

42
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,490
a problem in a week goes by and then
also I get the not actually a few weeks

43
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,630
went by and I got the auto email that
says your submission is progressing I'm

44
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,430
like what that is a no yelling of my
life in the kitchen who I think probably

45
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,580
sorry ignore me but I said so weird it
was like I got the thing about my

46
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,500
question about how to buy tickets became
a session or not yet but they're still

47
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,500
in there I thought for sure they would
flush

48
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:19,380
I'm just going to win this man is needed

49
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,849
thank you for covering the base on that
one

50
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:44,440
no I'm good actually like that song
three girls me and I have three girls so

51
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:55,180
yeah so I yes I'm like would be so weird
they actually got my humor and they're

52
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,890
going to go ahead and make it an actual
session and she's my wife like listening

53
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:06,490
to me just like always like what-what
burgers like nevermind

54
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,950
but anyway it just comes down to that
flash for a few more weeks going to bed

55
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,400
at 10pm because i don't actually hack
and I guess I I just have to check my

56
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,320
email and there's an email from David
Kennedy family David Kennedy who's this

57
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,770
guy and a man summary we review this and
you made us laugh I'm like what's going

58
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,380
to do it up to create school and um and
it is it turns out you don't he offered

59
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:45,640
me the chance to present on whatever the
heck I want it only took me about 30

60
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,229
seconds to answer

61
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:54,100
ah yeah you're who you are but uh yeah
okay I can do that i already have

62
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,370
tickets by the way you don't have to
send me tickets so probably didn't think

63
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,750
I had another co-worker forgot who did
try to get tickets and in so doing is

64
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:09,580
lucky made it in the rest i got didn't
work out but anyway anyway so what was I

65
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:16,390
gonna present on so the theme comes down
to I ok i was really going to be debbie

66
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:25,330
downer now is I alright so if I got in
me that I should give you some of me in

67
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,240
the non-physical sense arm

68
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,650
yeah yeah hey around the side of love
boutique you're fine

69
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,840
fine um I walked past it for the last 35
or 4 days right miss I'm sorry I have a

70
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,630
problem the mannequins why they still
using mannequins from the seventies in

71
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,440
there they should be a whole market what
we call it the untapped market of

72
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,010
mannequins they should totally update
anyway I have a.d.d throw that out there

73
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,300
but one of the other things I hadn't met
and I there was a whole row to realize

74
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,080
full of students that were following the
previous presenter and I think some of

75
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,380
this would apply to them but there was a
presentation earlier today and has been

76
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,600
a presentation lately but the theme
being you name it right uh inferiority

77
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:19,870
complex confidence issues whatever you
want to call it I the latest impostor

78
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:27,040
syndrome like it sounds like various
character which i think almost was so

79
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,720
into me if I was gonna give you some of
something of mine and I think I have

80
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,430
some value and talking about is
overcoming insecurity to a degree right

81
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,560
it's it's guess it's the same thing we
can all hear the loud chaotic noise

82
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,140
that's in our own heads but we never
hear that everyone else is except for

83
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,849
the hundred and twenty four characters
or whatever it is for twitter that comes

84
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,930
through every once in awhile right are
my ridiculously overly long facebook

85
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,640
posts to my family but Tom but the
reality is we all struggle we all

86
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,530
struggle and so I want to like get into
why do we feel insecure and I don't know

87
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,909
why everyone does like taking i took
that was a very confused I going to

88
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,169
college so I started off the journalism
when biology medical wanted political

89
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:12,549
science

90
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,150
she was a political science and then I
almost went into urban planning before I

91
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,780
earn my GPA just dropping I open with
your credit card companies like left

92
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,710
college went to work for a credit card
company and then reboot my career but

93
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,310
they would only pay you to go back if
you would get in your career field which

94
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,150
by then I discovered hey look i'm still
pretty good with computers so I went

95
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:40,030
back for computer science test board are
hearing but i have to go through a

96
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,270
period where I'm like I want to be a
security person around myself out but

97
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,270
then you get in there and it's like
there's a lot to know

98
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,160
right and you're trying to do trying to
like you're going to these conversations

99
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,689
with people why shouldn't I have to tell
my open to the internet and those

100
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,660
conversations are still taking place up
to five years ago right

101
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,399
and anyway in an early on it's your
struggle because because i said so you

102
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,910
know I mean what do you say oh yeah it's
it's very much

103
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,300
I I learned some of the lesson when I
was a hardware tech here before that

104
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,010
that if you ever came up to a customer
or client if you had any hint of like

105
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,709
they're like what's wrong with your
computer and you're like I don't know

106
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,779
arm but if you can say i don't know in a
very forceful way they tend to accept

107
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:27,339
that it's very it's like if you can say
your unknown in a very confident fashion

108
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:33,790
people accept that but if you give any
hint of self-doubt that's when you to

109
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,360
you usually find yourself on a sunday
afternoon being yelled at my morbidly

110
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,860
obese woman nightmares anyway uh but so
what

111
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,040
why but I don't know why everyone else
though right so that I took the classes

112
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,240
of social psychology teaches you one
thing and I'm gonna say this much about

113
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,779
it was a one that always sticks through
me and social account how the classic

114
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:00,490
took was about um I think we may have
heard this example about the woman in

115
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:06,190
$YEAR in new york back in the sixties
early seventies who was stabbed in broad

116
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:12,010
nighttime on a very uppity there was
witnesses up the up the gut of the wazoo

117
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:17,260
they're like 2012 witnesses who witness
are being stabbed and nobody called the

118
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,640
police when they call that s that you
get you actually experience it on a

119
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,040
daily basis now if you work in corporate
America by asking for something and

120
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,000
sending more than two people in the to
address called the fusion of authority

121
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,529
everyone thinks someone else is gonna do
it right so I tell you by the way if you

122
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:39,970
are helping with someone and cardiac
arrest or you know CPR you . someone say

123
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,770
you go call them whatever right because
now it's one person being picked you

124
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,439
don't just scream to someone get help
then everyone just wait for someone else

125
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,579
to get help

126
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:52,870
alright so now that explained that to
you by social psychology there's another

127
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,290
term by a name I cannot remember to help
my save my life but

128
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,519
you will not ever fall for that ok this
will now be in the back of your head is

129
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,800
like a woman got stat but what doesn
witnesses know anything but if any one

130
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,180
of them had ever heard this story they
would have known my god everyone else is

131
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,000
probably thinking not to call you know
someone else who can do either be that

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,740
person right

133
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:21,800
alright so for less worth like i said i
don't know what anyone elses reasons for

134
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,740
feeling insecure about the the world

135
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,269
maybe but I know where mine are and i
know some of the roots are you can get

136
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:33,440
into a lot of that battle but it's out
of time and I think we're already

137
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,829
getting close but so onto the what I'm
hoping that should be fun issues we hang

138
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:45,229
out later Dorie so why I blame the roots
the very beginnings of my insecurities

139
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:52,100
on one man in particular particular
beautiful blonde haired long locks sky

140
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,000
got ya this son-of-a-bitch

141
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:02,449
excuse me could do anything and is very
first episode right he leaps off the

142
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:06,740
plateaus of somewhere in China with an
ultra-light made out of

143
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,709
I don't know steel tubing and somehow
manage the flying off limit as n to his

144
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:16,849
death right there right and from then on
it just defies reason but he was amazed

145
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,250
at that each right without born
mid-seventies and god i want to be

146
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,959
MacGyver so bad so bad and he's actually
just a real person but you don't really

147
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,050
differentiate that especially I grew up
in inner city Chicago at this point

148
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,880
right on this guy was like man he could
get himself out of any situation you

149
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,120
know that last summer being stuck by the
tree hanging from a large branch for 15

150
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,390
minutes waiting for someone to save me I
could have got out of it allows the

151
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:48,500
driver said I want to just drop but up
anyway but easier this is like what I

152
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,250
think we start to put other people on
pedestals and it happens very early on I

153
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:58,130
didn't know I was going to be a security
guy 20-plus years later but but this is

154
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,120
where the foundation starts and then
there's one more and i grew up i granted

155
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,350
this is more for if anyone's ever had to
deal with bullies or anyone else had

156
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,200
ever bothered them for no particular
reason other than that you were

157
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:16,800
them right then you can blame this guy
right for any other ones i mean he can

158
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,260
do anything grand you's a billionaire we
can argue about who's the greatest

159
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,319
superhero batman is but it's the reality
is you can do just by having is all of

160
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,090
the powers brains and really large
reservoir saw funds and other scientists

161
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,540
doing stuff for him but you don't really
think about that as a kid you're saying

162
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,520
disconnected even the campy 60-70 so I
mean you left you have the same

163
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,689
bat-channel like the laser whatever it
was about the kundiman to write up the

164
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,400
green which is always a common theme
with him very strange but uh he always

165
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,040
got out of it right there is always
something in that damn yellow utility

166
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,900
belt that we all want but he always had
a trick up his sleeve which was

167
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:01,199
something I always sort of NB but you
know we get I we get around it to a

168
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,630
degree but we get in this field and so
we're kind of overwhelmed with the idea

169
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,010
that we have to know all the things
right and we ended its now it's almost

170
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,870
becoming a trope within our field to to
have a presentation we say no all the

171
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:19,170
things right all the things just
whatever early trial that's why i think

172
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,099
i've got two more of like I found some
kind of steady state that said yeah man

173
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,350
you're not going to be everything to
everyone

174
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,730
maybe I just like I came into the middle
of this field right I came in after most

175
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:37,470
of the the pioneer sort of set the stage
for us right and i don't know i guess it

176
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,070
had and number means i also
overcompensated by large i have a good

177
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,850
sizable student loan debt just because I
figured dude i'm not going to feel

178
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,570
comfortable to have a master's degree so
i'm rebooting what to get my computer

179
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,500
science guy no it's not necessary and i
will not advocated I mean it but if you

180
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,390
feel like you need it and you can live
with it then hey it doesn't hurt other

181
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,140
than the bill once a month the next 15
years

182
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:07,290
um so what I came down to learn about
like and this is why all of the one

183
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,890
compound say to us saying hey we need to
make this feel more professional and

184
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,240
that's fair except that the world is
still shaken out right

185
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,010
we are like the medical profession of
our uh our yeah I guess medical

186
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,430
profession of the 1800 so we're just
barely getting out of

187
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,390
like just no bleeding people for the
heck of it you know the shutdown alright

188
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,470
alright so the days of no or gone right
hopefully everyone's organizations but

189
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,410
the reality is every business is
different right

190
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,860
doctors have the opportunity to say I
know what I work in a hospital someday

191
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,270
or a clinic that's always staffed and
set up the same way for how many people

192
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:48,689
report to the CIO and then how do you
report to CFO's or for some other right

193
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,920
or don't just you're in a blob you
happen to be tasked security because

194
00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:02,010
you're the guy who once asked some of
their badge you know and so I it its .

195
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,899
we have no choice but to try everything
and and I think that big thing this one

196
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,660
trying to steal my own daughters and i'm
adding ime if you haven't washes arm is

197
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,990
that it's it's you can't know everything
right and a Titan everyone tells you

198
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,620
that but the biggest thing really what
you need to do is turn around and then

199
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,940
first off keep in mind that impostor
syndrome is a syndrome that's not a

200
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,589
light term that means it happens a lot
means a lot of people so one-off take

201
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:36,180
some solace in knowing you're not alone
and let her mental noise going on in

202
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:44,130
your head right to to school I mean my
god i had my guys well I had a stint as

203
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,700
a director because they needed someone
to become a director and I made a

204
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,130
mistake of going ok and one guy I hired
he was just paranoid we're going to get

205
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,850
breached

206
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,790
I'm like dude if you got pre-check can
be the best thing for your career

207
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,209
because you're ready pre-disaster you
could go out of here

208
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:04,919
oh yeah I lived through a breach wasn't
the reality is we all present our

209
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,480
suggestions right do they always take
them know even if you know all the

210
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,790
things does that fix it

211
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:18,178
no i mean so what I've come to the grip
is I really do drive to make my place

212
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,439
more secure I'm trying to help my
employers and my coworker stay employee

213
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,300
right keeps my daughter's can keep
taking clarinet lessons in the basement

214
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:34,200
on but it's it but it's at that like
it's a point of meeting you know what I

215
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,870
say I can't do that we have to

216
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,320
bring someone in right and sometimes
it's like I've told you this 10 times

217
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,350
we're bringing someone in so they can
tell you that so that it sounds legit

218
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,610
right

219
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:50,870
just admit it so that's kind of thing
now that all said oh damn i just want to

220
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,429
talk about a possible miles that's a
look at the other product presentation

221
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,640
earlier which by the way she didn't use
any deck so i cant even refer to hers

222
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,280
are but you just have to find some inner
peace right with yourself and that's the

223
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,190
only way it's going to be personal to
everybody and how you learn and how you

224
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:13,970
tackle challenges but there's still an
issue right and the big one is

225
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,040
especially I think for our career career
field I don't see that many older

226
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,300
information security guys that work with
me right i mean there's money

227
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,669
professionals here but I look around and
I'm like on the forward edge of the

228
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,410
curves now

229
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:38,059
yeah very good missing yet by slipping
lines anyway but it's the realize

230
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,520
realization the time is coming down

231
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:46,639
oh really depressed to get but the the
the point is more about there's always

232
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,290
this is really about the given day

233
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,010
alright so that pick out anymore PHP and
i actually have to do this like three

234
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,370
weeks ago i learned enough to be able to
use decrypt the tear apart a bunch of

235
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,090
half-baked passwords everything handed
to us by information sharing service and

236
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,928
Link thanks guys so to figure out which
one's actually matched and I thought to

237
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:07,940
myself and about eight hours at least
run this right

238
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,240
yay for me I was very very freaking
proud of myself like a the brain cells

239
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,230
can still do this new stuff is pretty
good but it that what i do that recipe

240
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,170
that the rest of day nothing else is
just learning that right and there's

241
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,700
only so much time we haven't

242
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,970
yeah we all know budgets are pretty
tight so there's this other thing I've

243
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:28,490
learned knowledge i'm hitting this
middle ages and for this one stage in

244
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,600
your career you go all right um I still
have to freakin fit everything in

245
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,928
so enter the new heroes we have to
master time so naturally there's two new

246
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:42,530
ones that come to mind one you guys that
was coming already right

247
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,790
yeah this one not the other two anyway

248
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,100
yet sometimes my first doctor

249
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,949
as an adult anyway so mom alright so
yeah we have x man i wish i wish i had

250
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,970
another way to compress more time into a
day right so i can not be in the

251
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,789
basement I could actually be upstairs
like playing with my daughters

252
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:05,870
or i could actually be talking to people
working helping them be more secure home

253
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,189
versus be more secure at work but deal
with what you can you have to prioritize

254
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:16,490
and then the little time you know they
just move fast as hell right and i think

255
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,270
this is the this how monster energy is
making a freaking killing off of us

256
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,610
write all the energy drinks

257
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,969
I mean we got to start talking about our
freakin it a collective addiction to

258
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,080
energy drinks that's next to me that's
probably the next defcon like social

259
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,809
talk is going to be people you chill on
the Red Bull um but nonetheless it's all

260
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:38,990
good so what are gonna have to do now is
just accept that

261
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,470
yeah you got to deal with it again it's
the repeat and uh that's pretty much all

262
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,970
i have for you guys so

263
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,110
oh yes just because this bothers the
hell out of me and I like i said i have

264
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:58,580
a.d.d this is not a bird bird stopped
having teeth 65 million years ago

265
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:19,520
thank you for my finger in my honorarium
it thanks guys
