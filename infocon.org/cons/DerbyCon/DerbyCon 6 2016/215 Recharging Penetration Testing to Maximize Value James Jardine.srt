1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,410
all right where did the camera give me
does it start to state i want to move

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,740
around too much then but i do like to
move my good i need tape on the floor

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,230
pan allowed

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,320
alright so it's ten o'clock so i don't
you tell one sorry for the little

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,300
technical issues that we had but now
we've got that worked out thanks for

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,529
getting up early on a Sunday to come in
here I know that can be tough especially

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,880
after the big party that they have on
sunday or saturday night as we're going

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,250
to talk about recharging penetration
testing to maximize value and so pen

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,170
testing something to do for a long time
I focus on App sec side of the house and

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,270
I used to do all of it but now I really
just focus on the app's exide so that's

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,579
what we're going to kind of look but a
lot of this stuff that we're gonna talk

12
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,700
about can be pulled over into the
network side as well or Wi-Fi whatever

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,910
you testing so just a little bit about
me

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,839
my name is James starting if you haven't
met me before if you have great if not

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,629
feel free to come up I love meeting new
people

16
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,610
i'm the CEO of charting software don't
let the software confuse you have had

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,049
the company for a long time or I used to
do software and now I focus on the

18
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,600
application security services for my
clients

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,830
I'm doing things like program reviews
penetration testing and security

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,869
education do a lot of instructing a lot
of presenting presenting a few years ago

21
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,210
and most notably more is I do a lot of
blogging and podcasting so a lot of the

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,169
stuff that I talked about I also write
about i talked about on a podcast I'm so

23
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,890
you can check those out i got listed at
the bottom there so why we want to talk

24
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,180
about this for me and I just came up
with this morning so bear with me

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,740
630 I woke up and I was like you know
what this is perfect so I like to do

26
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,070
woodworking and such on the side when
I'm when I'm not working on security

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,619
stuff and so recently this is a bench
that we had that is very old

28
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,890
you know you should be a park bench in
the city and then it got kind of moved

29
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:01,320
over and they replaced them so we got
our hands on top but it's pretty quickly

30
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,279
right its functional we can sit on it
works it's good i but it is pretty

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,160
rundown absolutely actually took some
time and we redid it a little bit

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,579
this is the greatest picture i get a
better one that I did I felt bad saying

33
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,690
this is the same French this is the same
bench but I read it right and i said

34
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,300
look this is gonna be something is going
to be more enticing people going to be

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,720
interested in looking at it they want to
deal with it they may want to sit in it

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,930
may actually start conversations so we
redid it original wood new hardware but

37
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,480
the rails and everything are all the
same right

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,049
it's much better this one the pictures
just a little bit better but it's not

39
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,040
the same thing you just look the same
but just to show right i mean the

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,179
functionality didn't change but we get
out of it might actually be more because

41
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,960
we might start more conversation about
it so that's why i thought you know what

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,430
this kind of an interesting lead into
when we talk about pentesting as it is

43
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,600
versus where I think there's some places
we can make some enhancements to make

44
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,470
pentesting better and more valuable to
our clients we know we're doing when we

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,390
pen tap so how can we get more out of
the clients so the first question we

46
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,959
have what is pentesting alright
everybody this is different

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,800
I mean depending on who you talk to it's
actually going in and trying to get

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,790
doesn't matter whether its network
whether its web whether it's Wi-Fi right

49
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,260
now you're trying to penetrate in as far
as you can you get specific goals i want

50
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,549
to get domain credentials I want to get
all this data but you talk to other

51
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,120
people and a lot of times especially
when we talk about a pen testing it's

52
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,320
more about really the vulnerability
doesn't kind of steroids right here i

53
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,310
want to go find as much as I can about
this application find all the security

54
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,370
risks and then bring those over report
them and bring them back to the client

55
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,870
so they can get better at developing
software right rarely are we seeing

56
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,930
we're getting in there through an
application like this and getting domain

57
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,350
cred right a lot of our appt set out on
different servers are not even on our

58
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,880
infrastructure so we're not get this
right so a lot of the testing that we

59
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,350
see actually turns into really a
vulnerability assessment with some

60
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,650
exploitation involved right we're
identifying cross-site scripting and

61
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,280
sequel injection and logic blog and all
these different things right with to

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,480
understand what are we doing women and
how the different from things like bug

63
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,869
bounties right i mean how different away
from that and there's a big difference

64
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,040
there won't get into this but there's a
big difference

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,970
and then from what we're doing I you
know we do stuff on a contractual basis

66
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,620
we're doing things specifically for the
clients not its own silo will talk about

67
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,840
so anybody tender become last year mr.
pretty regular event people like coming

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,710
to this right

69
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,330
anybody hit the panel that they had on
the future of infosec I wasn't your last

70
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,310
year but i did watch the video as exotic
screenshot of it I it was good right

71
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,280
talking about where we going with this
and they talked a lot about penetration

72
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,809
testing and we're getting more into the
need of saying hey I can't just provide

73
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,520
a simple report of haiti across it
scripting we have to start mapping this

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,169
stuff and you know what let's go to
refer to as adversarial mapping right

75
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,470
getting further into and saying okay yes
you have cross-site scripting but what

76
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,880
does that mean what does that mean to
you in your organization because if it's

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,690
just a generic i have cross-site
scripting well then what does that

78
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,380
really mean for me as far as when i
would bet on my priority list right a

79
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,440
healthcare system may be different than
the financial system which is different

80
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,390
than your marketing site that's out
there

81
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,169
writes all still risk but i have to
understand how does it really affect me

82
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,340
and that's our goal was pentesting
writers were coming in saying i'm going

83
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,900
to put value behind these things that
we're going to identify not just

84
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,669
identifiable right we talk about David
Kennedy mentioned how the red team

85
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,880
learned from the blue team you know one
thing going to say is even though we

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,810
like to separate red and blue red is
really part of blue right we are a

87
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,490
defensive mechanism to be able to help
the defensive side if we weren't part of

88
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,380
blue that we'd actually destroy things
really actually still the data user

89
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,520
prevent we're here to help build up the
blue side and they hate your we're

90
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,479
testing your weaknesses were identifying
and we're gonna help you get past that

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,860
you know quantifying how while that
defense is detecting you that's

92
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,330
typically more unfortunately on the
network side applications still do a

93
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,450
really horrible job but doing good
logging so that people know what's going

94
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,599
on in them anyway but it's still
something that we're trying to detect

95
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,680
right when we do a nap past you know
there should be somebody looking to see

96
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,880
if we're gonna do this now the question
is who's looking probably not our

97
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,570
developers right i mean they're not
looking at the logs they look at

98
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,700
troubleshooting log they don't look at
traffic

99
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,140
logs and attack logs and those side
effects understanding our failure points

100
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,460
right Don strand talk about that and
nickerson who you know near to my heart

101
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:45,159
the idea that we are a quality assurance
industry right now we're pentesting when

102
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,240
we're doing any type of testing whether
bug bounty pentesting however it is

103
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,380
right it's QA I mean it is a form of you
a we're helping them understand the

104
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:59,650
quality of their application the quality
of their network against security not

105
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,039
just the we spelled stuff wrong or
functionally doesn't work and we expect

106
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,700
right so we're value at to them but one
of the concerns I often see I don't know

107
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,479
how many people saw this floating around
Twitter not long after it came out a

108
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,920
bunch of people were two hashtagging pen
testers on it you know as if this is how

109
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,600
we're proceed right we come in with
break stuff and relieve sorry about your

110
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,900
bad luck I'm not cleaning this up right
and that's a problem

111
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,510
I mean if this is really how we're
perceived then why do people want to

112
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,240
work with us right i don't want somebody
just come in and break a whole bunch of

113
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,710
my stuff and leave

114
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,169
I want somebody's gonna be a partner in
what I'm doing I want somebody to help

115
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:42,970
me out so I thought that was interesting
actually got me all riled up and if you

116
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,950
don't hear me talk offline i'll rant
about this stuff all day long but

117
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,420
working on changing that perception
right we don't want to be that we want

118
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,410
to be more than just a tester want to be
more than just a red team of coming in

119
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,660
and said hey I'll find some
vulnerabilities and i'll send him your

120
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,130
way to be more than a breaker right we
always say well we're breakers were not

121
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,760
fixed I'm not saying we have to be
pictures right that is a specialized

122
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,020
skill and quite honestly most of us
probably do not have that skill we're

123
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,380
good at breaking and it's nothing wrong
with that right with to embrace that but

124
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,300
we're here to be the experts right I'm
hiring a pen test company to come in and

125
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,560
test my apps i'm assuming you are a
network export you are an application

126
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,560
security expert right you know how this
stuff work and much deeper than just

127
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,340
being able to break it right and when we
look on the network site we have to know

128
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,020
this stuff how many people that do
network testing really understand

129
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,299
networks and they understand server
admin

130
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,750
you know you can go into a linux box and
walk your way around a command line and

131
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,260
do all this stuff but then you start
getting out start a web app testing

132
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,529
mobile app testing and it's like yeah I
can run a proxy and I can run some of

133
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,310
these tools but maybe I don't know
exactly how development works i write

134
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,339
some script that's not really
development you know I work together

135
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:00,100
some tools but enterprise development
very different

136
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,170
so we don't understand that I'm so it's
kind of a detriment to us but we're here

137
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,510
to help right if we understand that I'm
not here to be in a silo right i would

138
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,779
like to say breaking down the silos we
should help

139
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,790
we're here to test for a reason it's not
just adversarial testing that we're

140
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,620
doing we actually want to be providing
value back to the client and

141
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,279
unfortunately to do that we have to pack
that whole process use social

142
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,110
engineering to get them to understand
what we're saying matters everything

143
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,260
that we put out there doesn't mean it's
going to be something on the top of

144
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,189
everybody's less and I saw somebody not
too long ago they were ranting on

145
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,750
twitter about you know username
harvesting flaw and how it wasn't part

146
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,770
of a lot of bug bounties you know and as
we talked about it through the Twitter

147
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,040
hundred forty character limit which is
ridiculous by the way to have a

148
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,599
conversation as we talked about that I
started asking the question right but

149
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,010
why does it matter

150
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,980
i mean you're talking username
harvesting what are you trying to do

151
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,930
with it because everything you're trying
to do you've got a million user names in

152
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,010
your list that you've downloaded from
some breach and you want to go and

153
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,550
attack the site with that ok well what
username harvesting going to get you

154
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,160
going to help reduce your list right

155
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,640
great it'll be less queries going again
but quite honestly nobody logging so if

156
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,270
i send a million requests rights and a
hundred thousand requests if they're not

157
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:30,279
logging it doesn't matter if they are
logging that's 100,000 requested privacy

158
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,649
anyway so it didn't help me write so yes
it's a flaw but we have to understand

159
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,070
what is that plot mean and is it
important to the company because I can

160
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:44,230
do all that stuff with using harvesting
do without it you know until you want to

161
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,100
get down into really specific hey I want
to Spearfish people and I know your user

162
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,760
of this system so now i can send out
just to users and cut down

163
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,880
traffic but as far as attacking as I
directly write that not a necessary

164
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,189
means we can get around them so i always
like to say application and network

165
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,280
right there different anybody that
thinks the otherwise i'm willing to say

166
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,780
you're wrong there are different right
like i said before I mean application

167
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,199
people they know applications they know
development that it's a different set of

168
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,710
vulnerabilities that we're looking at
verses we're looking at the network

169
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:25,570
right we use different tools we use
different knowledge look at the tools

170
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,820
right what I'm doing a network
assessment we're looking at things like

171
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,740
cali and we use the metasploit right
Nessus an nmap and we've got this whole

172
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,680
list of tools that we could use to
attack a network right we've got

173
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,400
responder out there we got these
different techniques that we use that if

174
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,949
we get on your network this is what
we're going to attack with and this is

175
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,270
just a short list don't feel like a
gypsy anybody but then we look on the

176
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:52,420
applications i read these different
tools rarely am i using metasploit on an

177
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,939
application tasks except for if I
actually find a vulnerability through

178
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,180
some other means and then i'm going to
try to exploit it right like I'm

179
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,410
actually going to put a remote shell on
a machine but i'm not using metasploit

180
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,579
to find vulnerabilities in the webapp
anybody do that doesn't work very well

181
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,200
far as i know right typically we're
using verbal using a proxy of some sort

182
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,130
to find those animals would find them we
switch into tools i use my sequel map i

183
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,180
use these other things get around but
I'm not relying on the same types of

184
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,719
tools you know you might even run Nessus
but it's not going to give you a whole

185
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,250
lot with your web app it's more
infrastructure related so we have to

186
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,040
understand that these tools of
difference that we're using out there

187
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,719
the knowledge that we're using a
different right so that works odd it's

188
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,250
very heavy on the networking knowledge
your server admin pipe knowledge

189
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,380
understanding OS is all the stuff that's
going on in your dhcp dns and all that

190
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,310
stuff while you go into a knapsack
interview and they'll ask you those

191
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,239
questions but not nearly as relevant
right because i'm attacking an

192
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,800
application a true application
credentialed much do i need to know

193
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,930
about the NS a whole lot already know
about the ECP I don't need to know about

194
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,378
a lot of

195
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:09,729
packet traffic going back and forth
because I pack it differently and so

196
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:13,359
there's a different knowledge there an
application i say look we have to

197
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,689
understand development we have to
understand how applications are built

198
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:21,969
the same way we need to understand how
networks are Bill and of course

199
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,479
networking and server that all comes
into play with an application security

200
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:29,949
deal because what we actually pop the
box we find a way in

201
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:34,508
now we have to know all this stuff but
it's a very different context because

202
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:39,159
how often are you getting that far with
applications and then once you do i know

203
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:46,659
you have to have that so i always say we
need to have a solid understanding of

204
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,009
development

205
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:51,069
I just like I've said before we have to
have a good solid understanding of

206
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:54,969
networking when I go in and test Network
I have to have an understanding network

207
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,059
have to understand the protocol that
have to understand all that stuff you're

208
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:01,179
gonna go to Wi-Fi right you have to
understand those tools you have to

209
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:04,059
understand that same thing with
development we have to understand how

210
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:08,079
these after built there's so much change
going on and development right now we've

211
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,649
got angular like so much client-side
stuff now that's going on so not even

212
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,959
half of its server side anymore

213
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,149
now you're attacking things like angular
and react now they've got electron out

214
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:24,249
which we can actually make like desktop
apps that are all filled with javascript

215
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:30,429
then call out to api's you know if you
slack anybody slack that's written an

216
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:34,869
electron I'm so it's a JavaScript
application write javascript HTML and

217
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:40,299
CSS all put on there we can put a
cross-platform it's loading items from

218
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:45,249
outside down in right this is a
potential security concern but if we

219
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:51,729
don't understand how this stuff works we
can help go in and attack it right so we

220
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:56,350
have to do that side the way I say going
about this is no biltmore stop you know

221
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,139
if you're actually interested in
application development just like if

222
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:01,689
you're interested in network you know
you're gonna go out you're going to

223
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:05,139
build networks right you're going to set
them up you're gonna feel cool domains

224
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,559
you can do all this stuff from build
some apps you know understand what

225
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,179
developers go through as their building
applications because it'll help you out

226
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:18,699
a lot i just recently did a presentation
back in jacksonville code on the beach

227
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,290
i did a presentation for developers I
mean that's a developer conference and

228
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,760
talking to them about but this is how i
look at applications because we always

229
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,150
say write developers look at
applications differently than we look at

230
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,590
application are going to say this is how
i look at application and up the

231
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,470
applications i looked at over the years

232
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,960
here's the things that I see this you
see that right so you come in and you

233
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:50,320
see a nice little ecommerce site where i
can add items to my cards right I see

234
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,160
the ability to put negative values in
there and take money from you and put in

235
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,589
my cal right or I see ways to on your
simple contact us form because you

236
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,150
decided to put the to address in the
form and a hidden field

237
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:09,819
IC away where I use as a span mailing
system but you're seeing it this when we

238
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,540
start talking to about that they start
to understand it you know we do a lot of

239
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,260
talking about developers don't know what
they're doing with security and these

240
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,189
apps are crap and all that but if you
really look at the apps aren't junk

241
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,720
right there not just falling apart
they're working they're getting what

242
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,790
they expected to have it done

243
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,329
are they missing a security said yes
right and so that's what we're here to

244
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:36,160
help with help get that across to
everybody that there is a security peace

245
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,510
what we're trying to do how can we help
do that and so as we start to understand

246
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,170
it i think we understand it more in the
network time because a lot of us come

247
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,189
from a network background so you under
the that's just part of what you did

248
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,950
so you already understand that we're
going to try to understand network

249
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,870
concepts and all that but going in and
understanding how apps are built within

250
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,190
an enterprise and going through you know
whether doing continuous integration you

251
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,580
know how it goes through QA I mean
there's this whole process we got DevOps

252
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,360
we get the exact opposite respective ops
or I don't know what the colonies did I

253
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,990
don't know i have often that security at
the beginning because it's fairly new

254
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,890
but we've got all these things but we
don't understand the processes so when

255
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,959
we say oh you've got cross-site
scripting I don't know why that's not

256
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,730
fixed today but you don't know their
process for getting that from

257
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,490
development up into production and some
companies it could be a nightmare right

258
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,610
mean it could be an extra a really long
process to try to push a patch into

259
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,409
production

260
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,520
so that's why it's not happening so
quickly but we start to understand that

261
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,930
we start to understand how the tools
work that they develop with but we know

262
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,860
that we're packing people that it's a
dotnet application so they use visual

263
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,899
studio as their ide you know we start
making assumptions about how do they

264
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,950
work

265
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,650
what are you doing what is their ID
provide them what is their language

266
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,000
provides that I come from a dotnet
background I've been doing . net since

267
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,420
the beta release in $MONTH 2001 so when
I look at an aspx app I mean anything

268
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,910
that asp.net we talk about web forms we
talk about MVC right I understand what

269
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,300
they're doing to build that I understand
what it builds out-of-the-box I

270
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,570
understand what they have to do on top
of it and so when I go attack an

271
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,919
application and I know where I want to
look because the typical fit pitfalls of

272
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,970
we're gonna miss that just like most
common network people when they come in

273
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,810
they know the pit bal they know you got
corners over here because as a network

274
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,710
guy i cut corners over there you know
and so as you start to understand this

275
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,970
you start to be quicker and more
efficient at doing that attending

276
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:44,730
developer specific conferences anybody
any development work around here one RBI

277
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,510
means a couple I mean not common right I
don't want to put the name out there

278
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,620
because the project beat up in the
parking lot the guy comes developer you

279
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,429
don't see a lot and vice versa you go to
developer conferences you don't see a

280
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,900
lot of security people there so you know
the more we can get out now we're

281
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,190
starting to see more like job of one and
and some of those you know big

282
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,940
conferences are some some people start
actually getting pushing out right but

283
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,530
you're not seeing a lot of security
people going out the whole hua ab sec or

284
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,700
app conferences right and you see some
but it's not like we normally see

285
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,030
so if we start getting out attending
some of those and start talking with

286
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,240
people and saying hey I'm not here to
say your baby's ugly

287
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,660
good luck right it's not we could work
with you I don't know everything right

288
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,650
it's okay proud to say that but at the
same time we won't let them know we're

289
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:40,050
here to help not to be an adversary i'm
going to local meetup actually just

290
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,220
started recently doing this we're going
to like you know go to meetup.com or

291
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,990
whatever it

292
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,400
find local groups that part 2 i'm more
like the local dev conference i went to

293
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,059
i made a difference you know going in
and talking about security because as

294
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,129
you talk to developers about security

295
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,540
you'll actually find their interests
know about it they want to know they

296
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,629
want to write security because they want
to write the best app just like we take

297
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,740
pride in our work they take pride in
there so they want to do this but again

298
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,559
we separate ourselves so we're over here
talking they're over here talking I i

299
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,720
gave the concept a few years ago you
know but it's like high school dance and

300
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,840
nobody wants to cross into the middle
and actually start talking to each other

301
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,580
and we find that once we start doing
that when we can get it across but we do

302
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,500
in a positive way of doing things like
webinar I'm getting out there watching

303
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,950
some devil webinars you know what is it
keeping up with what they're doing

304
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,700
I've never even heard of electron until
I went to that conference and I watched

305
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,150
through and open this is cool and the
first thing I thought up with and it's

306
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,510
got to be some cool way to hack this
there's gotta be something going on

307
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,010
right one of the security deal with
electron around it and lo and behold if

308
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,070
you actually go out to the electron
website he goes to a search for google

309
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,070
work electron you have to the website
they actually have a link for security

310
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,300
and they've got a small little lift that
sense you shouldn't do that you

311
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,280
shouldn't do this shouldn't give you do
this you're on your own right we're

312
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,980
actually starting to see them put some
stuff out there

313
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,960
the question is how do we get more that
Ruby does it go out and look at ruby on

314
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,650
rails they have a guide out there that
talks about security for their systems

315
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,620
but we're still not doing a very good
job getting that information out

316
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,928
different names actually see it but even
so it's still just important for us how

317
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:27,410
many people that have tested Ruby app
from an applique made you a second here

318
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:34,250
and hopefully something to do you go out
and test this right and then I i come

319
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,429
from a company that we tested everything
I didn't matter what it was somebody

320
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,050
want a pen test you test it

321
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,059
ah but you're gonna go out and test a
ruby side you got look these guys that

322
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:46,879
part of your information gathering to
say let me go see what's common about

323
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,710
Ruby or you just go in there fire every
verb roxy is just hard hammer away at

324
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,890
the side you're going on this and that's
common stuff and how to go

325
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,400
it actually makes a difference if we
start understanding what

326
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,090
languages are using with frameworks
they're using and if we start building

327
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,770
into that now we get inside we can
actually give them a better result

328
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,580
because now I'm saying I understand what
you're going to be like me going out

329
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,610
there and saying look at the linux box
on a windows box but i only know one of

330
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,360
them and I'm not gonna look up the other
so i'll just run by same scams and all

331
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,449
around the same stop and we'll get the
same results and i missed the whole

332
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,470
bunch of stuff clinic or differently the
windows right and that's what we're

333
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,580
looking at here so as we start to
understand what development doing we

334
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,389
start to get better at how we're testing
and not only better we get faster right

335
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,690
you build up the templates we get much
more efficient

336
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,740
I'm gonna stop i can find very quickly
going through an application compared to

337
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,510
people that arms as good at development
or understanding the background of it

338
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,170
I mean it's crazy the difference you can
see some time it was interesting i was

339
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,490
at a company watching and another guy
doing network penthouse guy was amazing

340
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:58,070
i mean this guy had command line he knew
what he was running and i'll tell you if

341
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:02,179
i'm doing a network pen test because I
focus mostly on app you know i'm looking

342
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,290
up commands it but I do with this yeah
ok you know we can get through with

343
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:11,330
bumblefoot I mean that he's pounding out
commands like it's nobody's business and

344
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,409
you know I'm like that's awesome that's
exactly how I feel when I do web stuff

345
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,250
you know I know exactly what I'm doing
I'm not doing as much searching right

346
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,550
because that's my knowledge of eight but
then you go look at the same person that

347
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,300
goes into the webcast and you look at
the results you're like obviously this

348
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:32,690
doesn't work out because he has a lot of
stuff that went up right and so as we

349
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,110
start to learn more about it we get
better than applying these things

350
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,729
the other thing we need to look at is
scoping you know we talked about scope

351
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,530
all the time I know red team and
penetration testers you know we want to

352
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,920
say we're just like the attacker we
don't want any rules want to build

353
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,280
whatever we can I want to build test
whenever I can I want to build a dude

354
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,840
boss I want to do anything I can to get
into the site but as we know this is not

355
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,980
the reality right we don't get to do
that I've got an engagement coming up

356
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,330
they told me get tested night whatever
i'll test it i don't care

357
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,940
doesn't really matter to me it opens up
my day but it doesn't matter i told him

358
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,910
look my testing you're not going to feel
like I don't run a lot of automated

359
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,980
canna so i'm not going to bring down my
very manual testing but I'm not gonna

360
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,780
argue about you want to tonight

361
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,129
purple doin alright but understanding
more than understanding what's in scope

362
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,090
what applications are you testing what
applications that they have how many

363
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,199
times have you gone and everybody got
mobile app now that you know relate to

364
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,880
their web apps are you testing them both
at the same time I find most places

365
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,300
they'll do a mobile application pen tap
and then they'll do a web application

366
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,700
and then I do anything the ipad right
but they do with different times but

367
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,050
I've seen it i use work i mean like I'm
willing to admit the failures i have as

368
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,730
a developer and they were planning
especially when it comes to security the

369
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,600
head road some very insecure at that we
didn't know that at the time just a

370
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,889
disclaimer i didn't know what they were
insecure i actually wrote a nap it's

371
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:10,340
probably still live today where the
price and the cart is a hidden field and

372
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,909
you can change it if you'd like and get
the item for that price

373
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,230
so just didn't I don't run that fight
still so I don't have any obligation to

374
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,060
fix it

375
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,220
look at me like that alright but it's
out there but I work for another company

376
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,770
where we have webforms winforms mobile
device right we had a whole bunch of

377
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,550
stuff around it and what we found was
the web guy did a great job of input

378
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,480
validation you couldn't get cross-site
scripting past him productive right me

379
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,400
he locked it down a perfect didn't show
up when encoding we learned that real

380
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,320
quick because the mobile guys did not
care about what they took him they

381
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,960
didn't care about cross-site scripting
input because it wasn't a problem for

382
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,820
that you know this is back on the wind
ze days so there was no web browsing

383
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,250
through it it was a windy form can cross
that script app so it was nothing to put

384
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,660
malicious code into the mobile app and
cause cross-site scripting in the web

385
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,670
app but how many times like I said that
we actually go tasking like yeah we'll

386
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,810
do a mobile test this week will do the
website this week what we have done

387
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,190
those at different times

388
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,550
I'm not gonna see that not going to see
the correlation because I'm not going

389
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:23,210
back into the website that fit or I'm
not doing something in the website to

390
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,950
see if the mobile site there

391
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,720
I'm not testing the API that everything
is hitting to see how it worked right so

392
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,400
this becomes a concern

393
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,660
so we have to try to push it this is an
education part on our side that we go on

394
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,440
the clients and they say we want that
pent-up ok but tell us the component of

395
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,310
your half when you actually have because
we want to test this all at once I don't

396
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,270
want to do a separate here's the reason
why and often they don't know whether

397
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,290
the biggest don't think about it that
way so as we start thinking about that

398
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,300
then we start to understand

399
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,870
oh yeah we should really test these at
Sam and i'll fight with people you test

400
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,830
these at think you're really losing out
of value if we don't test these at the

401
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:06,560
same time what is our timeline for
testing center will talk about and being

402
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,970
descriptive i'm in that because we
really want to think about how long do

403
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,570
we test for that's a concern of time to
test for like a week

404
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,010
couple days maybe and then our reports
often times are not descriptive both

405
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,720
those we'll talk a little bit more about
something I often get asked should we

406
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,380
have stores Kodar pentest you see a lot
of people out there now talking about

407
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,970
source code assisted pen testing and I
seen that i'm seeing some people talk

408
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,410
about on twitter another few companies
that really pushed for it as a matter of

409
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,110
fact we'll go far enough that if they
find stuff they let you create patches

410
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,219
and give them to you

411
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:47,090
I don't know about that look a little
over-the-top and little risky but should

412
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,649
you have it to me that the question it's
kind of difficult to answer because i

413
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,170
don't think a lot of people can actually
look at the source code understand it

414
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,950
enough to be able to make it useful
right and so we want to make sure that

415
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,670
our cats are useful so if you're doing
app testing if you're not a developer

416
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,380
use a nap tester looking at source
that's gonna help but maybe you don't

417
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:11,150
pick up some simple stuff but it can
also be a sink of your time because I

418
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,790
calm and i'm really not find anything on
the web

419
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,159
we're going to look at the source if i
can find something to trying to scrape

420
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,160
through and find stop and maybe you
don't understand how to pray more to

421
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,300
work out if you can even get your hands
on the source code a lot of places won't

422
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,200
share it but it could take you away
right we always talk about the

423
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,750
methodology for pen testing and you know
that kind of five-minute five try rule

424
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:36,640
I don't want to get caught over here and
then miss testing the whole site same

425
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,330
thing if you actually have source code
brought into it is what am I going to

426
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,510
dance because inevitably if I got source
code

427
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,270
hopefully you're thinking and let me go
look at the log in as the other store in

428
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,570
the passwords because i can't tell them
outside you let me go see how they're

429
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,169
doing this if it's easy ways to bypass
anyone finding out that you didn't spend

430
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,820
enough time naturally testing the
application did this kind of have sided

431
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,899
code review you know it's always
interesting to me I wrote up some

432
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,710
recruiters you always say hey we need
abstract people and I want a knapsack

433
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,850
person that can do

434
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,290
pentesting and secure code review and
you know all these bangs and I'm like

435
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,790
does your kind of two different things
and a lot of us a really good pentesting

436
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:21,820
secure code reviews hard it's not easy i
did your code review for a company for a

437
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,659
year

438
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,950
we're always did and there's a lot you
have to tell even today

439
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:33,040
still I'll do code review but only for
dotnet because I know . that I don't

440
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,550
know java i can write a little tough job
but I don't know all the ins and outs I

441
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:40,389
know the ins and outs . bet that if i
change this configuration file it will

442
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,530
affect this over here this way right so
we talk about it i look at those and I'm

443
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,320
like so what you're really saying is you
want somebody to run the static analysis

444
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,490
tool and and give us a report but they
don't want to come out actually say that

445
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,290
but we got to be cautious

446
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:58,990
yes sir . at stake

447
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,800
no I have not I'll check that out

448
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,980
I so if you're going to do the source
code stuff just make sure that you're

449
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,440
aware there's some pitfalls around that
you don't want to get caught in to

450
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,140
increase timeline

451
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,890
this is something to talk about a lot
you know I got kind of fed up with the

452
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,670
whole week testing time frame you know
I'm trying to slam through it only got a

453
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:25,480
week to do stop you know i miss out on
so much think about how much you learn

454
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,550
in 30 days or think about how much you
learned in 60 day so a lot of what I do

455
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,370
now is I push for people and say hey
look you know what left onto a week

456
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,659
tablets your 30-day town and i'm not
saying i'm testing for eight hours a day

457
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,010
/ 30 day

458
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,000
what I'm saying is we're going to test
over 30 days and that gives us a lot of

459
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,460
flexibility in what we're doing

460
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,289
it helps build our collaboration about
what we're doing right and it helps

461
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:56,049
improve that knowledge transfer I've got
one client that when we test will do a

462
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:57,399
30 day tasks

463
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:02,709
every week we get onto our call a
webinar or a gotomeeting or whatever

464
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,770
right and will actually sit there and go
through

465
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,470
hey here's what we're currently seeing
they actually helped a little bit too

466
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,370
they work with me on it but we go
through what are we seeing and we

467
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,449
actually had where he had identified
something because we have two more

468
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:22,539
testing mobile but he was on the side
but he found the mobile he's had a code

469
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:25,929
in it that was important to us and so
he's like a check this out

470
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:29,860
and so we look at it Trina we're going
back and forth and he's a guy can do

471
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,309
this with this code but i'm not really
sure where to go and have a great idea

472
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:37,418
how we try this and we start working
through it and probably 30 minutes in we

473
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:43,120
were able to go from a self registered
user to a full admin user on that web

474
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,779
account based on the information found
right it was through i'm walking through

475
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:51,010
and it was great because you know we're
looking at a lot of stuff he found

476
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:55,750
something we get to go through it but
he's also learning as well but he seemed

477
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,159
different ways we look at it as he
wouldn't have put together over here to

478
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,700
over there right and so as we look
through it we talk about it right we

479
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,649
worked together so the collaboration is
great there's lots of ways we could do

480
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:12,039
it right mean one allows us to do more
but we can use things like black

481
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:16,929
anybody's black seems like it's coming
pretty popular now depending on your

482
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:20,620
fear of security levels and all that
stuff you know how much you want to put

483
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:25,209
through slack or something that's up to
you and your client but you slack to

484
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:31,659
stay in touch using something like skype
or other microsoft technologies i put

485
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:36,010
microsoft on there for things like
onedrive and I share a lot of documents

486
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:41,830
through office 365 a look at the report
as we're building it you go in and see

487
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,460
see what we're doing now if there's
things you have concerns about we can

488
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,510
address them right away you know but it
allows us to be interactive using things

489
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:54,309
that go to meeting or webex some of
those things we get on together and talk

490
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:58,059
about things and these things really
help kind of build that bond that I'm

491
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:58,350
not

492
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,949
here test real i'm here to work with you
and help you get through this

493
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:07,650
transparency you know getting more out
there

494
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,289
one of the things I was always
frustrated with when I was on the

495
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:13,679
receiving end of reports don't know
really what you're doing yes I see what

496
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,460
you found and I see some screenshots
that you burp to do it or if the network

497
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:22,530
test I see screenshots that use this
tool but you're not really giving me a

498
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,559
whole lot of detail about what are you
really doing to get this stuff so

499
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,340
helping them understand more of hey I
use this and this is the reason why i

500
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,449
use this tool right share ideas that
failed

501
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,130
hey you know when i tried this it didn't
work it's okay to not get something to

502
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,700
work let me know the stuff you're trying
because the more than we tell them about

503
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,650
how we tasked the more they start to
understand how they can look at their

504
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,669
house internally or how they can share
that with the developers or how our

505
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:55,080
thought process works that they can
share that out with the developers and

506
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,350
people start understanding a business
how they're looking at your house

507
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,908
these are the things they're trying and
a great job you didn't fall for this one

508
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:06,690
but you fell for this right and then
understanding why is it that you felt

509
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,570
for one and not the other is because
your framework protects against that

510
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,590
automatically write a lot of these view
engines now do a great job across

511
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,790
scripting lot of them you know they have
a lot of stuff is great for protecting

512
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,679
its sequel injection but that doesn't
mean developers to that on purpose that

513
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,010
was just luck of the draw right let me
know it like that you know hey look is

514
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,290
this is what we're saving you here

515
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:32,310
keep in mind that book working you know
understanding your frameworks to do that

516
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,600
are in creating these learning
opportunities and why did you use that

517
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,500
tool

518
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,330
I mean this is again is a relationship
you're forming it shouldn't just be a

519
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:48,210
black box test that we bring it through
here i mentioned the flexibility

520
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,659
how many times have you had when you got
to the site and they're like all right

521
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,919
we're going to start on monday and you
don't start till wednesday because they

522
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,879
didn't have credentials or the site
wasn't up there was some problem there

523
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,859
was a family emergency or what

524
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:07,020
whatever it may be but what happens when
you don't start till wednesday you still

525
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,400
finish on friday rapid

526
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,350
I've got other clients lined up I'm not
waiting I don't get to move you over so

527
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:17,830
you just now got yourself a three-day
test right and that's not good for

528
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,520
anybody

529
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,580
wow I guess it's good for our pocket
right but it's really not good for

530
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,620
anybody so extending that out saying hey
look you know what let's put more time

531
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,370
behind this

532
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:30,640
let's build this up with have some
flexibility that something happened i

533
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,200
lock out my credentials I typically
don't do help block out that stuff until

534
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,270
the end but not everybody works the same
lock out your credentials

535
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,930
how long's that take them to get that
you don't even care you know it's gonna

536
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,160
take a couple hours to unlock my upline
we got 30 days we got think that

537
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,109
whatever we got time

538
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,200
you don't have the diagrams ready on the
first day

539
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,890
no worry I've got questions about how
the site working because I found

540
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,370
something and maybe I want a piece of
source code you know that i do that

541
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,069
laughter hey can you send me the source
code for this because it seemed to be

542
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,660
acting weird

543
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,370
it takes you two days to get it to me
network network right I'm not eating in

544
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,040
and think you have to stop every time I
say something

545
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,360
stop what you're doing and go visit to
help us all out any type of emergency

546
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,590
changes they're pushing waiting on the
document and they all create kind of a

547
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:25,750
whole they can't get out of improving
our knowledge transfer this is something

548
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,310
where we start doing some videos and i
know some other companies that do videos

549
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,060
as well that when you find a good
exploit you video it so that example I

550
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:39,279
talked about where we went from the
mobile app to full admin on the web we

551
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,780
did video for that it was a four-minute
video we also did a story about the

552
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,550
story also click all right of a story

553
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:49,480
alright of them are you able to record a
video and it will make sure that people

554
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,520
understand the true cause behind this
and what it does is it showed that

555
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,960
impact right when i did the video that
showed grabbing that value and go into

556
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,880
full admin self registering account all
within four minutes in a video real time

557
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,280
I made a huge impact from what they look
at that versus be writing it up as a

558
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,780
story which i did I didn't get any grace
for that right my god whatever great

559
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,460
story to read all that anyway they
watched the video I watched a lot right

560
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,150
and they understood it and they said I'd
now I see it really only take this

561
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:26,470
much effort to go from here to here
we're going to fix this ASAP to give

562
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,980
that real-time feel to it because
otherwise i can read the stories like oh

563
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,869
yeah sure you know you grab that you did
but it probably took you hours to do

564
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:37,930
that piece and then you have to go do
that as a no

565
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:42,940
really these five steps and they happen
like that that's getting people to

566
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,750
understand that that's how really works
that we can get through this pretty

567
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:52,210
quickly online meetings like i said i
like to use them just to check in go

568
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:55,750
over what we're seeing because it helps
me learn about the application or too

569
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:59,980
many people when they do a nap test or
any type of test like that right sit

570
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,730
down and actually do a walk through the
application with the company so they can

571
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:08,319
tell you this is how it works right with
it anyway I'll get interesting . i'll

572
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:12,339
let you know right so you can do some of
these meetings you can build that up a

573
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:18,400
little bit one I actually find that as i
do these meetings are out have my report

574
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,049
becomes more of a deliverable then it
does the really the gold of the whole

575
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:26,470
thing write my report is more of a
document what we've already talked about

576
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:30,308
you already know about it there's
chances you could have fixed it already

577
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:33,549
if you wanted to before we even finished
testing

578
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:37,390
I'm kidding i like the 30 day test
myself but there are other companies

579
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:41,020
that are pushing for longer testing .
right you can still do multiple tasks

580
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,369
and how many ppl double-booked anyway
right this way I don't feel so bad about

581
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:49,029
it i actually don't like double booked
but with a 30 day because it is a

582
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:56,440
spread-out thing I blood to do 32 time
if we have to getting our reporting this

583
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,529
kind of where that whole bench thing
came up right are reporting works it

584
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:03,940
gets it out there but how many times you
think of going in to test a network you

585
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,930
tested application this year and you
know next year when you go back it's

586
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,759
going to be the same findings same stop
right nothing really happened with it

587
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,510
because what we do we go out with
findings in their we put an executive

588
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,109
summary

589
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:21,759
here's what we found its great record it
might make it to the dev team it might

590
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,569
make it to this is admin team it might
make it in a different form we don't

591
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:28,930
know why but I mean I get frustrated
when i go back and see the same

592
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,710
vulnerability if they're high-low
vulnerability whatever their well that

593
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,210
but the high ones make a difference

594
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:40,760
so getting better reporting out of it I
know nobody like the reporting phase .

595
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,140
the second part of pen testing but this
is where we give a lot of information

596
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:51,020
over so enhancing our methodology and
talk about ok instances vs findings

597
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,230
something that I find a lot of people
don't understand how many times does

598
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,800
matter what it is right i mean even
network like I said a lot of stuff

599
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,630
transpose it back and forth i give you a
report and I say you've got cross-site

600
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,320
scripting right that's a finding across
the cooking

601
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,190
well then I break it down to give you a
few instances here's some examples of

602
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,690
process gripping your site and so what
do they do they get the report to go

603
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:18,680
back to fix the instances but they
didn't really understand why they had

604
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,649
cross-site scripting right they went in
and fix those ones that you pointed out

605
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,040
and what do we do we come back and say
oh you pick some cross-site scripting is

606
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,720
gone man i'll find more next year
because we didn't actually identify the

607
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,589
rooftop

608
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:34,880
but if we start helping them identify
this and say and instead of just saying

609
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,890
hey this is rampant across the whole
site

610
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:41,868
hey you've got cross-site scripting and
you know i'm noticing a common thing

611
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:45,410
right using labels in your application
and you're not including those out go

612
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:49,098
out and look for those things right and
then updating our findings and getting

613
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:55,400
those squared away something I was here
they can't reproduce laws right that's a

614
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,369
common concern and it's frustrating

615
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:01,220
I have clients that tell me the reason
I'm calling is because their last

616
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,080
company they can't reproduce cloth

617
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,848
I'm so where the reproducibility i say
i'm a consumable steps make a detailed

618
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:10,820
don't assume they know what you're doing

619
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,660
it's very difficult like me talking to
my wife had no idea what that i'm

620
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:21,319
talking about makes perfect sense to me
doesn't work well as far as the details

621
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,480
right instead of being generic well okay
here's cross-site scripting and you

622
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,960
could steal cookies and you could do
this and here's a general abstract about

623
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,589
cross-site scripting that's great and
all but what if we actually start

624
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:37,460
getting into it was a halo coming to
talk about the details right I've got

625
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,470
cross-site scripting and your session
cookie doesn't have HTTP only enable and

626
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:48,740
so now my narrative cross-site scripting
and I can steal your session ID

627
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:53,689
and send it off to my server and login
as your user it kind of goes back to

628
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,380
that adversarial mapping p for things
like it's not just the cross-site

629
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,920
scripting I've heard your box the show
it works it's just a proof of concept

630
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,440
that so i can steal your session cookie
and this is why it really bad this is

631
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,670
why you're fixing this not just because
I come across because to be honest with

632
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,770
you if you tell somebody that process
available

633
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:17,300
it's a flaw but if i can show you this
is how i would use cross-site scripting

634
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,970
now it starts to make sense

635
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:25,279
good thing i like to talk about is
conversation starters so instead of just

636
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,210
doing our general recommendations and
this is kind of in addition to

637
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,440
recommendations

638
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,400
this is a way for us to say you know
what security rarely involved during the

639
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,630
design phase of our application we
always say we want to do it we hire apps

640
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,220
that people so they get into the fplc
know they live in security connectivity

641
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:48,410
right but here's our chances hey here's
hoping to get back involved with it here

642
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:52,819
is that we get the design discussion
going and look back and maybe do threat

643
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,420
modeling what if you want to call it
that you're doing to do this but allows

644
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,650
us to circle back around so I had this
example this was one of my clients that

645
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:05,210
they had using harvesting and they have
a status code that come back now the

646
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:08,630
error message was the same there's no
issue with the error message but they

647
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,230
have the status could come back and that
was a problem so i could easily say hey

648
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,130
we've got using harvesting it so
typically what we'll do is we'll say hey

649
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,400
don't return you know return a generic
error message that simple and even in

650
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,290
this case we could get rid of sadness
but is that really good recommendation

651
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,869
you don't even know how that application
work I don't know what that buses or

652
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:33,380
they probably don't know what's right
but I can't just say don't do this as a

653
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,070
poor way to do it and he's end up they
turn into like more coaching just it's

654
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:40,880
kind of fun actually but what if you
actually go in there and say hey I

655
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,880
recommend that you review the sign of
your login functionality and talk with

656
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,140
the developers of what are you trying to
do here what the status code for how do

657
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,190
you use that pepco do you need the
static scope if you don't need the

658
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,820
status code can we get rid of it if you
do need the status code what are the

659
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,720
other mitigations we can look at

660
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,970
to help us reduce the username
harvesting floor we have but we're

661
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,640
coming out as a positive hey I want to
work with you

662
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,868
we found that there's a blah let's talk
about it but let's not just talk about

663
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:13,710
the flaw

664
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,450
let's look at the log in right you find
an issue with forgot password

665
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:22,710
let's look at your forgot password let's
talk about what you're doing here and

666
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:27,660
say here's how we look at this right now
you're doing your tact reason your trade

667
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,520
model with them and now has a pen tester
of your external you're not actually

668
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,320
doing it right but you're pushing the
idea and the notion of doing it into the

669
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,820
reports and say hey this is what you
guys should be doing and then now that's

670
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,359
getting spread out through management of
their whoever sees that report now in

671
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,170
their base

672
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,980
hey I should be thinking about that
let's not just look at the cross-site

673
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,359
scripting incidents and go put encoding
out there let's think about why we have

674
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:58,348
cross-site scripting why do we have been
harvested let's talk about these feature

675
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:01,619
let's see if there's any other things
that maybe didn't come up in the report

676
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:06,599
I mean there might be other login issues
that they have made it wouldn't find but

677
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:10,410
when you go and actually hey let's start
talking about your thing are you coming

678
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,330
out and saying I'm here to help

679
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,810
I'm not here to tell you how you get
laws in your app and I'll see you later

680
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:19,710
let me know when you figure those out
that that's not going to work as we go

681
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:26,070
forward so you know really kind of wrap
things up you know it's more than

682
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,290
testing we've got to be more than
testing

683
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:31,470
I mean if we actually want to make
changes security we actually have to

684
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,470
think about how can we do that we have
to make it happen

685
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,790
we talked about we want better secure
apps a lot better secure network who

686
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,420
stopped to a default password the
hard-coded password and all these

687
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,940
different things we want this change but
what I'm seeing as our reports that

688
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,300
we're currently doing the way we're
going about it doesn't do it I say the

689
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,380
same thing among how we say developers
need training you know home and

690
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,770
developers think they need more training
but the people that are doing the

691
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,520
training around the red teamers don't
know anything about development but we

692
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,259
know about attacking and we teach them
this how you attack and then generically

693
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:10,650
wow this is how you could hypothetically
protect against them

694
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,089
that's not working right so if we want
to actually get changed out there how

695
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:19,410
can we do it we can start by looking at
how we do our fantastic agents and say

696
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,040
look we're here to help were here to
fight through the we want to get you

697
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,140
moving and these are some ways that I
think we can take to do that and as I

698
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,000
said it worked really well with the
clients that I've had they really like

699
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,080
the concept that we're putting here
getting more involved if you're

700
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,670
concerned about the idea that well
pentesting should be kind of a nobody

701
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:46,380
knows about it right in network it makes
more sense i don't want to sock to know

702
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,160
because i want to see if they pick this
stuff up but at the same time we do kind

703
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,310
of want them to work with us because hey
i just sent this stuff did you see it

704
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,120
you know if there's a fine line there
but keep in mind when we talk about

705
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,640
applications here the developers not
watching that

706
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,259
so it's okay to help development and say
hey look we want to involve with this

707
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,130
want to make you aware they want to
learn they want to do it they like

708
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:13,590
figuring stuff out like we do so if we
can identify who the right people to get

709
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:18,870
involved we can actually maybe start
getting more understanding out there and

710
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,290
hopefully we'll start getting more
security and we won't start seeing the

711
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:29,970
same low-hanging nonsense stop that
we're seeing every day so that's it for

712
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:32,970
me

713
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:58,590
I so the question is you have done stuff
with fusion team we're going to

714
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,740
dedicated people from certain areas i
haven't done a lot with that but that's

715
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:06,240
what I'm trying to get the goal here is
to identify the right resources are

716
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,240
going to make a difference if we do the
testing

717
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:26,670
yeah certain any other questions yet so
the question is you know do for app

718
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,780
reviews or desktop indicator on
authenticated I test authenticated I

719
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,200
know there's a question about that right
you know well you know it's beer true

720
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,759
attacker quite honestly a lot of two
attackers have accounts most of these

721
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,720
accounts are open but you're missing out
on so much you don't have a count if I

722
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,049
unauthenticated most likely I'm gonna
spend the time trying to just pack your

723
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,720
login screen and that's a waste of money

724
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,470
most of applause that was here not the
login alright the flaws that we're

725
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:56,490
seeing are these logic blog where I can
go and manipulate hidden field or you

726
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:59,970
know you're missing authorization that
I'm a regular user and I can access

727
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:03,750
admin features that type of stuff and
without authenticated testing you're not

728
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:08,040
going to get that type of testing you
know so I I like authenticated I won't

729
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:19,170
do not authenticated testing that it
seems that way yeah so I don't fix my

730
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:23,580
keep that separate because i don't want
it to be a conflict so the question you

731
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:27,840
know did I ever have anybody that asks
me to fix the flaws that i find i try to

732
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:33,240
stay out of that space i will certainly
I yeah I mean people will ask you know

733
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,899
you seen some companies will start doing
it but a lot of people they want to stay

734
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,490
separate right I'm on this side because
if i start centers and hey look I charge

735
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:47,819
you to help fix these well then I'm
gonna start a whole bunch of with it

736
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:52,590
yeah right you know I'm indeed it's a
sticky situation to get into but I've

737
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:56,010
got no problem working with them and
saying this is what will work i had a

738
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:59,610
cross-site scripting father came through
that was not going through angular for

739
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:04,350
template injection you know we're using
square brackets instead of your typical

740
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,610
less than greater than and I actually
did a write-up saying this is exactly

741
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:12,870
what the problem is you need to remove
the bracket right i mean it was very

742
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,410
clear what they should do but I'm not
getting into your cut like that's a

743
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:20,640
whole different insurance issue that I
don't want with your part up but i have

744
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,330
no problem you know i mean i will share
my opinions I'm not afraid to say

745
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,799
something in the fact that what you said
I should do this yeah i mean i said you

746
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:37,680
should do it but I'm not responsible at
the crack tip that so anything up now

747
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,509
perfect but I think everybody for coming
early in the morning for notes it

748
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,250
releases later than usual

749
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,320
ten o'clock not too bad
