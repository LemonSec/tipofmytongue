1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:34,800
let me do all right who held that twelve
o'clock on the dot

2
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:48,510
yeah greater because Juan my boss is
presenting next door we can do better

3
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,350
than that

4
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,350
greater begun

5
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:05,430
thank you hear that Jay my folks better
than yours are all right enough fun

6
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,339
alright so take good morning but it's
now afternoon it's one minute past noon

7
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,630
to be exact

8
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,490
welcome to I don't give one iota by
introducing the Internet of Things

9
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,380
attack methodology

10
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,429
i'm larry Pesci you get to listen to me
for the next 15 minutes

11
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,570
I'm so sorry alright little bit about me

12
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,990
who's your daddy what does he do wait I
didn't say that right that's ok I my

13
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,250
director of research and senior
management consultant and in guardians

14
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,530
that means I'm hacker of all the things
to the best of my ability I do a lot of

15
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:50,610
pentesting management stuff hardware
hacking radio you name it i'm also an

16
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,229
author with syngress in the past I do a
lot of podcasting Paul security weekly

17
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,939
for those who maybe have listened once
or twice we've only been doing it

18
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,979
oh we're going to our 11th year so i'm
also apparently really bad at selfies

19
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,419
and just juxtaposition is important
apparently so

20
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,630
alright

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,250
alright so i want to give you a little
bit of background on what this whole IOT

22
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,120
thing is at we probably have a really
good idea what it is

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,990
so maybe a little bit of preaching to
the choir but I want to make sure that

24
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,350
we're sort of all on the same playing
field and do a little little little bit

25
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,579
of level set

26
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,880
ok so National Institute of Standards
says according one of their documents

27
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:40,750
but what is the IOT i love that what is
V IOT not what is io t is what is the

28
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,670
IOT seems kinda weird to me

29
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,359
there are many ways to describe the IOT
more than 20 professional research

30
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,820
groups have worked to characterize the
IOT but so far there's no one

31
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,160
universally accepted definition

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:06,880
ok I tend to agree a little bit so for
me the history of IOT it its not New we

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,220
think when I think I OT I think back to
when I was in organization and had to

34
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:19,870
deal with embedded devices printers
alarm systems all these sex toys

35
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:26,320
well they weren't in my organization
much ok but render I'm glad you brought

36
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,880
all of your sex toys with you

37
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,090
okay okay can we play with the no never
mind

38
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:38,530
alright so cameras there were all these
single purpose computers that were

39
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,730
really difficult to secure they required
patching and no one had them in their

40
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,329
patch management programs it was used a
nightmare

41
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,240
this stuff is still around however we're
lumping more and more into that same

42
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,470
category of code embedded devices and as
a result we've started to have to change

43
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:02,440
that definition again more from NIST
there is no formal analytic or even

44
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,829
descriptive set of building blocks that
govern the operation to us to

45
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,980
trustworthiness and lifecycle of IOT
components

46
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:16,539
yikes alright so i think they decided to
fix that I said just recently just

47
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:23,260
released a special publication 823 which
defines a various

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,840
and so I OT including a sensor
aggregator communication channel

49
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,419
external utility and a decision trigger
the what is that that's really

50
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:43,030
descriptive no okay they're describing
IOT at very much a high level and not

51
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,059
really distilling it down into a lot of
the technical components they've

52
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:53,110
included some technical portion but for
me it's it's not quite there

53
00:04:53,110 --> 00:05:01,840
ok they've more described how things
connect as opposed to and connect on a

54
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,289
very limited scale as opposed to it all
right

55
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:08,530
they actually described it as a network
of things so they're describing the

56
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,679
network as opposed to you know the
devices themselves

57
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,139
ok so with little fanfare the first
Internet of Things model has been

58
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,000
published by the national institute of
standards

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,129
yeah without fanfare go figure how many
of you seen 823 I rest my case

60
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:29,740
ok very few alright as the folks who set
the standard for smart grid operator up

61
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,770
interoperability in recent years the new
model is an important step into finding

62
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,020
exactly what the IOT is the IOT is and
outlining necessary security standards

63
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,250
that go along with it

64
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,169
could this be the catalyst needed to
help drive the emerging IOT market

65
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:49,359
market not IOT security market
interesting

66
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,599
ok it certainly doesn't hurt

67
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:55,779
hmm yeah it doesn't hurt no more

68
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:00,219
the wonderful thing about standards is
that we have so many of them that

69
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:05,349
alright so my definition I'm definitely
agreement with sort of mists five

70
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,840
different components but as a security
professional they don't go into nearly

71
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,638
enough technical detail and described
enough of what i need to potentially

72
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,500
start penetration testing or securing
any of these types of devices i think

73
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,029
about the more technical components in
them the the items that make up some of

74
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:30,370
these solutions such as mobile devices
web servers the actual devices

75
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,440
themselves all those other pieces
described maybe a little bit better

76
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:41,389
or for us as a security group that we
understand these devices opposed to

77
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:46,610
what's a data aggregator and add sensor
and some of those other really obscure

78
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,139
terms that they picked up

79
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:51,379
ok so from start to finish

80
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:57,680
I think a lot of people forget about
what makes up an IOT solution me it's

81
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,370
not just about the piece of hardware
that you hang on your wall that's a

82
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,020
thermostat now it's a whole series of
interconnected devices that make up a

83
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,889
massive ecosystem think about that for a
second

84
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,900
you know it for those of you who got to
go see EDS talked earlier I so yeah

85
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,349
yesterday and is describing all the
components in his steampunk office and i

86
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:25,940
think i'd mentioned cloud number of
times he mentioned devices and web

87
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,650
services and it's not just about the
dice you hang on your wall there's so

88
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,770
many other pieces and parts from a
technical perspective that we need to

89
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,609
consider

90
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:41,870
ok so what is this market look like why
do we care about IOT security this is

91
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,889
not a problem that is going well this is
not a benefit that is going to go away

92
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,789
anytime soon i love all of my
internet-connected stuff in fact I want

93
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:54,680
to do more of it you know I aspire to
have heads office sir

94
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,610
serie activate red alert that was
awesome

95
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,779
yeah we are becoming more and more
connected everywhere all the time i come

96
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:10,340
from a time when the first organization
I that really serious organization i

97
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,919
went to work for I that if you wanted
access to internet and email get to fill

98
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,279
out a form and request it and provide
justification

99
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:25,069
yeah internet was a privilege not a
right now access to the internet

100
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:30,259
everywhere and all the time is a right
not a privilege and people get really

101
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,839
upset when it's slow like on an airplane
like internet on an airplane that's

102
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,419
amazing

103
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:45,010
I didn't even have to fill out a form
and ultimately start thinking about some

104
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,790
of the things that these IOT devices
have got there they're giving it up

105
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,269
they're gonna give us ultimate physical
control over our environment through

106
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:53,920
some sort of technology

107
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,500
this could be fascinating but not only
are they giving us physical control

108
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,630
think about the price of some of these
devices they're often relatively

109
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:09,279
inexpensive why because there's so much
data that can be aggregated from these

110
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,959
devices and shared with other folks to
do massive data mining and sharing so

111
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,849
all part of the ecosystem so what is
this market look like okay

112
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,620
the verizon state of the market from
this year the Internet of Things I rise

113
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,250
and state of the market document from
this year said more and more things

114
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,389
ranging from a remotely programmable
home thermostats and wearable health and

115
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:41,860
fitness devices to aircraft jet engines
uh and the nation's power grid who will

116
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,829
be added to the in internet everyday
devices connectivity and IT services

117
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:53,979
will make up the majority of the
projected 1.3 trillion with the tio2

118
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,890
market in 2019 1.3 trillion dollars in
IOT market

119
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,589
Jimmy start buying stocks now yeah yeah
don't short it

120
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,610
hmm ya go along

121
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,380
yeah this is this is going to get big
and I see this only going to get bigger

122
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,350
in that the devices are going to become
easier to use and they're going to

123
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,149
become wet expensive and people are
starting to start adopting them because

124
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:26,540
we're moving into a newer and newer
generation that is expecting all of this

125
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:32,180
type of stuff this is not something
that's going to go away so what happens

126
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,880
when we have all this stuff and it all
goes wrong there's tons of value in data

127
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,920
collected on the on the consumer
themselves what are my habits when do i

128
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,939
turn the heat up how often do I go
jogging I what type of food is my render

129
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,490
of my refrigerator

130
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,760
what type of messages text messages do i
get to my Apple watch the possibilities

131
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,810
are limitless

132
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:02,449
the device manager a manufacturer also
can collect all sorts of data as well as

133
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:08,779
the software developer can capture all
sorts of really fun stuff if we start

134
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:13,790
aggregating this data from multiple
sources in an IOT environment the

135
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,529
potential amount for data and directed
marketing and big data analytics becomes

136
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:27,770
unbelievably valuable I think about what
happens when my fitness tracker is

137
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,860
connected to my refrigerator that can
determine what I've taken out of the

138
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,860
refrigerator and what's in there and
what I would be for shopping list and

139
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,880
that shopping list is closed in a cloud
service it then starts talking to my

140
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,810
dating app and can determine the type of
people that I like to date married so

141
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:49,130
sorry but you know do I prefer people of
us a specific stature where I like to go

142
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,570
to eat what type of foods that I like
those restaurants the kind of beer that

143
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,709
I drink

144
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:59,689
hey through something like untapped when
i leave my house what temperature i set

145
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,550
my house at $TIME

146
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,120
where I am in my car based on gps for my
phone

147
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,420
tie it to my bathroom scale think about
tying all those things together and

148
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,860
building a profile about how Larry acts
and the type of foods that I like to eat

149
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,329
and how much exercise I get and what my
mental state may be looking like by

150
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:24,739
looking at potentially my god my
relationship status and so forth that

151
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,750
also makes a great marketing direct
marketing but what happens if that now

152
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,740
gets all aggregated to my health care
provider they can now make some

153
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,589
decisions about how much they're going
to charge me for my health insurance

154
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:42,800
potentially can make some deductions
about you know my possible health and

155
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,099
potential outcomes for some my diseases
and so forth that actually becomes

156
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,720
really frightening to me but what
happens when it really goes wrong

157
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:01,279
ok so I in Kohinoor co-author of
idiocracy actually stated that he he

158
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,029
never thought that this movie would
become a documentary if you guys haven't

159
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:07,910
seen this film it is billed as a comedy

160
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:15,260
ok go watch it it's a it's not a good
movie it's a fantastic movie it is very

161
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,029
much a documentary and he made the
authors may in fact have been a little

162
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:31,730
bit forward seeing I yeah anybody go to
starbucks this morning to get a latte

163
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,469
ok but on time for that right now you
guys like money

164
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,930
yeah I like money I'm really glad to see
we're hanging out

165
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:50,149
okay yeah yeah absolutely all right but
if this stuff is so successful like

166
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:54,890
parasites like are hundreds of millions
of IOT devices in our environment

167
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,589
why haven't parasites taken over the
world

168
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,339
it's simple they have you just don't
know it

169
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:08,259
ok that's because the successful
parasites don't kill us they become part

170
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:12,670
of us making us perform all the work to
keep them alive and reproduce

171
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:19,750
ok how many of you have listen to or
read I Damon by Daniel Suarez if you

172
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,790
haven't go do it

173
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,129
yeah awesome book daniel scott a ton of
awesome titles essentially to roll up

174
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:34,389
the the history of Damon gentleman is
very wealthy and he does a bunch of data

175
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:40,300
aggregation through some of his his
wealth through 3d printing I one-off

176
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,529
manufacturing and so forth he
essentially creates a world of internet

177
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:51,519
controlled IOT that is managed by AI and
not in a good way like motorcycles with

178
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,519
machine guns without writer that are
controlled by AI and can shoot whatever

179
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,350
the heck they darn well please

180
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,350
that sounds like a future I don't want
to be a part of

181
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,759
ok maybe one of those in dad's office
when red alert goes off

182
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:16,990
yeah well and in control of it I trust I
probably shouldn't but what about when

183
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,730
we put the computer in control

184
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:25,630
yeah that's an interesting challenge
alright let that sink in for a second

185
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,639
okay

186
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,420
the hardest part about the impending IOT
apocalypse is that pretending I'm not

187
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,439
excited because this is going to go
awesome for us as security professionals

188
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:42,639
unless we make it better so let's talk a
little bit about this whole ecosystem

189
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,910
this whole mess that is IOT the way I
see it

190
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,949
ok so it starts with the device that
does something

191
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,069
ok and then it connects to a network and
then you got a mobile app to interact

192
00:15:57,069 --> 00:16:01,719
with this thing and there's a hosted
service with a web app so that you can

193
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,930
do this in the cloud and you can manage
your device from somewhere from a

194
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,349
computer as opposed to a mobile app you
can have multiple devices tied to the

195
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,459
same account

196
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:14,829
and then they capture all sorts of data
and then they aggregate that in a

197
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:18,309
database for their own service and then
they start sharing that data with other

198
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:23,829
third-party so that we can do larger
data aggregation it's happening

199
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:30,670
ok so it starts with one thing our cute
little panda you guys seen these things

200
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:36,819
this is the at the smart toy and one of
our analyst actually has one of these

201
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:39,670
and where we're having some fun with
this

202
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:47,139
he was dubbed Operation sad panda they
make multiple versions of this bear was

203
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,860
called a monkey i have a was a monkey i
have a monkey

204
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,379
I that's not the same monkey here monkey
is not internet-connected mine is the

205
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:59,139
project is called Operation spank the
monkey

206
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:06,640
yes it get with this through render man
here has the internet of dong dgs a

207
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,770
ddong has internet of dogs

208
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:14,829
yeah wait what happens when your sex toy
talks to your dating profiles

209
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:21,959
a lot of fun doing alright so we've got
this one thing this is our IOT device

210
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,009
right

211
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:27,779
this does not act standalone then it
wouldn't be a internet or network of

212
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:28,950
things with it

213
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,749
no we've got devices that it connects to
we've got our mobile app in our wireless

214
00:17:33,749 --> 00:17:38,999
network in the internet and the cloud
and some big data aggregation services

215
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:44,220
so it turns now into this ecosystem of
many things but we have more than just

216
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,759
this one panda in our house right we
have many things many many things we've

217
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:55,080
got our thermostats and do this other
toy a doll and light light bulbs red

218
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:01,830
yep and our car chargers and are
interconnected automobiles and tire

219
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:07,949
pressure sensors and our online banking
and are smart grid and our health

220
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,220
fitness devices potentially medical
devices and they're all connected to the

221
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,590
Internet cloud in these back and data
services and then what does it look like

222
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:25,168
yeah all this stuff talks together this
is a freaking mass and these services

223
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:28,590
i'll talk to each other how we have no
idea because somebody needs to look at

224
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,359
this stuff and I actually think I going
through this am I trying to connect all

225
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,259
these dots and I think I probably forgot
a couple dozen interconnections here

226
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:47,070
like this is this is a mass ok to me
this is why testing Internet of Things

227
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,220
ecosystem not the device the entirety of
the ecosystem is super important and

228
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,239
more important than ever this is really
weird for me

229
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:03,149
no I'm most of the other toxic if it
ever given at a security conference have

230
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:06,809
been technical nature this is be
pretending to be a thought leader

231
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,980
how am i doing we wait my bosses next
door

232
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,850
how am i doing the hot leader you guys
rock

233
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,820
free beer at the bar and free bear the
bars on it

234
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,600
alright so how do we test this stuff

235
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,020
well spent some time thinking and we
really need some methodology to make

236
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,000
this happen we spent some time in
guardians years ago all that long ago

237
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,640
building a testing methodology for smart
grid let's leverage that experience and

238
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,490
build a testing methodology for the IOT
ecosystem cool how good doing good on

239
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:02,640
time right so i want to introduce to you
folks I iota this is the Internet of

240
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,620
Things attack methodology I dropped the
M because what's an Odom yeah I know

241
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:13,889
what I odie is tiny so let's talk a
little bit about the iota some of the

242
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,360
methodology components some ways we can
do some implementation and give you some

243
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,799
ideas about how you can build a lab
we're not going to go into every single

244
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,910
component we're gonna give you some
high-level ideas because this is

245
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:33,090
actually pretty darn massive and huge
and overwhelming

246
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,140
alright so I see based on sort of the
five missed areas i see five areas for

247
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,730
technology that we really need to
evaluate in IOT ecosystem we've got our

248
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,540
Hardware comprising of some firmware
running on the device radio

249
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:54,030
communications in all its States
proprietary or otherwise some Wi-Fi

250
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:59,070
Bluetooth low-energy how does this
device communicate and what does it do

251
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,740
we have some potential web app stuff for
interaction with the device we've got

252
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:11,220
some mobile apps we've got a traditional
network type of environments to deal

253
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,169
with because we're building networks to
support all that I OT stuff servers web

254
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:17,220
servers

255
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,500
routers you name it as well as all the
corporate systems that are potentially

256
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,860
interacting with all that data stuff
from accounting finance HR also director

257
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,439
fishing and then what do they do when
they start interacting with those

258
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,650
services so think about it from
necessarily the operational side of

259
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,120
house the IOT side but the IT side of
the house so if there's a company that

260
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,610
offers a IOT device for sale

261
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,469
they have business services attack those
business services to because oftentimes

262
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:52,320
they're going to be interconnected at
some point and finally api testing what

263
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,370
happens when they they're open and they
offer api testing number of years ago i

264
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,549
did some testing on some smart
thermostats as part of my talk at DEFCON

265
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,270
and in fact the API that they had the
initial version of the API allows you to

266
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:09,750
query the device / authenticated HTTP
and obtain wireless SSID and passwords

267
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,860
and if someone hadn't tested that they
would have never updated it and that's

268
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,799
that's a problem so we gotta test the
API as well

269
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,658
ok so looking at the hardware side if
this is interaction with the device go

270
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:31,919
buy one and take it apart with some
tools or hacksaw or there might you know

271
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,919
thermite's probably not going to leave
you with too much left but you get the

272
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,240
idea you gotta go take it apart and
start investigating the board startled

273
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,780
we now need some tools to start
interacting with these devices from the

274
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,590
hardware level and seeing what hardware
protocols are available whether it be

275
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:54,629
rs232 or TTL cereal jtag i2c spi look at
the data buses on the device

276
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,549
what is transferred over those data
buses a bunch of tools for us to to

277
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:03,299
potentially look at some of that type of
stuff an oscilloscope prophase aardvark

278
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:10,049
silly logic various I serial adapters
bus pirate so forth and so on

279
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,979
we also potentially need to start
looking at some of their radio

280
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,640
components with some Wi-Fi adapter
software-defined radio bluetooth dongles

281
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,850
the internet is our friend tear the
board tearing stuff apart look at chips

282
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,199
and then go look those chips up gets
product data sheets and then start

283
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,930
figuring out what the capabilities are
and/or

284
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,990
what methodologies are using onboard to
do transfer

285
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:40,500
ok go buy cheap stuff off of something
like dealextreme if you guys ever shop

286
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,650
at dealextreme alright guys are my
people

287
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,510
be careful with dealextreme you go there
cheap stuff from China sometimes here in

288
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:57,090
the US like a 7-inch android tablet $22
yeah this is cheap stuff coming from

289
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,470
China

290
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:06,900
what if it doesn't work when it gets
here $22 by six you see my problem and

291
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,570
then as you're shopping for this is like
oh hey cool i can use one of those

292
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,570
internet-connected doorbells that's four
dollars

293
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,219
what if it doesn't work it's for our spy
10

294
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:24,330
yeah you know how many tablets i have at
home like 22 tablets how many doorbells

295
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,080
you didn't way too many so next thing
you know you're checking out and your

296
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,830
bills $300 you needed one tablet you got
six and yeah be careful but buy cheap

297
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,040
stuff from china to practice on don't
buy the really expensive stuff because

298
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,480
you're going to destroy it

299
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,750
practicing your lab on cheap stuff

300
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:49,050
all right firmware analysis I there's a
couple ways we need to obtain this we

301
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:52,860
can pull it from the device itself pull
it from the the services that are

302
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,169
offering these updates for download

303
00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:01,140
maybe we even need to observe an update
for the device and sniff the traffic on

304
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,450
a span port and recover this data from
from network captures and start doing

305
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,610
some extraction mounting of the firmware
and then do some analysis of these as

306
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:17,429
well we're talking software in this case
specifically if we're able to obtain the

307
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:22,170
firmware from some sort of software
download eunuch strings is your friend

308
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,880
Ben walk as well start mounting these
and looking at the operating system

309
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,720
themselves

310
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,580
hey onboard analysis I jtag is also a
great way for recovering some of the

311
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,560
firmware and memory from these devices

312
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,240
potentially we're looking in this
content for passwords that are using

313
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,020
other services static password stored in
memory for various services

314
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:48,240
device configuration how are the chips
configured how our services on this

315
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,770
device that are running configured that
our best to have physical access to some

316
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,549
of the stuff because then we can start
examining it do filesystem forensics

317
00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:04,200
memory forensics find out what's there
and interact with buses such as spi and

318
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,990
I to see and even cereal for observing
internship communications on bootup time

319
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:15,720
is in many cases we see the processor
sending commands to the radio every time

320
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,950
of boot up and now you know how the
radio is configured so you can use that

321
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:25,110
stuff in additional analysis portions
when you start doing a proprietary radio

322
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,639
analysis

323
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,380
ok some other radio fun stuff

324
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,039
I'm software-defined radio has exploded
in recent years

325
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,070
awesome stuff take some of our software
defined radio do the rtst art for

326
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:46,918
receive only on the cheap the hacker
half the blader F and the upcoming lime

327
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:53,190
st are relatively inexpensive with some
free open-source software consider the

328
00:26:53,190 --> 00:27:00,480
yardstick 1i the CC 1111 Don's dongle or
in fact the yardstick one which is very

329
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,149
similar the problem that we end up with
some of these proprietary protocols as

330
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:11,610
there often non-complex but take a lot
of work to recover unless it's something

331
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:17,010
you're doing every day it's potentially
time consuming and frustrating there's

332
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,179
tons of other standards for us to look
at and purpose-built devices

333
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:26,760
I that the Nordic shock / stuff which is
the the recent keyboard stuff that

334
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,320
bastille research has released to
recover keyboard and mouse strokes a

335
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:37,770
z-wave zigbee wireless heart depending
on your environment lower how many guys

336
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,720
have seen lower stuff already

337
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,539
I had never heard of laurent about a
month ago like this is new this should

338
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,550
be something that we start looking at
more

339
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:53,500
thinking critically about some of these
things that happen on these on these

340
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,890
networks what happens when we capture
traffic and what happens if we replay

341
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:01,840
that without modification can we modify
traffic what happens when we modify the

342
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,590
traffic change source destination
addresses think it's not just turned red

343
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,679
stuff off turn its neighbors stuff off

344
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:15,040
yeah okay some Wi-Fi stuff some
different ways that we can deal with

345
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,440
this not only should we attack the
devices with Wi-Fi to the device but

346
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,910
stand up our own network to connect them
to if we can do open wireless network we

347
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:29,800
can start inspecting traffic or we can
do that upstream ethernet it do you need

348
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,770
to do to make that happen so we can
expect Wi-Fi traffic coming from the

349
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:38,710
device examine the traffic during all of
our different times during boot during

350
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,270
normal use when it's not in use when you
so if you're interacting with the device

351
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,210
what happens when you're interacting the
device what happens when it's sitting

352
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,580
idle doesn't do periodic check-ins

353
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,139
what does the device do when you attack
it or modify hardware

354
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,140
yes you'll be doing hardware hacking
with the power turned on

355
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:05,020
yeah there's potentially lots of traffic
for us to announce analyze its going to

356
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:11,110
be challenging in many cases the Wi-Fi
stuff in itself is not going to be

357
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:17,709
terribly useful otherwise so the Wi-Fi
itself is 11 standard as opposed to

358
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,360
other network traffic 8028 or 3gp you
know that you named it the wireless

359
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,240
portion is going to be fairly limited
for its analysis because in many cases

360
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,960
these devices are put in a consumer's
home where the consumer defines the

361
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,180
network unless the network is defined by
the manufacturer and there will be those

362
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,010
cases that that will happen and then
analysis of Wi-Fi itself is important

363
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,880
bluetooth is hard

364
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,690
bluetooth low energy is frightening
because they simplified the stack

365
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:54,400
massively it's also loads of fun i
consider over 21 or standard Bluetooth

366
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,840
low-energy dongle of some variety most
of the new ones now are supporting a

367
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,730
Bluetooth low-energy I this one happens
to be the nanny state UT 100 in the

368
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:12,250
newest version it supports 24 bluetooth
low energy at max power awesome stuff

369
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,370
ok i use some of our various tools

370
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,379
I'm do some listening potentially do
some playback with something like Bailey

371
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,680
sweet and Bailey replay interact with
the public services that don't require

372
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,980
authentication read values right values
this gets fun real fast

373
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,560
hey discover them connect to him it's
possible when pairing is involved that

374
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,139
we can do in recovery with crackle do
all sorts of fun stuff with bluetooth

375
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,830
low energy if you had to pick a wireless
technology that was a easy to interact

376
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,879
with and have some fun with and controls
all sorts of stuff this is where I go

377
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,300
first it build yourself a web
application testing lab I'm sure mark

378
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,070
many of you do this now consider some of
the open source projects such as asthma

379
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,750
mathilde mathilde day however you want
to pronounce it happily bank so forth

380
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:10,000
there are tons of web application test
frameworks that you can use to practice

381
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,750
your skills stand those up use a burp
said Charles proxy take your pick of

382
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:22,390
there's tons of tools out there for web
application scanning and testing some of

383
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,890
my favorites listed there

384
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:30,370
I derby CT scan and sequel map there's
there's a myriad of tools and in fact

385
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,370
you can write your own some other ways
to practice

386
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:40,399
go look at bug bounty programs they give
you permission to hack their stuff with

387
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,480
certain scopes live targets this is
what's gonna be testing the real world

388
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,350
anyway isn't it yeah not just hack me
bank because that's easy pick something

389
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,659
harder okay

390
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,610
in practice web applications or disaster
we know this cause and scripting sequel

391
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,070
injection the list goes on

392
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:05,210
section 20 should token expiration
modification token and recalculations

393
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,400
sequential sessions what happens when we
modify all this stuff can we access

394
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,170
items within their web pages with
authenticated access that gives us the

395
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,910
ability to perform commands what happens
we try to escalate our privileges and

396
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:25,700
become the admin user field length
checking cross-site scripting e the list

397
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,450
goes on

398
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:33,590
fun stuff how about some mobile app lab
stuff it's time to buy a device

399
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:39,500
how many of you guys have tried to do
mobile app testing on iOS in a virtual

400
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:45,650
yet renders like def neck with that you
gotta go buy a real device and jailbreak

401
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:51,830
it i like using real Android hardware
for doing this as well because there's

402
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:56,360
nothing better than real hardware
dealextreme for the win right 10 android

403
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,110
tablets and sure you're going to android
tablets from dealextreme and they've got

404
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:05,209
Kit Kat on it or an older version of
Android guess what

405
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:11,870
so did the users hey these manufacturers
the mobile apps for these IOT devices

406
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,080
have to be backwards compatible for some
of these operating systems

407
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,670
who cares if it's the late not the
latest and greatest because this is

408
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,430
there going to be the user support base

409
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:29,150
ok start picking some app have some fun
take a choice but if you find stuff

410
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:35,700
report date disclose it responsibly I
mean you don't have to i important to

411
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,420
you please do you know what let's be
let's be good human beings it's about

412
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:47,310
making this better in practice and take
a look at our traffic hammer nails

413
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,250
through this is a samsung devices
probably not a good idea

414
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:59,700
okay what happens when we respond faster
to request with malformed packets

415
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,700
how does a lot of the apps react

416
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,360
we are now able to observe a traffic we
can now potentially interact with the

417
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,900
web apps directly outside of the
application we may be able to capture

418
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:18,240
credentials which would be used to later
when doing API interaction start looking

419
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,139
at what the app looks like on disk what
is it storing on disk for credentials or

420
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:33,839
other interesting information hidden
boolean values that change the operation

421
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:41,460
of the app itself is developer is not
developer yes we've seen that ok what's

422
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,740
in the configs what's on disk what's in
memory and all sorts of fun stuff

423
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:57,629
network penetration testing lab yes this
pen works I think okay we can spend days

424
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,960
talking about network penetration
testing no we're not going to i'm

425
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,800
standing between you guys and lunch
right or ham radio testing at one

426
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,630
o'clock downstairs

427
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,500
we've got all sorts of different
networks to test all of them in various

428
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,910
scenarios but in many cases very similar
you know where we're turning the

429
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,210
perspective 90 degrees is too where we
have access and what we need to interact

430
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,170
with

431
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:23,950
we've got different scenarios as an
insider threat is something that we're

432
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,790
going to assume compromise on an
internal network assumed compromise on

433
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:32,349
an IOT device you're putting these in
the hands of millions of hackers right

434
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:40,780
as users assume a compromise IOT device
what happens there build a lab ESX for

435
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,589
the win

436
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:50,380
msdn licenses for the win the lab
virtualize it where you can if you need

437
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,460
real hard way

438
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,359
hardware consider something small low
power draw a raspberry pi or droid Bo

439
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,700
bones those types of things i love
raspberry PI's as improved in his talk

440
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:06,220
at eight hit a nice lost count at 15 and
i showed you a picture

441
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,359
afterwards and there were there were 12
sitting in the box on my desk and those

442
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:15,160
are the ones that are not in product
production production right it's really

443
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,618
weird to say about your home network
production network at home this is an

444
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,990
IOT network gets in production

445
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,439
yeah because what happens when you take
it down your IOT stuff stops working

446
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,819
ok i consider taking a look at some of
the ways they do

447
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:35,410
ccie lab building and testing build one
of those labs to so you can play with

448
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:43,029
network protocols and network devices
external testing can be all sorts of fun

449
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:47,079
and consider seeing what's available for
some of these services with open source

450
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,369
intelligence do some scanning and
enumeration with permission of course

451
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:58,030
ok then we start moving that into an
internal one of our external is

452
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:05,230
successful and we're in thank him in the
next we turn in external pentest to an

453
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:10,450
internal one and then we go down that
rabbit hole and then we also need to

454
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,270
consider what we're going to use for
exploitation and command-and-control

455
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:19,720
consider using test environments in
something like AWS to do external

456
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,839
testing stand up your own services
actually across the internet and notify

457
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:25,200
AWS that you're going to be testing them

458
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,859
because they like that in practice

459
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:36,060
yeah this is our days and days and days
of network pentesting so what recon

460
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:42,029
first figure out what's available and do
some scanning do some enumeration and

461
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:46,589
analysis of what you find do some
exploitation once you're on the system

462
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:50,040
village the village for what's available
pivot to other networks lather rinse

463
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,180
repeat

464
00:37:51,180 --> 00:38:05,669
thanks can analyze multiple times as we
go through api testing is hard

465
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:12,570
why we won't know what the API
implementation will look like we will

466
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,849
only be able to build simulations in the
lab we have no idea how each one of

467
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:23,609
these manufacturers is building their
own API we can get some ideas about the

468
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:27,779
technologies they may use but the actual
implementation will be different so pick

469
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,780
something and play with it to build
practice

470
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,190
I'm Casey I'm gonna put the microphone
down so you can actually get a picture

471
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:49,290
without something from my face like this
ready yes im a whore

472
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:54,000
alright see I know these things

473
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,089
I'm not bashful about it alright alright
we're gonna need to find some

474
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:03,720
programming languages potentially to to
do some interaction with these EP is

475
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,680
pick one

476
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,339
I don't care which one my intern
programs in high school

477
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:15,630
go for it I looked at him but he said
Haskell like you rascal

478
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:21,810
and then he wrote kick-ass stuff Haskell
right go for it

479
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:27,020
alright consider use of web proxies as
well interact with the API through a

480
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,560
browser manually or scripted and then
intercept all that as well it's very

481
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,560
similar in many cases to web app testing

482
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:42,350
okay what are we dealing with four
languages for api testing go straight

483
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:50,690
xml soap json restful api is whistles
yeah they're still there

484
00:39:51,230 --> 00:40:00,650
binary HTTP their own custom
implementation yuck

485
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,960
now go implement this in your lab and
try to play with all these every one of

486
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,320
these from an IOT devices going to
introduce their own individual

487
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,860
challenges we're not going to be able to
test everyone in the lab but we're going

488
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,030
to get clothes and get practice for
where we may see issues with other

489
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:22,370
implementations going to go and deploy
something in your testing environment

490
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:25,880
that uses one of these api methodologies
from say an open source project and test

491
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,450
it

492
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,770
build your skills with some of these
tools and then find libraries to

493
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,790
interact with these api services in the
your language of choice and start

494
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:39,259
scripting the heck out of it and I never
wanted to be a programmer i didn't want

495
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,970
to sit in front of a box and code all
day so I specifically chose not to do

496
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:50,149
programming that was a mistake is what
am i doing now i'm learning programming

497
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:57,560
languages go to no starch press is booth
and pick up no starch for kids are about

498
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,220
program for a Python for kids that is
the book that i'm teaching myself python

499
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:06,259
with seriously why because when my
eight-year-old wants to start

500
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,380
programming in Python in her minecraft
server that I have set up for her

501
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,820
have I got a book for you

502
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,950
and daddy's already read it okay yeah I
love that book

503
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:21,569
i'm using a kids book written for an
eight-year-old to learn python it's

504
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,790
perfect mindset for me

505
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:27,960
my wife says I'm a ten-year-old trapped
in a four-year-old body she's right

506
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:36,480
fart jokes are funny ok alright I'm a
little early nine minutes or so 10

507
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,580
minutes or so but I really want you guys
to think about this is this is a massive

508
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:52,920
undertaking isn't it like whoa yeah like
think about all these things in this be

509
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,520
an ecosystem that we've just talked
about and if you're going to test this

510
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,980
entire ecosystem the volume of lab that
we need to build and the practice I get

511
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,890
why this is hard

512
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,460
this is encompassing lots of skills are
needed

513
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:16,049
ok we're going to need to develop our
skills unfortunately it's not as easy as

514
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:24,450
asking tank for instructions on how to
fly military and 109 helicopter if we

515
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,509
built a OT devices better maybe we can
make this happen

516
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:33,870
I wouldn't want to do it in the state of
security IOT right now because render

517
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,330
will screw with my brain

518
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:40,230
okay yeah if you do that all right
you're right you're right

519
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:51,779
alright so full scope note ii ecosystem
penetration testing and compasses many

520
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:58,020
disciplines and requires volumes of
knowledge this is not something that

521
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,020
we're going to fix overnight sucks

522
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,200
he also finished early

523
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,660
I've heard that about him

524
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:20,480
well there goes my raise for the year
okay all right so you guys remember the

525
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,390
scene in the matrix when they go to
rescue Morpheus and go through the metal

526
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:32,029
detector and metal detector beeps and
neyo opens his jacket and he's loaded

527
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:42,049
down weapons and the guard goes holy
shit yes you need to do that don't go on

528
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:47,210
your adventure alone don't go rescue
Morpheus alone field a team to do this

529
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:52,280
why because if I think about this from
what we do i'm not an expert in every

530
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,680
one of those five scenarios but I have
people that are and i work with

531
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,149
fantastic folks and I have a community
that are awesome at these things too

532
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:06,859
I can't do it all I just can't I'd like
to think I'm that smart

533
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:16,220
no we need a team these 2 kicked ass and
they got Morpheus back and allegedly

534
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,250
they made things better okay

535
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:27,078
together we can help build a better
ecosystem and if we're not building it

536
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:31,910
we can affect how other people build
their networks by testing it

537
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:36,109
appropriately and helping them fix the
issues so that render can't control my

538
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:40,730
brain or my panda or my sex toys

539
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,529
ok or abused the data that is collected
by all of those together

540
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:50,808
wait a minute if you're collecting data
about my panda and my sex toys at the

541
00:44:50,809 --> 00:44:52,490
same time we've got a problem

542
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:57,799
ok let's build it better let's help
other folks build it better so let's

543
00:44:57,799 --> 00:45:00,799
start considering some methodology for
making this happen

544
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:07,549
so where do we get this methodology
turns out I bit off more than I could

545
00:45:07,549 --> 00:45:12,950
chew when I thought would be a 30 page
document is running somewhere around a

546
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,930
hundred and thirty pages

547
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:19,399
yeah there's not enough hours in the day
for me to complete its almost there

548
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:26,720
I didn't make it for derby condom sorry
so sad i know i saw but we're almost

549
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,169
there

550
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,290
we know what the components are going to
look like we know we have the bulleted

551
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:33,319
list of all the things that we want to
talk about is now taking that bulleted

552
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:37,700
list and making a cohesive so someone
can use it and not just be a bulleted

553
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,430
list and and make it robust we're going
to have that available there is a page

554
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:48,710
here describing what I OT is I hadn't
gardens.com /i ohta it's going to be

555
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:49,970
soon

556
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:56,419
I don't know the date I'm managing
workloads and Family and Children and

557
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:01,220
just started actually making sure i'm
taking care of my health by like going

558
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,220
to karate six times a week or some
ridiculous stuff like that

559
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,980
yeah i got my ass handed to me by an
eight-year-old girl jamming my daughter

560
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,980
hyphenation that's gonna change

561
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,829
okay so yeah let's that please be
patient it will be here we talked about

562
00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:21,859
some stuff you guys can start drawing
the dots but we want to make it

563
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:26,210
available and usable for someone that
may not have all the pieces that that we

564
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:31,309
do and give us the ability to help
select teams and build those teams will

565
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:32,450
be here I promise

566
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,529
so have you guys ever heard of the
theory about when you make a commitment

567
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,980
to someone by speaking it allowed that
now you kind of have to commit to that

568
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:48,799
okay i have just done that to all of you
that is my promise it will be soon

569
00:46:48,799 --> 00:46:52,160
what soon as i don't know but i've made
the commitment to make this available

570
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,098
and have it complete for all of you and
I'd love to have some feedback on the

571
00:46:58,099 --> 00:47:01,010
presentation know there's something I
forgot is there something I where you're

572
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:01,549
crazy

573
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:04,730
get rid of the API stuff if you want to
