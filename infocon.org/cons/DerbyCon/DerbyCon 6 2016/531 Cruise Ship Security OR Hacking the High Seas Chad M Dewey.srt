1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,350
ok ok alright thanks for coming

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,350
not exactly full room that's okay nice
and intimate

3
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,369
ok this presentation hacking the high
seas or cruising pat testing is

4
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,550
something I've been doing kind of for a
while

5
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,989
unofficially so i'm sharing some my
findings today

6
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,550
ok so a little bit about me I'm Chad 28
computer science and information systems

7
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,230
professor second valley state university
of michigan i have some degrees and

8
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,239
stuff i do pen testing from time to time
outside of teaching and I'm curious

9
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,480
about weird stuff like cruise ships cars
medical equipment stuff like that

10
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,559
ok just another guy sharing information

11
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,890
ok so you know this is not what I'm
trying to accomplish here i'm trying to

12
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,100
help prevent stuff like this from
happening

13
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,548
I would hope that you know nobody takes
any information that i share today and

14
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,210
does anything malicious we're all
ethical here right

15
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,240
ok alright so the the cover my ass part

16
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,439
ok no authorized access to the cruise
ships of the cruise ship systems was

17
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,240
attempted to obtain ok so in other words
I didn't touch anything okay nice and

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,839
legit in-person observations were mostly
done on the ship and every most

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,610
information was found be publicly
available in information sources some of

20
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,070
these sources i'll be showing here in a
little bit you're probably familiar with

21
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,939
all of them

22
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,898
ok ok so I've done a lot of cruising
over the years I've gone on three cruise

23
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,600
lines with several different cruise
ships on each line my plan on going on

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,240
more I don't plan on stopping anytime
soon

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,700
ok anyway so each cruise line has their
own pros and cons regarding various

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,819
forms of security

27
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,578
ok so before the cruise here's what
we're gonna be talking about before the

28
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:23,120
cruise looking yourself up when you sign
up for an account on some of these

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,069
cruise lines you know you put your
personal information and all that there

30
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:31,760
there's ways to get a few little goodies
there during the cruise when you're on

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,840
the cruise

32
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,810
there's some drawbacks to that because
you're limited on what you cannot

33
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,439
physically take on the ship especially
to take a plane

34
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:46,310
ok you know the TSA loves us and you may
end up with no internet access so you

35
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,379
have no google okay you're in the middle
of the ocean so hopefully don't forget

36
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,250
anything

37
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,109
alright so before the cruise ok I
blacked out some of the things you might

38
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:00,290
be able to figure out who these are if
you've gone on a cruise before how many

39
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,918
people were gone on a cruise before so
that's why you're here you love prison

40
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,439
okay you're curious good

41
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:13,250
ok so in this particular instance if you
prove this line you you can update for

42
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,900
example your cruise history

43
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,629
okay in case you know you missed
anything as we all do from time to time

44
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:26,929
you can add past cruises that we may or
may not have really gone on in this case

45
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,409
there are no humans verifying your
information is correct or truthful

46
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:37,280
ok crew status just to explain this one
a little bit most cruise lines as the

47
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,430
people who have gone on a cruise before
know that there's different tiers the

48
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,150
more times you cruise the higher the
tier you are and sometimes get more

49
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,259
benefits and rewards from that ok just
like going to the grocery store you know

50
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:52,790
it's a freaking cruising kind of thing
so Allah the more you cruise more

51
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,548
benefits a loyalty program essentially
ok some of these freebies could be free

52
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:03,169
drinks so many minutes of free Wi-Fi
drinks with the captain and on some

53
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:06,409
cruise lines though I haven't been on
one of these yet you get to the bridge

54
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:09,409
in the engine room I'd like to do that
one of these days

55
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:15,589
alright so if you take a look at this

56
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:22,219
ok I was basically able to add however
many cruises i wanted i found that

57
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:24,110
there's one little trick

58
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,099
to this ok you have to have going on a
cruise at least once with them but after

59
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:31,878
that you can like you know completely
remember other crews you've gone before

60
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,710
I apologize cuz I gotta come up here you
won't get here in the microphone anyway

61
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,560
so uh visual seven cruises okay i have
not been on seven cruise with this

62
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:50,930
cruise line okay i've only been on for
hey you'll notice the that I went on the

63
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:59,840
Emerald print oopsie I went on this
emerald ship recently and then of course

64
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,989
went on his crown ship and if you look
down here

65
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,529
hey I really want on this one but then I
decided to push a little bit and say

66
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:12,139
okay well maybe i can add another so i
did when i was a little bit further

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,889
I never cruised on this cruise line in
2009 even get to go on a cruise in

68
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:21,710
$MONTH 2009 for me okay down here you'll
see this is one of my first cruises down

69
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,469
here in 2005 with that particular ship
then if you look below that you'll see

70
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:30,710
that there's this crown shit that
supposedly went on

71
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:37,339
ok that it took credit for in 2005
there's only one problem with that that

72
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:41,810
particular ship didn't take its maiden
voyage until june two thousand six ok so

73
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,669
there's no information sanitization
going on at all they're ok I have

74
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:50,659
notified this cruise line about this i
notified in quite a while ago they seem

75
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,949
to be okay with it

76
00:05:51,949 --> 00:06:00,500
so am i had ok alright so what do you
get for for this frequent cruising

77
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,770
benefit in this case

78
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,460
well this is a little bit different look
at the SEC sometime again sometimes get

79
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,460
Wi-Fi drinks with the captain free drink
so on and so forth

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,039
also when you sign up for these cruises
they allow you to celebrate

81
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,919
ok whether it be a birthday or a
anniversary or graduation so on and so

82
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,919
forth on this case it was

83
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,770
hold it check we are you sure yep

84
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,919
yeah come on it

85
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:47,270
ok and play all right okay sorry you
missed the the forefront of it but the

86
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,628
most interesting stuff is towards the
end anyway so we're good

87
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:55,550
alright so I in this case again its my
anniversary again

88
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,080
ok again to get these freebies for
specific types of things like

89
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,770
anniversaries and birthdays and so on so
forth

90
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,900
anniversaries tend to be the most
lucrative ok this is what i got for it

91
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:15,590
being my anniversary again $25 wine gift
card a spa gift card and a cruise photo

92
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,400
and a bottle of wine

93
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,109
ok so during the cruise remember you're
on the cruise ship

94
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,430
ok so they have Wi-Fi and all these
ships somewhere more secure than others

95
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:38,270
for example when I went in 2005 the
standard that just came out was wpa and

96
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,849
now know they were using wpa and WEP at
the time sorry

97
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:49,009
so they have multiple networks spending
on the ship 14 crew 14 guests

98
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:52,310
there's out several other issues Wi-Fi
on these ships are extremely expensive

99
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:58,879
the last cruise I went on for full
internet access it was $25 a day that's

100
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,710
a little pricey

101
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:11,150
okay okay yeah to me on the last ship
coconut looking around

102
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,919
ok so a comparison of the Wi-Fi networks
on each of these ships ok running

103
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,169
regarding Wi-Fi the last cruise I went
on appeared might be the most secure

104
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,318
given a limited time frame you're on
vacation right we're not going to sit

105
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,550
here and screw around Burke we're going
to actually enjoy the Sun the purpose of

106
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,500
this is to take a vacation

107
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,409
ok on previous cruise with other cruise
lines Wi-Fi can actually be obtained

108
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,299
free

109
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,169
depending on your crew status for
example platinum on one of these cruise

110
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:48,769
lines gets you honored 53 minutes a
Wi-Fi you know what's that worth well

111
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,470
you know i'm slow internet access

112
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,459
I mean it's satellite internet so but
it's free Wi-Fi

113
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:59,750
anyway is over time as expected to
create encryption has gotten better with

114
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,750
the Wi-Fi as you would expect but anyway

115
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:08,390
ok so physical security walking around
the ship their safes in each of these

116
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:15,199
rooms summer numeric keypad summer
magnetic stripe i found one on this last

117
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,529
cruise was magnetic stripe and they
suggested using your credit card or

118
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:24,470
driver's license negative magnetic strip
to lock and unlock it as it as a unique

119
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,360
key

120
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,670
yeah i'm not going to do that they yeah
they write yeah it doesn't mess with my

121
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,990
card so I i actually found out that it
doesn't matter what you use

122
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,959
I magnetic anything with a magnetic
strip I used uh a longhorn gift card i

123
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:47,869
used my school ID you know that sort of
stuff and it didn't matter so why they

124
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,950
want you to use that I have no idea
anyway staff doors were almost never

125
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,899
locks them had no locks whatsoever doors
to the ship internals were almost never

126
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:01,850
locked so in other words getting into
places where that wasn't intended for

127
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:08,570
passengers many had no again many had
the locks staff laundry my found some

128
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,070
down towards the bottom of the ship
that's where the cruise listes but the

129
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,240
floor above there was a laundry cart
that laundry name tags and you can

130
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,360
probably guess we could do with laundry
nametags ok it's a social engineering

131
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,940
thing you could do what I belong here i
got my name tay ok let's see found

132
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,050
solace six-passenger badges lying around
your badge is associated with a credit

133
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,709
card

134
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:34,399
ok so if you leave would you leave your
credit card around probably not but they

135
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,360
just look at his badges they look as as
an actual credit card

136
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,529
ok so you know that's not the ship's
fault okay they actually do have some

137
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,439
things some fraud prevention techniques
in place

138
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,709
unfortunately the employees normally
don't use them for example they swipe

139
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,258
the card a picture of

140
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:54,249
of the passenger shows up you know so
they can actually verify this is who

141
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:58,749
this person is and then they can buy
their drinks okay but again the problem

142
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:02,199
is they swipe the card and the punching
numbers they didn't mean to get a chance

143
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:05,349
to see the picture there just to visit
you know trying to hurry up and get the

144
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,279
drinks L so it's not well implemented
picture right now

145
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,350
cruise passenger room privacy issue only
one cruise ship that they're only one

146
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:22,600
cruise that I get been on actually kinda
took some steps to help pastor privacy

147
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,119
outside of the passenger doors are
outside of your cabin doors on most

148
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:33,189
cruise ships have your full name anybody
else staying in that room along with

149
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:34,959
your crew status

150
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,108
okay like if your platinum gold and
stuff like that

151
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:43,809
okay it's a little bit of a privacy
issue you know you can always pull it

152
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:48,429
off I guess but uh anyway

153
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:55,539
alright so here's one of these secure
areas ok if you take a closer look you

154
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,609
know crew only do not enter

155
00:11:57,609 --> 00:12:03,850
that's highly secure you know you can't
just walk through that right so on you

156
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:10,269
know that kind of becomes an issue on
most cruise ships there really isn't a

157
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:14,799
whole lot separating the passengers from
the crew now with exception of the ships

158
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:23,980
control room and engine room and all
right okay so what do these ships look

159
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,069
like here's a picture of the engine
control room again I've never been

160
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:31,660
inside of an engine control room i found
this picture on the Internet

161
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,689
ok that's it hello

162
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:38,379
no I see I honestly have and i can
honestly say i haven't been inside one

163
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:42,579
of these individual rooms yet hopefully
I can get invited into want to see what

164
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:46,628
they're like it as you can see here
they're heavily computerized ok you can

165
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:49,569
see all those monitors on the walls and
so it's pretty crazy so this is the

166
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,019
engine room okay

167
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,750
this is the bridge ok again I've never
been in the bridge before depending on

168
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,140
which cruise line you go with they still
do give tours of the bridge depending on

169
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,490
your cruise status

170
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:09,750
ok very very computerized ok if you look
here this is a navigation unit

171
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,470
ok take a closer look you can see that
it's a Sperry marine vision master ft

172
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,100
doing a little bit of searching on this
you can find quite a bit of information

173
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,000
ok including I can like an owner's
manual

174
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:30,300
okay i know nothing about a Sperry
marine vision master ft but I can read a

175
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,010
manual and what I found in the manual
was and by the way this very Marine

176
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,450
Division master this very marine
navigation systems are very widely is

177
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:47,280
not only in cruise ships but also no
luxury yachts government vessels you

178
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,490
navy stuff like that and so if there was
widely used one of the problems with

179
00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:00,360
that here's a page out of the manual and
there's one of the issues there's still

180
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,360
all running windows XP ok which loss
important 2014 so if there's any

181
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,830
vulnerabilities now and they are
network-connected ok i actually asked no

182
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:17,580
i don't know i asked and somebody told
me that they were hit

183
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,430
yeah that they are network-connected
alright so after the cruise I decided to

184
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,770
do a little bit of looking around

185
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:33,930
okay once again cya anyway so they all
use public IP addresses you know they

186
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,760
have to communicate with short somehow
they have internet access so uh you know

187
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,770
they're they're searchable ok they all
belong to or most of the missions they

188
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,620
belong to the maritime
telecommunications network

189
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,620
k which has a very narrow range of IP
addresses

190
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,510
ok we'll get to that in a second and I
found quite a few issues

191
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:02,310
ok so I'm looking from the outside this
is what the maritime telecommunications

192
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,689
network looks like i'm sorry that's kind
of hard to read but the the cedar

193
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:07,350
dresses

194
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:14,580
208 . 114 . 96 that 0 / 19 that's the
maritime telecommunications network what

195
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,640
most ships are connected to if they have
connectivity at sea

196
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,510
ok little bit about the maritime
telecommunications network it's a

197
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,140
satellite communications network you
know obviously he can't run cat5 across

198
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,780
the ocean anyway uh several cruise lines
use some electric gas oil rigs

199
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:42,209
government military vessels antibiotic
commercial vessels like freighters so

200
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:48,240
when you do some searches within this
maritime telecommunications network they

201
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,110
were nice and up to display exactly what
ships they all belong to

202
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,230
ok so each specific ship has its own and
this is just a small list by the way you

203
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,120
start looking and you can

204
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:12,690
yeah yeah so there's quite a few alright
again publicly available information a

205
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,310
simple issues which IP address range are
given to each ships so meaning specific

206
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:23,310
cruise lines and specific ships ok i
also found a lot of other funny stuff

207
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:29,069
I thought this was gonna eat again
luxury yachts so my trust fund was the

208
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:36,180
joke that's it that's all you alright
this one it can't read it says a

209
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,780
maritime telecommunications government
services

210
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:47,370
I I don't really want to touch that one
and totally nuts when the needle ships

211
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,330
now anyway

212
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:53,490
ok so if you're curious of where some of
these ships are you can actually search

213
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,690
for that as well

214
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,310
ok there's a couple of websites one of
them is marine traffic.com you can hover

215
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:04,530
over each ship and see what the ship it
is freedom of the seas so on so forth

216
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:08,579
all these different colors mean
different things freighters personal

217
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,579
vessels cruise ships etc

218
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,950
here's a little bit of encryption
statistics based off of what i found

219
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:25,130
using showdown and might be some issues
here using older versions of ssl/tls so

220
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,130
on and so forth

221
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:35,000
alright so here's some public services
also running on some of the ships for

222
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,120
forward-facing people can connect to
them okay

223
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:47,570
pcanywhere anybody really anybody use
that no okay

224
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:58,580
windows remote management and tell not
import 2323 boy they're crafty alright

225
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,389
so anyway so these are some of the
services that are actually running

226
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,810
alright some notable issues some of
these operating systems and some of

227
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,500
these services running on these ships
are extremely outdated again these are

228
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,120
internet-facing services so there's a
debian match on a couple of ships

229
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,850
running an older version of openssh
voice-over-ip systems on a ship actually

230
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:28,699
have several ships run a with remote
access to the photo job to the voice

231
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,080
over IP system using default username
and password several ships running

232
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,149
services using the older linux kernel
microsoft exchange server 2003 which

233
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:46,550
hasn't been supporting a little while
some misconfigured firewalls again more

234
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:49,460
notable issues these are only the most
shocking i found there's there's a lot

235
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,350
more if you if you search for yourself
you'll see quite a few and much much

236
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,820
more i've done my due diligence try to
get ahold of these cruise ships

237
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,820
freighters and so on and so forth and
you explain what's going on and i'll try

238
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,720
to help

239
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,760
I've only sent what 14 14 different
companies and I received so far a total

240
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,660
of three responses so that's kind of
frustrating

241
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,140
anyway so all these vulnerabilities

242
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:23,030
I don't know maybe there enough to
create a

243
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:28,399
boat man that's that's it that's all I
me that's my attempt at being funny

244
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,100
ok so I again some cruise ships don't
bother to fix the lifesavers example the

245
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:40,250
cruise status issue one thing I forgot
to mention is that a again sometimes

246
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,670
they post that information outside of
your door your crew status your name

247
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:48,290
stuff like that on one particular cruise
line in order to claim your free Wi-Fi

248
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,680
minutes as a Platinum Member all you
need to know is your room number your

249
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:59,510
cabin number and your name so i just i
need some free Wi-Fi walk down the the

250
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,160
row of doors look for platinum or elite
status and there you go there's some

251
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,420
Wi-Fi

252
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:11,420
okay so some of the minor perks are okay
with that so my the cruise lines are all

253
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,490
improving the security for the
passengers gradually they really need to

254
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:23,150
work on those forward fate or internet
facing issues as expected some cruise

255
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,090
lines take security and privacy but more
serious than others again only one

256
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,480
cruise one cruise line that I've been
with does not post passenger information

257
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,280
outside of the door

258
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,960
ok good for them obviously freighters
our rigs and other entities like that

259
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,540
mean I have to worry about passenger
info but they still have their own

260
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:44,120
issues as well if you're I found out
okay so i originally submitted this talk

261
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,909
to another conference besides in Las
Vegas back in February seven i found

262
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:55,310
that March there were some issues with
Somali pirates who got ahold of what

263
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,540
they were able to compromise a content
management system that content

264
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:05,930
management system held the manifestos
for what's on those ships so they were

265
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,260
able to be more efficient pirates they
found out what was on the on the ship

266
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,310
the freighter and were able to get on
the ship and exactly where to find those

267
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:18,500
containers and get they needed to get
off so so this is kind of an issue

268
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,620
anyway so there's always room for
improvement

269
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,220
alright so these are some of the people
kind of helped me along with this

270
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,000
presentation in life and brand from
activity percent sharing resources

271
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,270
information and additional insight he
kind of pushed me to keep going with

272
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,168
this thing

273
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,769
and I'm glad he did because i found a
lot more information research is still

274
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:42,499
ongoing on finding more and more stuff

275
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:46,460
dr. lonnie jackets got jeans for the
guidance with education life chris

276
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:54,259
Roberts for his influence and enthusiasm
yale-new Chris Roberts's know the the

277
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:56,570
plane guy commercial airline guy

278
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:02,509
ok anyway so I got a chance to talk with
a couple times pretty cool guy anyway

279
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:06,619
and then Christina my mother for their
inspiration inspiration support alright

280
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:10,100
other any questions

281
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:19,399
it's kind of dark all right

282
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:30,678
yes the surveillance system video I
didn't try that far if it's probably not

283
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,220
like they probably can't monitor it from
somewhere else so it's probably

284
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,340
firewalled off internally I didn't see
anything

285
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:43,519
one thing I did notice though I forgot
to put the presentation on this last

286
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,850
cruise I went on and then two of these
cruise lines to these three cruise lines

287
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,799
that ethernet ports all over the walls
