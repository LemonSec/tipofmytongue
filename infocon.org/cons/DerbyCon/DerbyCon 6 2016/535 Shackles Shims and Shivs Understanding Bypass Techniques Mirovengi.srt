1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,870
you say go and i'll go may not like go
out go put the slides just pick get that

2
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:16,859
was the joke

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,480
yeah alright excellent appreciate
everyone coming this evening

4
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:26,580
I mean I realized that standing room
only and I I thank you for that I i mean

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,229
i'm honored i truly am I realize and
recognize that it's really just because

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,040
you're waiting on your table at the hard
rock or wherever on fourth street but

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,170
hey I appreciate you being here I really
do

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,460
hopefully this will be something that is
interesting to you informational uh-uh

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,950
and so this is my talk this is a shackle
shims and SHIVs trying to have a better

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,199
understanding of locks to bypass them so
I am Marilyn G i'm a member of the

11
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,789
Fraternal Order of Loch sport better
known as fool's we we put on the

12
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,570
organization and are we put on the
lockpick village here at Derby khan and

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,750
in half since the beginning we are
honored to do so we are thankful to do

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,600
so because we get the opportunity to
come every year and hang out with

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,320
everyone and also hang out with other
members of the community and it's always

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,939
and everyone is always a good time are
you know the only real relevant

17
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,789
credential that i think i have $MONEY to
my name is that I spend a lot of time

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,320
with local law enforcement as every good
luck sport enthusiast should to help

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,080
promote the sport but then also you can
help teach law enforcement and uh and

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,380
then they will turn around and use those
you know use those skills themselves

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,670
also the standard disclaimer supply I'm
not responsible for anything you do with

22
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,869
what I you know what this information
are nice too because an individual and

23
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,090
on behalf of of you know my employer or
any organization also pictures and

24
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,689
videos using the in the presentation are
used without permission

25
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,679
however i did you try and give
attribution where appropriate

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,590
so why this talk right physical security
is important we often recognize that

27
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,270
it's important we often talk about why
we need physical security but but there

28
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,500
always seems to be this this kind of
binary thinking that we only look at

29
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,930
either picking the log or just kicking
down the door right i mean maybe it's

30
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,290
just be

31
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,670
because picking locks is the sexy thing
to do but we would much rather sit there

32
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,920
and spend 10 minutes like raking on a
lot because we couldn't single pic it

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,619
who when we probably could have bypassed
in the first five first five seconds and

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,849
we'll talk more specifically about what
bypassing means but a good example is

35
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,730
the gift that i have included including
the slide so to really to really talk

36
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,590
about bypass mechanisms we're not
talking about the Loch itself and we're

37
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,920
not really talking about the door itself
we're talking about the retention

38
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,418
mechanism that middle ground that's
that's really what is actually holding

39
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,109
the door in place was actually keeping
the door close the window closed the

40
00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:00,150
barrier whatever that may be in whatever
form it may be so some standard

41
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,560
retention mechanisms you have you have
latches you have deadbolts which are

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,579
familiar with we have wedges which we've
all used but are probably has a has a

43
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:15,389
more technical name I use wedge for a
for a specific reason which we'll get

44
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:19,470
into a bit uh they're all there are ball
bearings which you typically see in

45
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,440
padlocks you have caches another form of
latch typically like a on bars and

46
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,030
chains so for the most part everyone
saying in a hotel in the nearby facility

47
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,459
you probably have one of these in your
room then you also have more industrial

48
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,120
mechanisms like your crash bars like you
see on the doors

49
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,040
i'm here in the room are electric strike
mechanisms on the electromagnetic

50
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,099
mechanisms which depending on your
industry and depending on what you do

51
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,418
you probably your building probably
incorporate some form of an

52
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,250
electromagnetic uh retention mechanism
so since we're at a security conference

53
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,549
we have to use the standard triangle of
security functionality usability right

54
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:09,540
because as as we as you kind of see and
as you start looking at locks right this

55
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,358
this triangle plays out and plays into a
lot of organizations decisions on their

56
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:19,680
retention mechanisms right so what do we
mean by that so let's take for for

57
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,289
instance deadbolts right levels are high
security right because it's just

58
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:26,669
basically you know that

59
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,500
that cylinder that piece of metal that
traverses through you know from the door

60
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,760
into the door jamb and that's the
retention mechanism but there's nothing

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,159
fancy about it right so it's it has low
usability it has low functionality you

62
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,780
have you have to turn the key to open it
you have to turn the key to lock in

63
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,030
right and depending on the deadbolt it's
keyed on both sides right so not only so

64
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,109
you can't just the inside and lock it
you have to have a key and lock it so

65
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,970
we're talking loose low usability low
functionality and there's not really

66
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,940
really good consistent ways to bypass
these types of locks right there are

67
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,380
some mechanisms I tried desperately to
find pictures there there was the

68
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,770
chinese-made tool i think referred to as
a cat's-eye that basically you you pop

69
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,180
out a peephole and then you can pass
this tool through the peephole two then

70
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,880
actually reach down to have enough room
to grab the grab the back of the the

71
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,830
deadbolt right but again it it it was
kind of specific two doors that had

72
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,940
peoples and then you're also removing a
people which again depending on the

73
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,469
installation may be kind of a
destructive mechanism i could only find

74
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,070
references to it i remember talking
about it with with Ozma and some other

75
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,880
fools

76
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,150
unfortunately couldn't find any pictures
of it still so you have deadbolts people

77
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,859
use that bolts but we put in some cases
you do want more usability out of your

78
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,240
dead bolts right you don't want to have
to look you know unlock it and lock it

79
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,680
each time so it was very common in hotel
rooms for a while that she would have an

80
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,970
added deadbolts to your door that once
inside the room you can activate the

81
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,480
deadbolt and even if you keep on the
outside you couldn't open it you can

82
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,300
open the door right you had to from the
inside

83
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,860
open the door handle wool well a very
easy bypass tool then that came out of

84
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,110
that is is the under door tool and so
here's a here's a video we actually took

85
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,780
of Osman in the village yesterday
demonstrating the under door under door

86
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,780
tool

87
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,679
just quite simply a piece of a piece of
metal in a string that you pass under

88
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,030
the door you Kurt you know you rotate it
up so that you can grab the handle and

89
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,750
once you hook it on the handle between
holding the cord down and manipulating

90
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,190
the metal piece you can actually
manipulate the inside handle now in this

91
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,750
case obviously that wasn't a deadbolt
right and for the most part was actually

92
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:04,229
kind of surprised it seems like a UH the
hotel doors and this arm sorry though

93
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:07,949
the doors in this hotel don't seem to
have that deadbolt mechanism anymore

94
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:13,680
like they still have the sort of laches
but so maybe that functionality is going

95
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,660
away maybe that deadbolt mechanism is
going away but obviously the other door

96
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,520
to pool isn't limited to just dead bolts
on and will you know you kind of see

97
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,299
that the industry the under door tool
becomes really handy if you don't have

98
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,520
one I recommend either getting one or
making one because I mean what we'll

99
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,750
talk about more but they become really
handy tools to have around so it's

100
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,229
moving on from devil will will increase
the functionality and we get to the

101
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,210
wedge and why why I called a wedge right
as i have an engineering background the

102
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:51,388
wedge or specifically triangles are very
strong very unique shapes to use in

103
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:57,419
engineering and the same is true for you
know four doors so so when you have a

104
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,590
wedge right so in this case we have you
know just a triangle on the screen when

105
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:07,948
you apply a force down along the incline
that will move the wedge right so so

106
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,120
normally feel like a square and you have
to push the square horizontally to move

107
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,960
it horizontally well wedge you can push
it vertically and it'll move

108
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,210
horizontally and so that's why the wedge
became very popular to be used indoors

109
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:27,239
because now all the sudden you can have
you can have the wedge spring-loaded and

110
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,860
as the door closes and hits on the door
jam right the way the movement of the

111
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,900
door will drive the wedge back into the
door itself and then it'll actually

112
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,860
close once it gets once it gets close
then the spring pushes the way back out

113
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,450
and then and then your your your
attention mechanism then becomes the

114
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,400
broadside the flat side of the

115
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,540
edge and so it effectively becomes a
one-way gate right because you can go

116
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:58,260
through it but you can always come back
right so so the wage becomes a very very

117
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,460
useful you know useful mechanism because
we can increase functionality we don't

118
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,230
have to decrease the secure ability of
it that much but of course as anyone who

119
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:14,100
has been 15 to 18 and had some sort of a
credit card or something before you know

120
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,740
that wedges have flaws right so this is
a standard this is you just want to

121
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,090
probably countless youtube videos out
there of this this gentleman i think

122
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,580
either has a Dick's Sporting Goods car
or a bass pro shops card and he's he's

123
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,080
working it around the door jamb to get
to the wedge he drunk he drives the car

124
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,310
across the wedge which moves the wedge
back into the door such that then the

125
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,959
door opens right so pretty standard
technique if you just one more time just

126
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,690
to make sure because this becomes a very
important concept because it in the

127
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:55,170
simplest form this attack becomes useful
almost almost anywhere because pretty

128
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:02,099
much every door has a wedge in a little
in in a lot of places the wedge becomes

129
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,300
the only retention mechanism that they
rely on now there's some industrial

130
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,069
areas were obviously that's untrue but
it's still the wedge is a very very

131
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,980
useful to tool so places where this
doesn't exactly work out places like my

132
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:25,560
building where the door and the door
frame because of the you know contract

133
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,000
going to the lowest bidder

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,060
you don't exactly have the greatest
tolerances in the world

135
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,140
yes that's a tape measure yes that's
almost half an inch right we're like a

136
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,189
sixteenth of an inch or an eighth of an
inch short of being half an inch it's

137
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,050
almost big enough that can reach my
finger in and manipulate that wedge to

138
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,449
then actually drive it back and open
that door

139
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,710
fortunately this store is not my server
room unfortunately it's the mechanical

140
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,280
closet so it's where all the hvac
equipment is for the entire building

141
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,699
um so obviously that's not good are the
way

142
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:05,790
is not limited two doors on the you also
see the wedge and padlocks especially a

143
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,719
lot of your cheaper padlocks now this is
a clip from a Bosnian built video he's a

144
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,679
very renowned individual on youtube
because a lot of lock-picking stops a

145
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,540
lock picking locks sports stuff eh he
has some fantastic videos and this is

146
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,358
demonstrating shipping on a wedge
oriented a padlock specifically one of

147
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:28,499
the clear ones and uh and you know you
take the Sham you wrap around the

148
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:33,359
shackle and then you just slowly work
the shim down so that you drive the

149
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,799
wedge back and then now the shims are
the shackle is free to move now with

150
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,299
this padlock in particular and I cut the
clip short you you do have to shim the

151
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:47,309
other side of the shackle but once you
do so then the shackle opens right so if

152
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,040
you if you watch the whole video you see
you should both sides the shackle

153
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,209
because you can as you can see there on
the screen their shackles of problems

154
00:11:54,209 --> 00:12:00,059
are the the wedges on both sides drive
it in and then the and the shackle opens

155
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:09,329
so security tit-for-tat right red vs
blue are the all were a lot of help from

156
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:15,179
companies have gone is basically as you
as you pay more for a padlock and it

157
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:19,738
increases insecurities then they have a
ball bearings of the retention mechanism

158
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:24,959
and master lock even on certain locks
they have this this customer retention

159
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,628
mechanism and that's the the red part
they're such that it's it's auntie it's

160
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:37,230
shim proof or anti-ship because
basically just has the notch it has the

161
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,339
natural on the left-hand side above the
curve to try and really just catch the

162
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:47,189
ship as it gets in and so that you can't
you can't work around that but the ball

163
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:51,419
bearings are very effective as a
retention mechanism but again depending

164
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:54,329
on the tolerances depending on how it's
made

165
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:59,638
you may still be able to get ash Tim in
worship around the ball bearing right we

166
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:06,480
definitely had a um I've definitely seen
some some rather rather cheap ball

167
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,600
bearing locks that I mean you could
shake it hard enough

168
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,980
and you can open the shackles just
because the tolerances were just so so

169
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:21,630
terrible in that so moving on from
padlocks going back to the caches and go

170
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,569
ahead i'll go back to the caches like in
the hotel room are you have you have bar

171
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:32,699
mechanisms that will prevent the door
from opening fully right these are more

172
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:39,209
kind of a kind of a middle gap security
mechanisms but we have these uh but you

173
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:43,469
can go play again you can have these
tools that once you actually get the

174
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,959
door open and you hit on the catch

175
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,910
well if you can leave something in there
in the door as your closing the door

176
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,540
well that will push push the ball far
out of the way and then you can turn

177
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,910
around and open it again right so so
again we're looking at playing with the

178
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,839
tolerance is opening up spaces so that
we can get you know that you can get

179
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,790
tools in there and then manipulate the
retention mechanism chains have have

180
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:14,819
similar problems had the same problem in
this case of they've tied a rubber band

181
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:21,060
to the end of the chain and basically
he's going to get the chain attached it

182
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,239
to the door handle and as you close the
door

183
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,730
the chain slides away set and then it it
hits its release . and then the lock

184
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,589
opens right the chain opens is as you
see right there so understanding the

185
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:39,149
mechanism right understanding how it's
actually retaining it or or retaining

186
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:44,459
the door can then help you understand
how to bypass it right and that's that's

187
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,119
ultimately what we're driving out here
so now on to some more industrial

188
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,699
mechanisms like crash bars right again
we have crash bars in the room crash

189
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:58,560
bars come in all sorts of shapes and
sizes but typically rely on the wedge

190
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,810
the only issue is where the wedge is
located so it's so in this room the

191
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,079
crash bars the wedge is located with the
crash bar

192
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,880
this is a this is a picture from the
lockpick village where the the wedge is

193
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,189
actually at at top and so it's kind of
interesting with the wedge solely at the

194
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:21,689
top right there's nothing holding the
door at the bottom so you so you can

195
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:23,130
like pull the door out a little

196
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,030
bit and now you've got some room to play
with to where I don't know maybe you can

197
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:32,610
uh I'm gonna shove a tool or you know
some sort of like metal strip in working

198
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,450
all the way up to the top and then you
can try and manipulate the terminal

199
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,650
eight the wedge draw back into its
mechanism and then suddenly the door

200
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,319
opens right again

201
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,690
don't do that right don't do don't use
this information in a negative manner or

202
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,160
in any way that you choose show because
that's not on me and so those are crash

203
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,949
bars right even with with these right
here the wedge mechanism here you

204
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,330
definitely could probably get a little
remote you know get enough room that she

205
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:08,820
can get a tool in and then potentially
manipulate the wedge now electromagnetic

206
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,340
are definitely becoming more common uh
retention mechanisms solely because a

207
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:21,360
lot of places are relying on on on some
sort of digital access control so key

208
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,250
fobs rfid card swipes you know some sort
of mechanism like that and so if you're

209
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:31,020
going to go that route then you might as
well use electromagnetic solution to tie

210
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,260
into that you know so that you can open
it now it's not limited to

211
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,270
electromagnetics you could do door
strikes you could do solenoids most

212
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,410
commonly though it seems that that that
most contractors will install

213
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:50,219
electromagnetic systems and the way
these work right is is from the exterior

214
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,580
in you have some you know some access
control mac and you know mechanism so

215
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,940
you card swipe and then you're in but to
to maintain security you maintain secure

216
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:08,040
ability but have high usability they
don't want you have to card swipe out

217
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,859
necessarily depending on the
circumstance or they don't necessarily

218
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,280
want you to have two carts wipeout just
leave the building

219
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,930
so instead they'll add some other
mechanism like a push to exit or a

220
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,949
motion sensor that when it detects
motion here the door automatically

221
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:30,270
releases releases the law or even a
capacitive sensors i was in a was in a

222
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:35,430
building for a while where we're a push
the push bar was competitors capacitance

223
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,140
so when you touched it it complete

224
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,640
the circuit and then disengage the the
electromagnetic lock so that you can

225
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,630
open the door and then also there you
know our potential issues with power

226
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:52,050
outages and then the last thing the
magnetron with the ? I've never done

227
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:57,389
this I would love to but can't find
anybody to let me try had a buddy who

228
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,670
swore to me that you could take a
magnetron from a microwave and if you

229
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,230
hold it up on electromagnetic lock that
basically it produces a greater

230
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,630
electromagnetic field that it will
offset offset the en la can allow you to

231
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,210
open the door

232
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,040
true or not not really sure i haven't
tested it i would love to if you know a

233
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,290
place or you don't know about that
microwave I'm in I'm down I'm there but

234
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:31,020
uh but that's just one possibility right
and but with with a lot of these

235
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,360
mechanisms right exit bus exit buttons
motion sensors capacitance you know we

236
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,110
come back around to that under door tool
we're basically if that mechanism is

237
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,360
there you know it's there you can see
it's there

238
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,429
well can you reach it right under door
tool you could potentially reach in and

239
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:52,890
you know and and hit a button from the
side motion detectors you can you get to

240
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,950
it just had to be an under door 2 i'm
just using that as an example you get

241
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,840
the tool in you waving around such that
you trip the motion sensor door opens or

242
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,800
with an indication the capacitance touch
will and the issue that we had with it

243
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,870
was that you could walk in with a coat
hanger and just basically reach-in under

244
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:15,179
touch the coat hanger to the capacitance
bar and because the metal was conducted

245
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:20,520
it can obviously made the connection in
the door opens of course there's another

246
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,720
there's another fun thing you can do
with motion sensors this was a clip are

247
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,400
filmed in this hotel

248
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:35,250
I think two years ago by the illustrious
uh-uh progenitor yeah Dave are um

249
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,580
basically what he's showing here is the
doors locked in

250
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,470
he's putting there's a motion sensor at
on the top and then basically did we get

251
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,940
it you vape

252
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,210
so he proceeds to rip off that made and
he's blowing it through the crack at the

253
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,800
top of the door so it does the first one
it's a cloud in the air does the second

254
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,590
one and then the cloud the smoke the
babe you know is enough that it trips

255
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:09,870
the motion sensor and then he's able to
open up and so so Cody video recently

256
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:18,689
yeah yeah yeah because right because
typically typically those those sensors

257
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:23,820
work off of particulates in the air and
basically how you can occlude the

258
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,260
ultrasound you know the ultrasound
frequency that is it that it's a meeting

259
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:34,110
so uh I'm so yes just understanding how
the mechanism works can then give you

260
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,229
ideas on how to on how to bypass it

261
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:43,710
um and that's and that in a nutshell is
what this talk was about right

262
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:50,160
your mileage may vary how you use this
how you see this uh I will vary for you

263
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,990
will vary based on your environment your
scenario what you have going on of but

264
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,780
the what I'm trying to emphasize here is
understand how your barrier your

265
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,490
retention mechanism whatever that is

266
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,970
understand how that works because you
may think of them

267
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,170
you may think of a way to open that
that's faster than just sitting there

268
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,170
trying to pick it at or that's maybe not

269
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,669
that's not as destructive as just
breaking it whatever that may be

270
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,520
is bypassing a better option for you and
of course this this gift again from

271
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,440
reddit really nice-looking law really
fantastic looking game right obviously

272
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,240
it's a security gate and then he can you
can just reach in and manipulate the

273
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,090
lock from the soft side in the door
opens so with that in mind comments

274
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,850
questions concerns angry outbursts

275
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,000
yes that is a shift at the bottom of
angry outbursts

276
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,640
everything that you seem like a really
powerful negative on the outside and I

277
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,680
guess what he's got it right away

278
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:08,160
ok very cool i'm not seen yeah I'm sure
that total I totally believe that though

279
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,490
especially like with like some of the
rare earth magnets because yeah I mean

280
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,950
p.m. fields work basically on whichever
