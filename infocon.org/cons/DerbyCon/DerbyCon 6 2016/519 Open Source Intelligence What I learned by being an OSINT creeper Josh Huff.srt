1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
alright hey good morning everybody my
name is Josh off my talk today is on

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:18,150
person or open source intelligence it's
not gonna be a real technical talk one

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,840
of the creepiest things about Joseph is
that just about anybody cannot can do it

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:41,160
is what i learned by being innocent
creeping so we start with the defining

5
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,050
Oh sent this is a variation of the
military definition when it's done in

6
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,890
two parts

7
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,039
what it is and why we do it on ocean is
publicly available information plain and

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,610
simple

9
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,780
could be stuff to get the library online
on something somebody posts on a sign

10
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,399
outside of a storefront on but no sin is
defined by the intelligence discipline

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,820
on the intelligence produced from
publicly available information that is

12
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,809
collected exploited and reported to
address a specific intelligence

13
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:17,159
requirement that's a pretty tactical
definition and i like it because of love

14
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,680
you I am a digital forensics analyst for
still investigations were FBI firm out

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,380
of columbia south carolina on

16
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,189
I like that definition because most of
the time in the lab I've got a full

17
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,919
computer image or cell phone image and
there is a ton of information there if I

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,009
don't have a specific target to follow
and investigate and report on you're

19
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,060
just creeping around and people stuff so
you know the technical definition works

20
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,689
for me

21
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,990
thousands broken down a couple different
areas that make it interesting to a lot

22
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,170
of different people government and
military they're going to be paying

23
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,439
attention to information out there for
foreign intelligence you know stuff on

24
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,539
terrorism politics in law we're going to
see court documents arrest records now

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,750
inmate in prison records that kind of
stuff business you're going to be seeing

26
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,068
copyright information financial
reporting

27
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:14,869
competition and marketing type stuff on
the security community we all know red

28
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,400
teaming gonna be looking at network
structures account numeration IP

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,200
addresses SS IDs and then there's the
personal stuff addresses date of birth

30
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:31,939
what you do for a living who your family
is you know that's the creepy stuff for

31
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:36,769
you had a into the exercises a quick
talk about ethics and gentlemen out of

32
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,450
UK has a security blog up and I borrowed
this from it with his permission on you

33
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,560
just had a nice little segment of it
that I think defines a the good way to

34
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,419
do this stuff ocean is about examining
information and data that's public and

35
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:53,930
it should not involve invasions of
privacy legitimate researcher must know

36
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,370
where the line is drawn between ocean
and espionage the ladder including stuff

37
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,909
like eliciting information actually
illegal network penetration

38
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:05,750
eavesdropping other words things that
haven't proactively been made public

39
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:13,489
working for a private investigator we
walk in ethical line because we're

40
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,209
regulated by South Carolina law
enforcement division on so ethics is

41
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:23,060
easy for me to follow but then there's
the regular disclaimer don't be creepy

42
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,810
again those sent definition is out there
for a reason on being unethical is bad

43
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:37,280
but being a Snoopy jerk is something
completely different so don't do it a

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,989
little exercise like to do at these
talks on help develop kind of the same

45
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,680
mindset when you're looking at stuff i
took this image off of a Facebook page

46
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,169
last year it's got a on had a tag
something like a look at this deal at

47
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:57,530
kroger on something like that so I throw
it up there and I like to look at a

48
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,060
couple things that's what the account
owner wants us to see got an awesome

49
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,750
deal

50
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,609
seventy-eight cents a gallon put it up
online for all my friends it to brag to

51
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:13,699
first thing I want you to see they just
put 25 and a half gallons of gas into

52
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:19,010
something we can inference that they're
in a SUV truck minivan something like

53
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,608
that

54
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:23,419
second thing we look at is the
reflection in the background

55
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:30,470
bring up a little bit closer can't quite
make out the person but down in the

56
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,840
bottom right corner you can see a
taillight shape on can't exactly get it

57
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,109
but the back of it does look like a
larger vehicle so we get a validation

58
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,420
that it's probably a truck SUV something
so we can start working with that quick

59
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,260
google search for an SUV telling i was
looking for kind of a distinctive

60
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,190
Halfmoon shape that you can see down in
the reflection there's a few of them on

61
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,420
here that are kind of close but no cigar
will refine it just a little bit

62
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,760
they're going to used SUV taillight
think it's the fifth one on the top

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,900
there was a dead hit when we looked at
in the in the picture a little closer

64
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:15,140
click on that guy we got an ebay listing
for a dodge durango 2004 2009 so from

65
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,900
there we can jump to a couple different
directions

66
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,799
cars.com craigslist you know public
records arrest records new stories maybe

67
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,330
on try to drill and maybe who's driving
vehicles like this on from there you go

68
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:32,000
to people searches and you know that's
that's unintentionally produced dosent

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,930
but a good exercise to kind of get your
mind thinking and certainly this is an

70
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,520
intelligence we produced Oh sent people
thrown you know credit card numbers out

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:51,919
there is silly but we see it quite often
that was a Twitter post thinking with

72
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,280
the no-scent mindset there we can
research things like issue identifier

73
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,150
numbers you'll have several different
websites that explain the first six

74
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,870
digits of the credit card quite in
detail including regions and and how

75
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,610
that impacts it the one algorithm is the
way to validate whether or not a credit

76
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,340
card number is active valid
mathematically is a partisan not really

77
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,549
but the principles still apply there so
I like it we're taking known given

78
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,630
information applying knowledge or
application of tools and producing

79
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:27,560
intelligence thinking like that gets me
a going over the last several exercises

80
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,790
I've done the last year on coming up
with the methodology this is the steps i

81
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,980
typically take when i'm looking at
intelligence online

82
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,500
we'll start with our known items or data
points all the time no see what's

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,050
already out there and and put it out
there

84
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,910
map it out just like the definition says
we're doing it for a reason so set your

85
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:54,660
intelligence goals what data are we
trying to get to based on what we see we

86
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,010
get our tools together and start you
know analyzing the known data points

87
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:06,210
that we have start to analyze how those
data points are connected and that will

88
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,890
pivot using the new data points we
cannot find out what else we can find

89
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,180
repeat the last three steps as necessary
gather analyze pivot and then validate

90
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,570
is our data correct target data
methodology everybody got a little

91
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,530
sleepy during that slide so we'll rename
it dosent connect the dots little more

92
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,229
fun and we'll throw in a nice case study
on it could be last year in october in

93
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,430
Colombia this new story came out on two
gentlemen and different vehicles get an

94
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,870
argument one pulls out a gun and fires
at the other guy crimestoppers through

95
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,860
this up looking for information
surveillance a picture came up big

96
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,970
bright green phone number on the side of
the shooters truck but they wanted some

97
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:56,100
more information on the guy starting
with known items out of the news story

98
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,190
we see Joseph Lamar Christmas is the the
name 839 the big bright green phone

99
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:09,420
number from the truck and area ties to
North Carolina and South Carolina we set

100
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,930
our goals you try to find a photo of
this guy give it to Crimestoppers

101
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,830
gather tools people online search for
information we get there on the phone

102
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,419
number from the truck and South Carolina
as a starting point and were given

103
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,750
Joseph Lamar Christmas 73 years old
couple of extra phone numbers couple

104
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,950
addresses and known associations likely
family members so we look at that stuff

105
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,060
side-by-side the the previous
information the new information and I

106
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:49,660
try to come up with some inferences from
that Joseph L Christmas age 73

107
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,010
potentially the targets father phone
number on the truck brings up the

108
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,189
father's info and not the target so
maybe we're looking at a family business

109
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:03,400
so let's look at the family a little bit
there i go back to my tools

110
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,290
Mike results until techniques he's got
an excellent social media search tools

111
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:15,069
online on his facebook search sets are
very useful on it's basically set up the

112
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,230
right side of the screen helps you find
an account or target and the left side

113
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,680
of the screen helps you dig into that
targets information so using the right

114
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,250
side very quickly i can find all of the
known associations from the people

115
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,250
search

116
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,920
inferences from that on its all family
members

117
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,420
there's no apparent account for the
target Joseph the Joseph L Christmas

118
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,420
that I found was the father's account
had very little use

119
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,880
so I start digging into the actual
accounts to try to find the Chatterbox

120
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,560
the family

121
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,939
Eleanor had no pictures Jay had no
pictures

122
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,090
mary had 20 pictures Jason had 27
pictures marker head 235 pictures

123
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:11,520
there's a chatterbox so I go back to the
cells left side of the screen on take

124
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:19,140
markets username and convert it to a
user account number on his to let you

125
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,449
start running data searches against the
user number with the facebook api on I

126
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:31,170
throw search against Joseph and Joe and
boom we just get a bunch of pictures

127
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,660
where she's tagged somebody named Joseph
pull up some emphasis there my brother

128
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:43,350
Joe that's my brother Joe so i think i
got the guy a couple different profile

129
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,190
shots

130
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,620
how do we validate rest made in road
rage shooting

131
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:59,640
holy crap i'm batman so good
common-sense alert don't leave your data

132
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,760
if you're into privacy and make sure
others aren't leaking the data as well

133
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,350
that's one of the things that most of us
don't think about is other people can

134
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,270
put our stuff out there and it happens
quite often now before you'll be in a

135
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,550
crimefighter talk real quick about
covering your tracks we all know soon as

136
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,420
somebody looks at our our linkedin
profile hey so-and-so checked you out on

137
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,290
you can see the people you may know
recommendations all over facebook and

138
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,569
twitter on so there's algorithms out
their facebook just let a story about

139
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,670
their 98 . creepy algorithm like there's
some stories where it's tagging a

140
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:41,760
psychiatrist patients and to friend each
other so obviously some issues out there

141
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,750
but a

142
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:50,340
it will rat you out so protect you are
fake name generator com is an excellent

143
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:56,010
source to create a sock puppet account
it'll give you a name that mother's

144
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,439
maiden name and occupation

145
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,830
I'm even get our burner email account
you can use with this information

146
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:09,360
automatically on there so you cover who
you are cover where you come from tour

147
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,010
tales virtual private networks and VMS
are great for this stuff tails is one of

148
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,760
my favorites it's a live operating
system that boot from a flash drive

149
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,510
I'm it automatically uses tore through
the network on the machine that you're

150
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:26,550
on preloaded with privacy and encryption
tools and when you shut it down it wipes

151
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:32,219
the ram from the system being a forensic
analyst that's kind of cool to see it's

152
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:42,390
also free talk a little bit about the
the tools that i use on posted framework

153
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:48,750
calm as an excellent resource it's set
up on the left side with 31 categories

154
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,950
of Intel each one of those cascades out
to multiple tools that you can use to a

155
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:58,589
drill into those categories at the time
of this talk there's about 690 tools on

156
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:05,790
they're all valid and pretty much free
or having trials already mentioned Intel

157
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,680
techniques by Mike Gesell on the the
free trial video that he's got on there

158
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,120
is about a 70 minute a primer to the
Facebook tools that i was using as well

159
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,180
with your time if you haven't used his
sight highly recommend he's got some

160
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,930
other stuff on there anytime I go to
social media center usually land on a

161
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:29,550
mikes website reason both of those tools
are so valid is because coson is a what

162
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,500
I call the land of dead tools sometimes
you'll have changes in the online

163
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,860
landscape constantly be it security or
privacy updates API changes on somebody

164
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,280
by somebody out transition something to
a paid business model and all the sudden

165
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,079
your tools are not working and sometimes
things just get abandoned we get busy

166
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,820
when we're trying to put our cool stuff
online for our friends on i did a

167
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:01,490
analysis i think 59 to list from 2012
about fifty eight percent of those were

168
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:07,550
still valid on just over 30-percent had
been no dead partially functional or

169
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:14,120
abandoned altogether on eleven percent
of them went to a page structure on so

170
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:21,290
there was quite a big fallout about
forty percent if you're in 20 sent these

171
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,770
are some of the guys that i recommend
paying attention to right now they're

172
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,810
out they're producing active projects
and giving good updates on their

173
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,880
microcells until techniques again he'll
shoot out an email monthly saying which

174
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:44,240
tools are you know coming off because of
outrage outdated on Justin sites he's

175
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,220
got a pretty good site automating ocean
where he's using a Python to automate

176
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,730
this process a bit on you know if you
want to get in the advanced side of it i

177
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,080
definitely recommend checking out his
his work on Justin nordine he runs the

178
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,730
ocean framework is it open to feedback
when you find an awesome tool and if you

179
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:07,460
find one that kinda sucks that it's just
let him know on Micah Hoffman sands

180
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,720
instructor he's got a website web
creature com has some excellent talks

181
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,890
and blog posts regarding the scent on so
for people to pay attention to their

182
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:25,640
alright posted speed round these are a
couple of the random exercises and stuff

183
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,330
I've done over the last year apparently
i like to locate stuff because most of

184
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,780
them involve taking the online content
and figuring out where they come from so

185
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:38,480
we'll kick through a few examples real
fast property data that's coming off the

186
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,790
ocean framework Melissa data website
pulls public record for locations by map

187
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:50,569
so what's most data say about the
property wearing right now get

188
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:56,810
approximate number of employees sales
figures on SIDS IC identification

189
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,699
numbers for classification of a type of
business there's a contact phone number

190
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,910
and information about the owners plus a
whole bunch of

191
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,990
property information they're highly
recommend that you plug your own address

192
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,160
into this and see where you're starting
points are somebody finds your address

193
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:20,900
and takes a look at what's on their wide
open webcams this one has a pretty clear

194
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,949
shot of the title logo and the IP
address geo-located to somewhere in

195
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:30,920
Texas fold it up and there was four
possible locations quick Google Maps

196
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,670
search

197
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,079
thank you know you got it from a random
picture that was a bad one it's not open

198
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,320
anymore but it also showed the
point-of-sale system directly on the

199
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,680
control camera that you can just kind of
look down at so no good

200
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,140
The Walking Dead I i had a trip to
Atlanta last year and the weekend after

201
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,250
i got back i just noticed something the
background you know that that attention

202
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,120
to detail comes in handy when you're
doing no sense stuff so hey that looks

203
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,080
really familiar back there so much a
little further I see another scene with

204
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,520
that same parking garage

205
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,589
you know what I walked right by there
pull up google earth all sudden get the

206
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:17,119
address 163 car anyway that's where the
tent zombies were in the Skywalk more

207
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,040
geolocation exif data is my favorite
especially as digital forensic analyst

208
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,750
on some website scrub it most of your
social media will pull it if you would

209
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,760
put a picture online bloggers are pretty
bad if they're using their own hosting

210
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,770
to not be pulling it found a shopping
blog with this photo obviously is taking

211
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,600
a picture of a cell phone with a
cellphone their back to the ocean

212
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,490
framework on cascading from the side
there you go images into meta data and

213
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,020
pull up Jeffries exit viewer pop that
picture on there and we're going to get

214
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,510
what model iphone he was using very
accurate date stamp on an address the

215
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,410
best part about some of these when
they're turned on is the the angle of

216
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,070
orientation where the where the person
was standing as they took that picture

217
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,860
exit that it's fun

218
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,600
validate the findings we pull it up on
google maps and flip the picture looks

219
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
pretty accurate

220
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,360
alright that I've got all of the links
from this talk on my website learn all

221
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,889
the things . net / creepy dosent on so
if you want to take a look at some of

222
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:33,290
the tools there's a lot of good blogs
and podcasts and stuff on there that if

223
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,620
you're interested in no sense i would
highly recommend checking those things

224
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:41,840
out on their one of those things where
you start getting into it in it you

225
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,280
watch something that starts making you
think of data and different way if you

226
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,270
want to get into it

227
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,299
spend some time on that the links that
throughout their if you have any

228
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:54,500
questions you can hit me up on email
that's me on twitter i'm at the old v8

229
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:05,059
on that's the end of my talk as I made
it any yes thanks and questions other

230
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,830
sir

231
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:14,418
so a lot of research that you're doing
your investigation was lying on the side

232
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:20,120
you have been meeting people in business
or other side

233
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,870
yeah and from a forensic standpoint I'm
very careful when I actually go out

234
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,760
online when it comes to an investigation
on the disclaimer most of my exercises

235
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,299
and stuff i did here we're definitely
not tied to a client work

236
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:40,580
I'm so if I've been able to kind of
incorporate Oh sent to some my forensic

237
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,189
stuff but i'm still kind of learning on
how far the Lord lawyers will take that

238
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,540
stuff when it comes to court and putting
in front of a judge so that's that's

239
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,540
something that I'm still kind of
figuring out at the moment

240
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,620
yeah thank you

241
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,740
yeah

242
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:12,860
private investigators dumpster dive a
lot it's completely legal to do it if

243
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,389
you put your stuff out on the curb

244
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,559
it's not your private property anymore
so I our guys will definitely go in the

245
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:29,690
trash if it behooves them for a case and
the questions certeza billion dollars

246
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:35,240
driving anymore is it just a result of
this picture on the day if it was me

247
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,710
yeah at the good we're going to do use
the shortcuts there on there's a whole

248
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,390
debate of whether or not you know social
engineering produces Oh sent you know we

249
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,980
talked about the ethical slide on now it
they've opened their mouths and made the

250
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,170
information public at that point so is
it a sin or did you get it in a crappy

251
00:20:54,170 --> 00:21:15,650
way mr. always away

252
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:31,149
the he's asking the public databases if
you look into the opt-out for some of

253
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:35,110
the sites like people and spokeo on I
don't have it in my slides but there's a

254
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:39,399
company that you can actually pay and
they'll go through and hit the the major

255
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:44,379
opt-out areas on to try to pull some of
your information back off the web on and

256
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:47,709
then if you really get into the guys
that are into privacy there's

257
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,990
misinformation is one of the the big
ways that you cannot do that one of the

258
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:58,690
podcasts and my extended links has a
gazelle talking about signing up for I

259
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,590
think omaha steaks with bogus
information or partially bogus

260
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,820
information you use your real address
and a fake name or you know your real

261
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,689
name in a bad address and sign up for
some of these sites that are you know

262
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,320
the value pack coupon company that
turnaround and poached that to everybody

263
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,240
under the sun and you you will create
quite a deceptive trail of your own

264
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:27,580
information doing that right now any
other questions thanks guys appreciate

265
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,240
you coming out
