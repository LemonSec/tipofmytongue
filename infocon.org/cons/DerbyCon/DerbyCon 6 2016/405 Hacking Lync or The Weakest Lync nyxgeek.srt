1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,040
I was already doing good yeah everything
awesome so I'm next week I'm going to

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,520
talk today a little bit about hacking
microsoft lync our skype for business as

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,150
it's now called i guess uh first the
obligatory who am i I'm a pen tester for

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,500
trusted sec general security enthusiasts
it's my first time here

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,210
it's been a blast so far and i'm going
to be full disclosure I'm not like an

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,430
admin I don't set up link i'm not an
architect I i'm not a pro at the back

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,680
and configuration of it but what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna show you a little

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,180
bit about things like found that you can
use to attack so let's take a look here

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,890
quick and see what the link setup is
light in order to do this I use the test

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,010
drive from Microsoft you can download it
it's a little bit old you like to renew

11
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,629
your search in it if you're going to use
it but you need for BM 16 gigs around

12
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,250
minimum so it's a little bit heavy but
yeah for machines running the only

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,220
important machines are the server friend
the domain controller exchange server

14
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,189
and then the web app servers you need
those for in order to set up a working

15
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:18,149
link test drive so that in this I'm
gonna take you through an attack

16
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,380
overview first we're gonna like look at
locating the linked servers they're

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,369
pretty easy to find their go through
domain enumeration user numeration and

18
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,689
then the things you can do once you've
found those pieces of the puzzle so the

19
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,740
first thing to do is to locate them a
link discovered that whatever domain.com

20
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,060
you can scan the internet for these
it'll actually . into the real linked

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,810
server that student of the link front
end server so in this case you can see

22
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,680
here the 2013 link that confirms the
back on Microsoft's you know domain so

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,369
that's where actually all the fun stuff
is find this an appoint you to wear the

24
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,950
goodies are I'm the front end server
there's two main areas that are kind of

25
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,659
interesting one is the dial-in of page
and the other is a scheduler page and

26
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,610
they're just interesting gives her
single factor sign on and they allow you

27
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,980
to to actually reach in and touch ad
accounts are looking at this little

28
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,849
closer this is what you'll see i just
have a message that hosts shopping etc

29
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,980
hosts file so you won't be able to go to
that URL obviously but you you click the

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,590
Sign In button you get another page
where they asked for a domain username

31
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,010
and password and then here's the
scheduler one that's what that one looks

32
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,390
like now

33
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:35,390
aah both of these when you go to login
just post an xml doc up there this is a

34
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,230
cleaned-up version so you can see
there's a couple areas here i want to

35
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,328
focus on one is the username token you
can see that's just basically four

36
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:49,579
encoded it's a without a new line and
its domain / username so you can do an

37
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:54,950
echo yeah to get that and then I you can
also see they actually have in here that

38
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,328
created time and expires time but
spoiler alert they don't do anything

39
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,870
early is not in my experience you can
still attack with it you don't need to

40
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,680
update that also just forget about it
it's there but it's I don't know why

41
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,760
another thing that's kind of interesting
about this link friends or visitor's a

42
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,649
number of ntlm off problems that you can
get you so these are great for brute

43
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,970
forcing against so there's one of the
web ticket service and then there's one

44
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,340
under the address book synchronization
folder i don't think that you can deny

45
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,730
access the WebKit service because that's
what that post goes to so unless you're

46
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,869
not going to use dial and scheduler you
have to have that exposed as far as i

47
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,470
know you can't do anything about it
except for to disable and PM off and go

48
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,919
search based so during my scans of the
internet look at the fortune 1000 list

49
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:48,019
from 2015 52-percent had dns entries for
link discover not home or actively

50
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,519
pointing to something early so in the
end about forty percent a dial-in page

51
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,930
exposing 42 at the MGM all you get to
the electron knowing that drops down but

52
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:03,290
that makes sense right because he's
running like big companies so yeah so

53
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,879
next we're going to domain numeration
it's super simple easy with this and

54
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,720
after the rescue here you can just run
an nmap script for the HTTP and $TIME

55
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,530
p.m. info and that will give you the
internal domain name so even if it's not

56
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,889
apparently if it's not obvious from the
external world like it's not posted a

57
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,220
comment is I can't also internal or
something it wouldn't matter shop there

58
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,940
so you need that for the login so now
let's look at the user enumeration here

59
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,060
there's a standard OS and right you do a
site search on Google for site tour com

60
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,990
file type PDF and you scrape the
metadata of that oftentimes companies

61
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,260
will have user names in that metadata
that you can use at least figure out

62
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,900
what kind of format they're using
whether it's you know first initial last

63
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,039
name first name last initial whatever
that's an easy way to kind of get an

64
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,060
idea but there's also a timing attack
you can do against those two web pages

65
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,730
that will reveal the real user names for
you in that yet

66
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,580
that's where you submit the post request
and if it's a valid username you'll get

67
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,340
a really short response if it's an
invalid one it'll take considerably

68
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,159
longer so cover this yet you can only
single thread it seems so here's a

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,300
basket i just could curl right and I
time my curl so you can see here is the

70
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,350
valid his name is about half a second
and invalid took like four and a half

71
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,360
seconds so it also seems to depend on
the size of the domain how many users

72
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,710
there are I not a hundred percent on
that but it definitely seems to be that

73
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,000
the larger company

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
the bigger the time lapse that you that
you see between the 2i and you can only

75
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,220
single-threaded i noticed if you tried
doing multiple threads there the time

76
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,120
and get skewed kind of its not as clean
you can't see it as easily which account

77
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,410
value which are so I'd recommend just
try to find kind of the the base pattern

78
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,430
and then generate some off that use that
to run through and find the valid ones

79
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,610
that way so i did tell microsoft about
this back in June and they're like oh

80
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,300
thanks

81
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,140
they got back within 24 hours telling me
that they did not care also i mean it's

82
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,800
not like a remote code execution or
anything but it doesn't have to be there

83
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,190
I guess is the thing that could a random
climber into that and fix it so so you

84
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,360
can do the timing attack / sweet it's
not as reliable as doing it another way

85
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,320
which is with python or the batch script
but it's easy to get a GUI right i mean

86
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,180
so add a prefix and basically for code
but also make sure you drop out that

87
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:31,919
payload encoding because that will screw
you with the basics far so here's just

88
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,890
an example i'm going to be putting up
the Python code for this it's really

89
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,550
simple that all you're doing is
submitting that

90
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,050
quest right so if you can write Python
you can write a post that old you a lot

91
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,070
take a username list and koda and in
this you can see here so try guessing

92
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,450
which ones are the valid ones based off
of the short timing be valid right so I

93
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,070
said the word Alex because they have a
number of alex's in that built-in domain

94
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:01,300
that built in that test drive so this
year we got an alice eve got analysis s

95
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:09,040
and then alex w so those are all valid
where the other ones are not so now what

96
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,730
we know the domain name we've got
usernames we got a couple places you can

97
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,470
try these out o.o what do we want to do
with those there's a couple things that

98
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,430
you can do with it

99
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,320
there's the the lockouts and brute force
attacks which is what we're gonna be

100
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,670
looking at here come back out so the
kind of lame right i mean it's a toss

101
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:33,340
attack but uh so first of all because
you can hit any account any company

102
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,750
exists you can restrict 20 you will be
contacted microsoft about it and various

103
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,930
constantly sauce was we basically have
to rewrite the product in order to do

104
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,940
that and i'm not sure how that works

105
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,930
I don't know how they wrote that it's
like that but you can hit administrator

106
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,560
accounts you can hit any service
accounts anybody's account you can find

107
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,290
you can lock them out you can attack
them you can do whatever with them it's

108
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,790
fun so a few questions to think about
right in your environment you have

109
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,390
separate admin accounts from your
regular user accounts index do they

110
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,409
unlock automatically after sometime or
if I'm a jerk and I run through and I

111
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,950
like all your console are you a lot
about real for like forever

112
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,390
so yeah those are some things to think
about here with this being exposed

113
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,469
externally what people really do if they
wanted to be a jerk to you

114
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:25,150
so the other thing that i would
recommend doing a do a brute force

115
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,539
attack against them right you can go
wide against all usernames the

116
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,450
traditional summer 2016 you know fall
2016 whatever company name one company

117
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,240
name one bang and you can use burp suite
for this or you can use Medusa against

118
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,710
the ntlm auth page directories reduces
pretty fast and then purpose find you

119
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,920
just look for the 208 estimate with that
expiration time

120
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,610
I waited 12 hours and I replayed it
again same thing you get the 200 on the

121
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,830
ballot username password and you get the
500 if it's invalid so yeah that token

122
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,890
i'm not sure why they even include the
expiration date in there so if we're

123
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,600
going to set up the brute force with the
burp speed the timing doesn't matter

124
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,980
just remember to do do this debate that
prefix contoso and then the base64

125
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,570
encode and then use yeah take off the
payload encoding there or else you won't

126
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,410
we won't work properly I was banging my
head against the wall I was trying to do

127
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,969
something like this works

128
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:29,270
what's wrong here oh right like my equal
signs are gonna encoded 3d okay great so

129
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,470
remember to do that here's kind of just
an example quick this is what you'll see

130
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,530
when you actually do a burpee back with
it

131
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:41,329
yeah you get the 200 different response
length of course versus the five

132
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,810
hundreds of the shorter shorter length
of the file

133
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:52,219
alright so next we're going to take a
look at medusa here's hopefully can read

134
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,530
that in the back i know it's kind of
small

135
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:58,490
I'm gonna run throughout just a live
demo of it quick and open a bit here but

136
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,440
I'm so you can see it works fine you
just a with this were just using a user

137
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:11,660
list just was my group of names and then
summer 2016 7 modules HTTP and specify

138
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,160
SL right and then just saw the directory
to the abs or the web service ticket

139
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,939
directory so so far we've taken a look
at we found the internal lumen phone

140
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,880
user names and then we've been able to
attack someone so we're what we do now

141
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,480
let me now that we've now that we have
these things well what we do here so I

142
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,310
more like favorite things to do is when
you're on a pen test and you find some

143
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,010
user names like this you don't
necessarily know who the user names

144
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,100
belong to write you might either be a
number or maybe a first name last name

145
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,340
but you can't really figure out who they
are so one of my favorite things to do

146
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,350
that is to go to LinkedIn right

147
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,490
also i skipped a separate first we're
gonna log into that dial-in page that we

148
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,920
saw it will actually show you the guys
username there is real and

149
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,130
you don't need to do anything you can
just cancel out of that you're fine but

150
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,480
you then have a person's real name that
you can go to lincoln co are they an IT

151
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,500
director who are true is it a worthwhile
account use or should we move on to the

152
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,720
next person should I keep going

153
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,790
so that's a fun thing to go through and
do let's see what else can we do here

154
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:25,829
single-factor login pages if you can
find like the company internet page or

155
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,279
wa or if you're in if you're close by
them you might be looking on their

156
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,149
wireless with these these credentials
that you got from link so I mean that

157
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:38,370
there's playing that you can do with it
now this . think we're just gonna run

158
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:56,370
and jump into here fucking bear with me
for a moment who i read especially

159
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:13,800
alright so first we're just going to
show finding the domain i just wrote

160
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,890
these into a basket so be easy to run
through here but it'll show you the

161
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,689
commandments run so we're running the
command nmap with the script and we can

162
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:26,070
see I did indeed returns this so this is
actually service being posted out of my

163
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,579
apartment sitting in our closets a 1u
server that we could support forward

164
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:33,870
into so and then i added yo hostname
into right center hosts file just so we

165
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,910
can look at it this way so there's that
right there

166
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:51,000
let's look at this one should be so what
this python script is doing is just

167
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,850
taking a username list right and this is
the the same one I showed you a

168
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,779
screenshot of but in real time can kind
of see something that you might want to

169
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:03,750
do is to send a fake name first see kind
of what a baseline is that you have for

170
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,130
what the invalid user names are and then
from there you can figure okay half of

171
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,360
that or less is going to be a valid
username it's usually are

172
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,310
and it almost certainly under half the
invalid response time so that's

173
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,119
something to be aware of you can
probably do some cool maths there and

174
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,170
figure out kind of what would be a good
way to just filter between them

175
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,620
I just been using you know looking at it
saying okay let's look through here

176
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,230
where is the pattern because people are
really good at detecting batteries

177
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,709
computer sometimes aren't unless you
tell us how to do it correctly so I mean

178
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:41,149
it's not the most efficient way
necessarily but it definitely works and

179
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:49,490
then from here let's look at so here
we're just gonna run reduce against it

180
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:56,300
and it's quick it runs through you find
you're gonna find it in the bigger

181
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,180
environments you're definitely gonna
find multiple people that have these bad

182
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,589
passwords I mean it's just it's how it
goes people are people of their

183
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,329
predictable they choose things

184
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,630
oh I precepts every 90 days they're
going to choose ones that are cyclical

185
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,070
nature or yeah otherwise easy to guess
that way so I mean the one thing you

186
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,970
have to worry about is locking out a
concentrate so I was testing at one

187
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,810
place that I used to work and I
accidentally I was running this

188
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,050
overnight looking for some weak
passwords and I completely forgot about

189
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,649
our offshore resources and I might have
locked out a few hundred people for over

190
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:31,820
20 minutes so be careful right

191
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,470
be aware that these aren't that kidding
ad they are counting against the lockout

192
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,860
so just be careful if you're
experimenting in your office or anywhere

193
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:48,320
because you might ruffle a few feathers
for it by doing it I and then a senior

194
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:57,839
and we're doing this this way

195
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:22,620
alright start with this where it's going
to run this with just one username in

196
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,790
here and all its gonna do is it's going
to run at five times just to kind of

197
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:36,839
show you that you can indeed lockout
accounts hear that right

198
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:43,680
Oh memory so let's do this manually and
said it'll be just as easy

199
00:15:48,839 --> 00:16:01,620
alright so if you go to the base
directory here on any of these linked

200
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,259
servers you'll just get the standard for
three forbidden here so uh what you

201
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:12,930
here's the ABS page here you'll get the
NPRM problem are all from there we can

202
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:19,349
just talk so / administrator one will
see the color so let's take on the

203
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,529
thickness route there are a few times i
think i just one set to do it after five

204
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:33,360
so that should should be enough ok let's
just pop over here I've got to rdp

205
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,829
session open and we'll just do a search
for the lockout comes here but did

206
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:43,500
alright good yeah you can see the
administrator account is locked out

207
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,019
so in if you have renamed the
administrator conference of prime target

208
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:53,519
somebody's watching this genius and mess
with your company right like I also ya

209
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,749
goin back to that domain admin account
if you're using a certain naming

210
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:00,780
convention and they can figure out what
the naming convention is

211
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,079
it might be a plumber to come in one day
and find that all you da concert locked

212
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,569
out or service accounts like if you have
things that run on let's say batch

213
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:14,490
processing at night things that run at
night time that are very critical and

214
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,670
you can discover those username so make
those long if you can I guess is the

215
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,050
best advice I can give you there because
you can group force I did that some

216
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,800
sampling and i would take about a
hundred forty days I think to

217
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,480
realistically cover up to eight
characters were forcing so anything

218
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,570
under eight i would say it's probably
not safe from being discovered be a

219
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,820
brute force attack so yeah that things
to consider if you're running link on

220
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:45,030
your on your network so let's go back
here

221
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:57,570
alright so we've covered this up talking
about protecting a little bit what can

222
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,389
you do you can configure to factor on
there

223
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,010
I i am of the opinion that you just
require v tienda to access that I know

224
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,890
it's not gonna be it's gonna fly
everywhere because part of the dial in

225
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,490
the schedulers that you cannot to talk
with other companies you can have

226
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,400
external people jump in with you can
disable the MGM off that's kind of an

227
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,190
issue because you need something to be
there in person first

228
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,150
as far as i understand like i said i'm
not an admin for link but this is what I

229
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,930
found as far as what seems to be the
most reliable way to solve it is to

230
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:32,820
disable the ntlm off that'll save you a
lot of hassle there or really put a

231
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,290
weapon front if you cannot all
restricted research connection attempts

232
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,340
by IP that'll really personally fairly
quick trying to message that you can

233
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,750
spin up like an Amazon bottle i guess
i'll be one way to get around this if

234
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,740
you wanted to hit for multiple keys but
your normal run-of-the-mill person isn't

235
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,460
going to go to the effort I think to
attack it from multiple angles

236
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,620
so those are some ways that you can
actually protect it because this is a

237
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,770
small smaller firms anybody have any
questions that i can tell you about

238
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:11,010
anybody have any questions on the taxes
yet so i haven't actually looked at the

239
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:28,080
office 365 that much so I I can't really
see other questions all right okay well

240
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,889
I'm sorry talking about this business
the link-up renamed right right i have

241
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,990
tried again . if that's what you're
wondering

242
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,380
so that's something that would be fun to
test our patience is right for anything

243
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,450
for you and I don't really have the
means to set all this up on my own so

244
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,899
yeah it's something something to
definitely look at the hopefully that

245
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:51,779
you fix some of these things especially
the only one is I think it's ridiculous

246
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:56,010
that you can reach out and touch
anything environment and how that exists

247
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:04,740
so that open up the x-acto knives
ex-service part of this

248
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,270
no I have not I this is everything I've
done here just gonna wrap revolving

249
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:14,039
around you know from kind of the website
of things and Esther side but I haven't

250
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,200
I'm not into sipperley or any of the
XMPP stuff like that it's outside of all

251
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,679
hearts but so I guess yeah if we just
want to look at the the problems that

252
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,299
there are with link here

253
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,860
yeah we can remotely lockout accounts
you can restrict those login attempts to

254
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,120
any specific or use we have multiple
platforms that don't implement any type

255
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,469
of authorization token any cross-site
request forgery tokens that might help

256
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,799
stop forbidden fruit was slamming away
at then they don't they don't uh look at

257
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,510
the timestamp center in there so I mean
I say it's poorly implemented than the

258
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,289
directories that are exposed that you
can just hammer on with Medusa also a

259
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:58,809
problem and then of course the user
information timing attacks in

260
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:02,440
they're so i think that if you're
looking at opening up a link to the

261
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,470
outside world i mean illogical do it
there's around fifty percent

262
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,669
organizations in the top 1000 fortune
1000 do this but if you're thinking

263
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:14,649
about doing that you know these are all
things to consider with that that kind

264
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:18,610
of move through here faster than i was
anticipating so I apologize for that for

265
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,120
that

266
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,668
so with that yeah good for business you
are the weakest link so that thanks

267
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:25,360
provided
