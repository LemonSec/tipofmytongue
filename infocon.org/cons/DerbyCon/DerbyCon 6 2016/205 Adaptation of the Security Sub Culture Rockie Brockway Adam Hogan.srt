1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,569
okay so we're gonna start and I'm going
to keep an eye on this whole piece of

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,940
trying our level technical difficulties
and because of this because of this

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,400
awful piece of technology we do not have
soundtrack which we work very hard

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,320
it happens I'll keep an eye on ya serve
them

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,490
ok anyway thanks for comin out despite
our our difficulties i'm adam Hogan and

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,809
I am rocky Brock word our files are in
the book but what we want to talk about

7
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,578
is how to change a subculture some the
difficulties that come with it and what

8
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:46,829
we might learn from punk rock so from an
agenda perspective we're going to kind

9
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:53,879
of outline some goals right at the end
of the day everybody here at this

10
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,940
conference and those of you who have a
tendency to migrate to other cities and

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,518
and hang out with other people of
similar mindsets in this community we

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:14,159
are a subculture ok and as a subculture
we have the ability to influence culture

13
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,680
mainstream culture so there's a number
of challenges around that but the goal

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,200
really you know new so we're going to be
talking about what our goals are from a

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,100
high-level what these challenges happen
actually be we're going to walk through

16
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,770
some group theory is this guy home you
guys on let's turn it on

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,240
we're going to walk through some some
group theory and look at some case

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,360
studies and talk about complexity theory
look at some case studies

19
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,610
we're going to talk about adaptation and
how systems and organizations even

20
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,310
organisms and therefore organizations
adapt and try to wrap it all together

21
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,620
with some interesting kind of take

22
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,620
ways from our recommendations
perspective alright

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:10,030
explore the back so why care i do the
stable talk here the background of this

24
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,830
talk was basically i'm probably getting
closer that I should start walking

25
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,080
around so the background of that talk
was in the nineties in the eighties and

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:30,550
nineties i was in this indie rock math
rock band and the we released or records

27
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,210
three of which were recorded by steve
albini of anybody has an idea who that

28
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,290
guy is

29
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:42,280
and so those first three records that we
released in the early nineties just kind

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,810
of missed the whole internet streaming
you know technology subset so a bunch of

31
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,270
lunatic fans about two years ago decided
to put together a kickstarter and they

32
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:03,040
raise twenty six thousand dollars to
basically take the old tapes we release

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,739
them into digital format get them back
in to get them into itunes spotify and

34
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,390
all that stuff which it didn't exist in
at the time because all those records

35
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,510
were out of print being from an indie
label that a bunch of indie labels that

36
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,179
had you know basically blown their wad
over a couple years and then disappear

37
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,970
right and as part of this kickstarter
that they put together they also

38
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,209
released the collective recordings of
the band in a 6lp box set with a

39
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,250
200-page history of the bands so this is
really kind of cool

40
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,230
from my perspective since you know that
was really kind of a hobby of mine as i

41
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,238
was building my info SEC career so the
talk that I did last year which is kind

42
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,239
of hey you know you know what I've
noticed being in both of these kind of

43
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,000
subcultures here are some similarities
and here's some things that we can kind

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,530
of like shared wall this guy happen to
be watching that talk and within an hour

45
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,960
or so I think

46
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,560
email me this long list like hey that
was really interesting you can really do

47
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,080
much more than you know we can really
extrapolate you know from your original

48
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,070
topic into some really cool things like
group theory involving so there's kind

49
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,580
of part of it it was a really long email
and I'm provo yeah he's very remote and

50
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,789
so my response was that's really cool

51
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,460
put your money where your mouth is let's
let's do a talk with now we got here if

52
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,729
you're looking for a way to talk at your
next conference maybe just her at the

53
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,480
speaker look at the pretty much world
only work

54
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:51,690
ok so let's talk about some goals right
we all here throughout this industry

55
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:58,170
that we need to change security culture
there's an inherent problem with that

56
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:05,010
right because what ends up being the the
reality is that there's these underlying

57
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:12,570
subcultures within the overarching
corporate mainstream and so as well

58
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,849
we'll kind of talk about as we move
forward here there are very very

59
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:25,830
patterned and historical difficulties in
changing a culture so we're going to

60
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,950
help you understand how you can try and
influence the wider culture right so

61
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,750
let's I understand what is how it
changes high input the change and we can

62
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,630
try to about right

63
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,990
good now we all accept that difficult
right getting ready to change the

64
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,690
culture and handling it so that's not
new we're not breaking any ground there

65
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:48,210
but we want to get into how we blend the
ideas we have back into the mainstream

66
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,840
right we're gonna spend an entire
weekend agreeing with each other and

67
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,489
cornerback we know how to do it

68
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,730
user awful day we told him in a
wonderful right well how right when i

69
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:05,730
learned how to get those ideas back into
the rescue organization right so when we

70
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,610
were moving to challenge right one of
the challenges that we face today

71
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,550
basically security culture change is
attempting to change user assumptions

72
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,529
beliefs etc are changing

73
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:21,539
check changing beliefs is you know
two-degree almost like that's a popular

74
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,558
belief system if you believe that you
don't need to reuse that if you don't

75
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:30,869
need to change your password for every
different website that you attend that

76
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:37,049
you are you have a log into well that's
your own personal belief system is very

77
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:42,568
difficult to change it is akin to you
know religious beliefs and political

78
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:50,519
beliefs right and and because we try to
you know corporations try to change

79
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:56,129
these belief systems from a top-down
perspective right here's a mandated

80
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:59,669
policy that you need to read you know
have a different password for every

81
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:06,688
whatever every website that's where all
of this really kind of fall apart right

82
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:12,989
the mandated top-down policy is not
going to change the end-users belief

83
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:20,099
system we want to the point where we can
encourage creativity but there's going

84
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,549
to be obvious limit right it's an
awfully creative paying it had to on

85
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:27,659
your faith but it might be too far i can
really go to the experimentation night

86
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:32,069
when we created whether certain limit
there and we know that there's an

87
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:36,929
outlier subculture that's why we like
that on it's great to be around till the

88
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:40,768
rest of the Nerds our entire weekend
right that an amazing experience

89
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:45,479
why we come here and what a great extent
of contract to meeting our heads and our

90
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,008
death and trying to convince him around

91
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:53,429
listen to us to rent the year right ah
and we know we're going to be a little

92
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:56,698
isolated we're all here because you
loved it right either

93
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:01,259
I handled stumble into security with the
most part were here in a bad way

94
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,709
spending our weekend to come at the
conference because the absolutely love

95
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:09,269
with stop going to make it a little
isolated yeah inherently and and you

96
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,229
know again this the people that go on
other way to come to something like a

97
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:18,779
derby con or any you know intersect /
hacker type conference were all really

98
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:23,879
kind of the same mindset we like to
break things and and and you know figure

99
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,929
out how they work and potentially fix
them right potentially not all of us you

100
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:28,448
know

101
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,339
we have the red vs blue and all that
stuff but so along those same lines

102
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:39,370
right Patrick gray who runs who has his
risky business podcast he always talks

103
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:48,190
about you you can't teach someone to
love punk rock they just do right and

104
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:54,760
the same thing really kind of applies
for information security alright but you

105
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,939
know is it is it feasible right can we
mentor and train someone who's not wild

106
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,100
about the 24th that right that's where
we are to its scaling problem first one

107
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,130
higher than willing to live and breathe
this stuff are our passion for this

108
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:14,529
industry is what drives a lot of our
productivity why we're in the top brand

109
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,360
but no one's got enough people right now
we're . working we've got two without

110
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,880
hiring more people and that you probably
hiring people who come five o'clock one

111
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,120
stop thinking about information theory
and maybe that's a little weird for

112
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,899
someone with it the only way to tell but
we have to be able to reach out across

113
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:37,990
are very isolated subcultures you are
reach out of the fridge and get you do

114
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:44,529
to people who are willing to learn if
not from a wildly borderline of death

115
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:49,420
example right right all of us in here
for the most part are probably following

116
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,949
in their category of this is what we do
and we really like what we do we can be

117
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:58,630
very frustrated about the lack of
results and really this entire talk is

118
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,560
about how we can fix those like a result
because most of us are probably really

119
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:10,479
good at what we do but you know we're
not seeing the culture change and and

120
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,920
this really like you know it from my
perspective it's really really important

121
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,560
to try to find some of those fringe
really you know talented outliers who

122
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,660
can communicate with the business can
communicate with the people and

123
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,329
potentially find others within the
organization that they might not have

124
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:35,920
the same passion about what we do but
they kind of get it and kinda like it

125
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,089
this could be a nine-to-five job right
contributing to the entire system

126
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,850
so recognizing those challenges that
we're going to have to make it happen to

127
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,980
get a culture change let's try and dive
into the music right so let's start with

128
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,650
the definition that is suitably standard
a little dull place to start right but

129
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,459
they didn't you know from Webster right
didn't definition i think actually is

130
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,780
going to help understand because the
standard very lazy definition of

131
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,880
corporate culture it it's the way we do
think okay look a little bit deeper than

132
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,240
that

133
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,990
this one is different from major shine
is a culture of the pattern of shared

134
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,430
tacit assumption that was learned by the
group as it's all problems right because

135
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,750
they worked well and we could and were
considered valid to get that those

136
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,650
illusions are talking to members and
that what team roles become the culture

137
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,810
right so it's not an accident

138
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,310
it's not you know we just happen to have
this culture that would learn all those

139
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,459
behaviors are learned and ultimately
because someone decides this is the way

140
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,450
that works right someone's right it's
all the problem they came up with a way

141
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:46,030
that work and that where the culture
grew out right now that also tells a bit

142
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,079
why it difficult to change culture right
culture and written up on the whiteboard

143
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,980
you can't erase it one day right up the
new corporate culture because that all

144
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,610
learned behavior and you don't want only
unlearn the way we've been doing things

145
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,890
right you have to actually now show
different solution you have to leave and

146
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,480
get people to learn a new way of doing
things that will roll into being I'll

147
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,790
wider corporate culture right now it
also can show us why sometimes corporate

148
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,610
culture goals in the wrong direction
right because learned behavior doesn't

149
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,760
mean you're right you can learn the
wrong way to do things right

150
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,839
I'm always reminded of Skinner's pigeon
right this charisma first behavioral

151
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,270
psychology experiment where he had like
them half star pigeon any drop some food

152
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:28,990
in there

153
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:34,270
well the pigeon develop superstition if
they were turning clockwise in a circle

154
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,540
and the food came out next time they get
hungry during clockwise in the circle

155
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,640
they were convinced they had some active
control right and now that's becoming

156
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,150
part of their culture their learning
this behavior is not right but they

157
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,589
think it and that the know right i'm
making fun of these pigeons for their

158
00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:54,550
ridiculous superstitions i'm wearing my
lucky conscience so it's not

159
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,790
totally related to these ridiculous
visions right now is wet weather whether

160
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,510
there's any logic to it or not if we
have to learn illusion that part of the

161
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:11,860
culture so here here's what I would like
you to ask yourself right

162
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,529
do you think that your security
organization should be able to change

163
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,660
and adapt

164
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:26,319
alright so we're kind of at a high level
touched upon culture and subcultures but

165
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,890
at the end of the day the organization
needs to figure out whether this is

166
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,670
possible

167
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,849
alright so once you ask yourself that

168
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:46,630
now ask do you think your organization
is capable of changing and adapting and

169
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:52,300
that's the much bigger question that you
know hopefully as we kind of walk

170
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:59,890
through this set of checkup positive
hypotheses you know that hopefully we

171
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,029
can help your organization's begin to
really kind of change and adapt by

172
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:08,230
thinking about things a little more in
terms of subculture and how that can

173
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:14,890
affect culture so let's talk about group
theory how one of the way that

174
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,640
inherently affect our behavior how we
work with a team is whether we hear that

175
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,140
part of the team and this is actually
like a fundamental part of our

176
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:30,100
psychology the way that actually studied
in the lab and we offer station topic is

177
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,270
my my graduate work within behavior like
now always studying the lab start to

178
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,569
look at studying you know altruism or
cooperative he'd really done is

179
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:43,600
experiments around game where the rule
are very strictly defined every probably

180
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,209
heard of the prisoner's dilemma is
certainly the most popular experiment

181
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:51,399
second is the ultimatum game and I throw
how we decide work on the design ideas

182
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,089
all true

183
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,790
the game goes like that there's two
people playing the game I don't know

184
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,390
each other completely anonymous you
never get to each other get player a

185
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,630
gets a hundred-dollar and get to decide
how much of it to give the player DVD

186
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:07,329
player B decide whether to accept or
reject the offer if you accept they both

187
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:08,170
get the money if you

188
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:16,240
Jack nobody get any of the money so if
people are perfectly rational why would

189
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,990
they ever turn down free money free
money free money

190
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:25,750
great hit better than no money but even
if it's like one percent right now

191
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,440
that's not what happened to run the
experiment in the lab and people

192
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,959
routinely reject offered that are no
less than forty thirty percent right

193
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,888
there have been found routinely and not
just four hundred dollars they went and

194
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,389
did these experiments off on new guinea
with the equivalent of three months

195
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:48,190
salary they were offering these people
three months salary at that wall but you

196
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,870
get more will screw both of us right and
reject the offer they both got nothing

197
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,959
so we have inherent ideas baby way into
our firm we're not going anywhere of

198
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:06,010
walk to fair and with not defend right
so i mentioned that the things you don't

199
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,269
take to get to this that that framework
is it done it with a lot of different

200
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:14,920
variable to explore that and one of the
interesting experiment is my group

201
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,729
membership a lot of experience look at
okay well what's the difference then in

202
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,540
what offered and was accepted based on
whether they're the you know from the

203
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,019
same country whether they're the same
religion the same race if they're part

204
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:29,560
of the same group and they do in fact
find that people are more likely to

205
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,989
cooperate of people who are part of the
same group is now they went on to see

206
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,850
just how deep that ran and found wasn't
that important right

207
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,970
you think okay yeah I for the team Kanye
for the same religion yeah you're pretty

208
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,899
close right now

209
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,680
nothing beats family tie that's way up
there forcing you cooperate your family

210
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,979
more than anybody else after that it
kind of called part they found that the

211
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,199
groups were actually completely
arbitrary point where they ran the

212
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:59,469
experiment what is that ok we're going
to buy group your team read your team

213
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,179
green and they found the exact same
result so I want to read

214
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:09,370
nobody bring that he's been in red for
all five minute so don't know what it

215
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,859
mean like in green

216
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:16,658
nobody's got all right so this
inherently part of our psychology if we

217
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:19,360
if we start carving people often failure
and the team here on this

218
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,099
name we are literally fixing and people
brain how well they're going to work

219
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,928
each other and how they're going to
cooperate with each other

220
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:35,470
Red Team Blue team and I are so familiar
so PBS Frontline had a really

221
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:45,850
interesting piece called a class divided
in I believe 6800 my way right after

222
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,540
Martin so Martin Luther King jr. was
just been assassinated i believe that

223
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:56,168
was 68 and this third grade teacher
basically in order to try to explain to

224
00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:04,390
her students in her third-grade class
about why this man was assassinated put

225
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,040
together basically what was a
discrimination exercise a little bit

226
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:16,510
controversial right but she basically
took the class and said okay now it's

227
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:24,280
well known that all blue eyed people are
smarter than brown eyed people

228
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:31,299
ok and so you brown eyed people you're
probably going to have a little bit more

229
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:39,070
difficulty in life because the blue-eyed
people inherently are smart and the kids

230
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,899
all absorb that and you know they
started kind of like dividing within the

231
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:50,590
class and all that the next day she
basically said Oh to the class I i'm

232
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,100
wrong i misspoke right

233
00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:01,510
brown eyed people are smarter than blue
eyed people completely reversed the next

234
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,720
day completely reversed it and they ate
it up right now and to the point where

235
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,620
you

236
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,659
yeah hey that person do that person
failed this map quiz part typical

237
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,070
brown-eyed behavior

238
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,270
yeah alright yeah the kids bought into
it right away it's a little creepy lot

239
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:23,320
yeah and yeah it's not entirely sure if
you're supposed to remind your students

240
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:30,440
right that's a little yeah I kind of
have a little bit of respect for that

241
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,200
aspect and level of experimentation
normal but there is this 60 they didn't

242
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:43,669
have informed consent so we're looking
at a real double-edged sword here we

243
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:47,929
know there are great things that coupled
with being a part of a strong team right

244
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:51,890
everybody thinks be treated in the great
idea right we're all proud of the

245
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,630
country come from but I think about you
can all name a few different times or

246
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,820
strong for each of them led people to
war

247
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:09,740
alright the double-edge part right so we
we all really kind of inherent value the

248
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,950
concept of being on a strong team but
there are also dangers to that will kind

249
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,880
of get into that as we get into like
complexity . and whatnot but you know

250
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:26,870
and at the end of the day a very strong
team has a really into a really a decent

251
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,049
probability of alienating itself

252
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:35,090
ok but we start talking about clicks and
things of that nature right this info

253
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:41,780
SEC culture subculture here right we
have a tendency to have a hard time with

254
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:49,730
the end users and the challenges that we
face trying to communicate security up

255
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:55,730
into the business right so there comes a
time when these strong subcultures end

256
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,169
up alienating themselves and just kind
of building wall and when that happens

257
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:10,159
they become ineffective right really
need a way to bridge the culture right

258
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,640
because i did not a template knocking
down the wall i'm not going to work

259
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,919
right we're here because we're on

260
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,220
well that's not going to go away and we
don't want to get rid of the passion

261
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,909
that drive them all right now we're
going away to bridge the culture I think

262
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,880
some of them pretty example about that
right it's not that we have to break

263
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,640
apart that but maybe we need an
ambassador

264
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,899
alright maybe he'll have to work as you
breathe well that's one way to do it but

265
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:37,649
we do need to figure out you

266
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,890
people to work together and make sure
they're not gonna completely silent all

267
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:46,530
right and and within our industry we've
heard you know you've heard so many

268
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,460
years of talks about we need to bust out
of our own echo chamber

269
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,850
alright we are a subculture that comes
together with like-minded people who

270
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:02,040
like to break things and Bob Loblaw and
were conveying the same messages over

271
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:08,129
and over to ourselves right I'm this is
not the first time you heard it right so

272
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:13,740
the problems with these strong
subcultures and building walls around

273
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,810
themselves that you end up the outcome
becomes this echo chamber and we're not

274
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,480
really doing anything without making any
progress

275
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:32,790
so the dangers of being too intrenched
in a subculture besides my wife does

276
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,790
anybody have any idea who this guy is

277
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:44,310
ggl thank you one person will buy a
drink after this yet

278
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:55,830
did they yeah we didn't we did not think
we yell and it is a very extreme example

279
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,980
of the punk-rock subculture right right

280
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,880
I'm not going to get into any of the
details you can google it

281
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,600
supergroup it's really gross ah but you
have to kind of way because we're doing

282
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,230
this analysis between information
security subculture and punk rock

283
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:18,030
subculture you have to kind of also
analyze this whole thing you know

284
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,960
there's going to be a subset of our
subculture that are the super geeks that

285
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,720
are super hardcore felt about what they
do

286
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,330
ok and and there are dangers about right
i first started thinking about this that

287
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,870
I'm afraid I'm guilty of it and i was
interviewing people and third expect

288
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,969
like okay well tell me about the first
you know PDF file into maybe that should

289
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,360
be the standard we've got to reach out
to more people than you know just keep

290
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,139
that came up the way I did that
obviously not gonna scale that's kind of

291
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,290
where I started right and certainly a
lot of you like to brag about their

292
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,870
their get going pd

293
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,949
ok let's do you know how I got into it
with this isn't how I learned it that's

294
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,530
how it felt hot right

295
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,420
good thing we got a branch back then
okay look at yeah I mean it's great for

296
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:07,910
me I'm certainly glad the way I got
another industry but for everybody all

297
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,410
right that question we really want to
add the necessary to be obsessed with it

298
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,370
about to be a good degree is it
necessary to be that hardcore about

299
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:22,969
something to be successful at what
you're trying to accomplish with the end

300
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,740
of music genres is arguing over who's
more hardcore now what the actual what

301
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:34,580
actual computer now I don't think like
you know I think right now during this

302
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:42,620
dumb computers version of this talk
we're listening to the bad rings okay so

303
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:48,889
many of the people who are familiar with
fans of that genre that original kind of

304
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:56,480
punk genre will take a look at a green
day and be like that is not punk rock

305
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:04,490
ok but at some point Bad Brains Black
Flag Sex Pistols clash at some point

306
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:10,790
those ideals influenced others that may
not have had that really hardcore

307
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:19,280
subculture focus and that influence got
into the mainstream culture common sense

308
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:27,379
and yeah and if you and if you end up
just hanging on to that just pure

309
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:34,160
hardcore portion of of you know of your
subculture sure you will likely end up

310
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:41,990
with some level of a crazy cult
following like GG Allin did but your

311
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,740
spirit of influence becomes close to
zero

312
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:51,410
it's approaching null diving example
here

313
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,809
mergers and acquisitions are a
particularly interesting case to look at

314
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:01,070
how culture change right we take your
invasion plan together and we're doing

315
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,550
one call to the other are we gonna leave
you stop

316
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,659
it at one culture going to dominate the
other we try and blend them together are

317
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,290
we end up with some type of counter
culture or one side pissed off at the

318
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,610
other one right now in every single
murder that happens they always say oh

319
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,100
we're going to take the best of all
right

320
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,370
and obviously doesn't happen to the
point where am I to go to business

321
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,560
school and learn about merging
accusation the first thing they teach

322
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,750
you is a back majority of them fail
completely to the point where it's aight

323
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,060
the research topic in business school
like lying to people keep doing actually

324
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,030
why do they keep trying it's like they
feel so often what's going on at the

325
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,990
point where the leading theory for why
murders happened in the first place is

326
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:47,450
managerial hubris you must be so wildly
over confident in your own capability to

327
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:54,140
tell ya sure most of them fail i got it
right like that how unusual it is the

328
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,430
one meets so go back go back and read
that

329
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:02,420
oh I love the motivator poster right for
acquisition in case you guys can't read

330
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:02,810
this

331
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,169
yeah that was the text mari the
discovery that you are no longer a big

332
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:11,300
fish in a small pond or even a small
fish in a big pond but a small fish in a

333
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,700
big fish

334
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:22,040
ok so as an example I one kind of close
to home just got fired for fire and i'm

335
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,490
working at Sourcefire for a few years
when Alice there's good and bad to come

336
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:34,670
out with it and take a moment to good uh
it was wildly example with their

337
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:40,400
research team and we take a look at that
arm at the coat coat started that's

338
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,740
wrong with sio team and your smartphone
ability research team they came together

339
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,170
and it's been awhile that the guide love
it

340
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,280
alright guys are writing snort rules and
in doing that kind of research arm it

341
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,760
naturally great for people i know around
the whole team we're still there and

342
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,960
they really enjoy right when the
absolute first thing they did was likely

343
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,160
we've got you two teams right everyone
brt we're going to do they dropped both

344
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:10,820
the name and there's a new organization
out all towel and I think that got to

345
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,120
play a big role we just went over how
much it matter if I literally make up a

346
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,239
team that your green your rep we
actually working together

347
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,350
I think i'm a tremendous amount about
how they were able to immediately start

348
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,340
working together oh we're a new team now
we're towel not the old now we're

349
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,409
working together now I don't think that
the only effect and it was kind of

350
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:37,520
compare with him it was a left then
picks up all built those did not first

351
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,150
together quite tho happens and you're
like I very few people on a field side

352
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:52,220
are actually still there right and I
laughed so he it literally most people I

353
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:57,770
know and work with I don't think if they
give us a shiny new name it would have

354
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:02,270
had any effect on right i really do
think it helped with the researching but

355
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,840
they don't look very similar background
people in researching for coming from

356
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,290
the same place but locate we're going to
your research now where we're going to

357
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,290
find a way to stop a bad guy and get
that out there

358
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,980
so a lot of the same background right a
lot of the same ol a lot less that would

359
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,390
kill a wildly different ways of doing
the court is going to be like oh we're

360
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,570
going to dominate your culture they find
out that we want to bring in the way you

361
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,379
guys are doing right you guys are able
to build the company out of nothing

362
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:36,140
you're selling you know security value
but the way you sell one product to a

363
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,970
customer and the way you try and sell
any product in a bundle is so wildly

364
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,480
different a complete waste of different
ways of going about it the people who

365
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,600
were in the jobs are for different
reasons a totally different background

366
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,040
and I suppose people who were just again
rabbit security people at what people

367
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,490
may be came off their networking and
routers like let me get dirty shot right

368
00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:07,790
so two wildly different processes really
blend well together all a little bit of

369
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:13,250
a little bit so why didn't it work for
the deal right i don't think it just

370
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,530
template hey they needed a new name
right

371
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:19,010
the more we look into and think ok well
have changed well there's way too many

372
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,550
variable and that's ultimately the
problem how are we going to tell you how

373
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,930
to picture culture

374
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:28,010
oh we're not there are so many very
involved we actually come back to this

375
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,590
is insanely complex

376
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:36,490
and i don't mean that and then it
complicated right complexity is a whole

377
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,140
branch of client now I complex system is
a completely different ways of looking

378
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:47,440
at a problem and there's a given that
complexity is sort of fitting that

379
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,820
there's no good definition for but the
basic idea is that I complex it is not

380
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,870
just the sum of it part is actually more
than the sum of its parts because the

381
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:00,250
interaction between the part matter and
when they and interact actually come so

382
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,870
unpredictable

383
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,340
that's really talk to manage right so we
see that with emergency we see that with

384
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,020
the organizations that you organize
themselves in the pattern or change

385
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,740
their strategy based on adaptation
actually come back to the complex

386
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:20,529
systems go back real quick that that
imagery yeah that image right there is

387
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:26,320
you know it is the representation of the
relationships within the e.coli box

388
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,549
right so the simplest ordered a doubt
one of the SIP was organisms that right

389
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:36,580
the researchers are looking at and
that's about how companies we start

390
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,210
breaking apart right now let's take that
do that with all the different

391
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,570
motivations and all the different people
on the teams and who they work with and

392
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,590
we are going up with an insanely complex
system and we're not going to be able to

393
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,199
predict the result was going on
everything we going in a different

394
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,100
direction so we want to be able to treat
it the way we're learning about other

395
00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:02,709
complexes right and so you know when we
talk about obviously within business we

396
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:09,820
all understand conceptually the top down
Vs bottom-up kind of managerial style or

397
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,950
how to run a business right but within
complex system that for lack of a better

398
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:22,059
word intelligent design aspect of it
doesn't pan right you want to enforce

399
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:27,879
natively you want to enforce policy from
a top-down perspective that's just kind

400
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,039
of the nature yeah I've got an idea

401
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:35,080
now i need to push it out here's the new
password policy push it out right but

402
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,750
the reality is that that ends up being
because of those belief systems that

403
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,120
kind of attached to the whole equation

404
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,689
that becomes a culture religion and the
only way to really change cultural

405
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:56,470
issues is from the bottom up and taking
advantage of the subcultures right and

406
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,320
and you know they're there

407
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,730
therein lies one of the biggest problems
with information security in terms of

408
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:09,850
you know us trying to change the
security culture for the most part were

409
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:15,010
trying to force this top-down approach
you can let's take a look at an example

410
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,879
right I'll take your typical security
awareness program we want to tell the

411
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,120
user don't click that link make your
password strong and only thing and a

412
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,010
typical way to set that policy and say
follow the politics that's a top-down

413
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:35,020
approach now why would the user hear
that and think anything other than than

414
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,460
that right what's the different but
we're fundamentally thank ya you got

415
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,960
your way to doing things but I need you
to care more about the right that's the

416
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,470
way any further with anything that isn't
going to see it . awareness program

417
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:55,240
right right and and so let's take a look
at some awareness big success examples

418
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:02,110
right of the of the security awareness
programs that I've seen actually succeed

419
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:10,270
it's really targeting more of a personal
family side of the end-user right here's

420
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,759
how you can protect your children on the
internals here's how you know that the

421
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,929
whole you have to personalize it right
this isn't the top-down kind of you must

422
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:29,470
do this or whatever right this is a no
here's the best practice and this is how

423
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,569
it relates to you and your your family

424
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,629
alright everything so

425
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:42,710
what we really have is this clash of you
know within an organization the top down

426
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:49,909
versus the bottom all and I stole this
slide from the deck that I that I that I

427
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,560
did last year right

428
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,470
if on the one side of the house you have
the manager who is you know hovering

429
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:03,230
over the people that report to him
hovering over their shoulder making sure

430
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:09,920
that they are doing their job even if it
it's a detriment to like your job as X

431
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,609
but even this security awareness
training that is going to be an hour out

432
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:14,660
of your day

433
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:19,609
you know that even like it pushed off
because top-down management like we have

434
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:26,029
we have to have results right and and
you have a job to do the clash of that

435
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:33,170
versus a bottom-up natural kind of
society not society but a subculture

436
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:38,990
write it if you find me out so the slot
right if you are involved meaningfully

437
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:45,259
you know in the design of your work if
you find joy in your work if you have

438
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,600
the passion and ability to speak
honestly about right so collaboration

439
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:59,000
and the whole wisdom of crowds concept
really is much more effective in terms

440
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:06,590
of being able to change at a top and a
bottom up subculture level changing the

441
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:12,770
culture itself and direct parallels
direct parallels with you know the indie

442
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:22,100
rock and punk rock subculture will go
over another example quite a while ago

443
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,750
art already tried to bring in a new
video he had a very strong background in

444
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,560
marketing

445
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,029
I any had tremendous success going to
company and improving them back Lee by

446
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:36,890
implementing individual invented right
to reward people for their hard work and

447
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,980
a career system right here's your career
path here is the promotion you should be

448
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,850
going for let's look map that out for
you to understand you know what rewards

449
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:48,440
down the line right so he had used this
isn't a couple different places in order

450
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,119
to build that organization get people

451
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:53,749
motivated and work it failed miserably
at heart

452
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,460
those guys are building games in such a
collaborative format

453
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,579
they're just sitting around football
with each other they were always working

454
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:04,910
together bouncing ideas off of each
other to the point where they came

455
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,420
around

456
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,559
oh hey this is a great idea we've got a
reward for your whose idea was it a

457
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,309
straw

458
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:14,299
I you don't know we work together and
everything that is a little bit so they

459
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:18,619
start naming you know engineer the model
the rest of the team with Connor example

460
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:23,839
like we did that together upon so this
is textbook business going and make a

461
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,529
company better you know give you get
people the incentives they deserve and

462
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:30,259
it didn't work that he didn't understand
the culture here

463
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:35,450
alright if you don't understand that the
changes you make are and can I think

464
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:39,470
that big enough to just throw the entire
thing off off and unfortunately it's it

465
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:43,609
wasn't even understanding the culture it
was understanding the subculture right

466
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:47,869
yeah that guy worked with marketing and
working visit he never worked with

467
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:52,130
engineers who would you work with each
other in the play he didn't understand

468
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,940
at all he was completely baffled when
they came back frustrated and and

469
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:04,220
frankly start leaving comments so yeah
we come back and saying it complex

470
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,558
systems are too complex to predict what
happened

471
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:12,259
so do we give up oh well no will come
the theory of complex systems it

472
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:16,609
ingrained in a lot of their science now
in physical chemistry and economic the

473
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:23,239
point where we can serve take a look at
what's working now and right so how can

474
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:28,009
we actually then take these complex
systems and improve right and that

475
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:33,410
really then comes back to you know
adaptation here right

476
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:40,098
adaptation theory really kind of comes
down to a subset of variables including

477
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:46,940
variation in systems and then the whole
selection process right trying to do

478
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,609
something and if it doesn't work

479
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:54,890
okay well I'm going to learn from my
mistakes you know and or some type of

480
00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:00,710
mutation doesn't work why law and in
nature that species or that variation of

481
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,620
that species doesn't actually that
flourish in

482
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:11,839
environment right and right so this
again kind of ties back to a bit of talk

483
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:17,450
that I did I think three years ago now
right but what then does make an actual

484
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:22,759
system evolve when we talk about natural
security systems the whole concept is

485
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:30,170
all about right presenting the end but
you know the end contributor of the

486
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,670
organizational organism presenting them
with a challenge that challenge could be

487
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,730
finding food that challenge could be in
a group setting

488
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,640
finding the whereabouts of a sunken
nuclear self if anybody knows the USS

489
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:49,549
scorpion soy alright but the bottom line
though is that in and organizational

490
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:55,790
setting presenting challenges then
starts to instill competition within the

491
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:00,710
individual elements of that organism or
organization it's the same concept right

492
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:07,010
and then that competition once the
individual elements of the organization

493
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:11,150
realize that we're all kind of trying to
accomplish the same goal that

494
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,320
competition leads the cooperation right
and then it's a repeating cycle that

495
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,250
gets bigger and bigger and bigger from a
top-down I'm sorry from the bottom up

496
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,920
right within the organization

497
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,520
this is how adaptation theory can help
organizations really from again the

498
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,500
bottom-up right change the culture
because this at the subculture level

499
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:39,620
were you know working with challenges
were identifying competition and through

500
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,759
that competition were figuring out how
to cooperate with each other and that

501
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,700
how adaptation occurred right and at the
end of the day the simple statement is

502
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:57,319
that adaptation is going to accord when
it occurs it occurs when the end user or

503
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:04,010
variable of the system either moves out
of or gets forced out of their comfort

504
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:10,190
zone and that's a huge huge part of this
whole equation because most

505
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:15,620
organizations today live within its own
comforts of right the stock price is

506
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,210
good our revenues are good

507
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:22,280
blah blah but the next week we just got
have well that's right because you

508
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,600
didn't get out of your comfort zone you
know instill this kind of bottom-up

509
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,069
change when he's not got anything to
talk about evolution evolution doesn't

510
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,440
mean you're going to get better doesn't
mean you always stronger you always

511
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,000
faster i actually means the population
of the whole adapt to its environment

512
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,700
better and that doesn't mean it's good
for everyone

513
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,680
I in fact that this up here the subject
that it could be the purpose of your

514
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,890
life is to only serve as a warning to
others and extinction is actually an

515
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,819
important part of an evolutionary system
what doesn't work is out right

516
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,390
oh it's not the devil exactly make it
better we might actually want to target

517
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,920
the ways that don't work

518
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:10,280
I and help them die pad all the way to
make the population improve right so if

519
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,640
you want to get the system where it's
going to evolve again you need those two

520
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,950
things in variation and you need
selection got that right so we need to

521
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,520
figure out how to do that now we can
look at nature and to come back that

522
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,210
like what you don't mutate a random
necessarily in fact nature tends to vary

523
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:32,660
mutation rate by gender right if you try
it a mutation on a female and something

524
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:37,640
goes horribly wrong then she's not going
to have any baby if you screw up a male

525
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,259
that other fuels probably still going to
have a baby right because of the the

526
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:48,320
inequality in and reproduction that the
key and because of that there tends to

527
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,150
be a whole lot more mutation email and
serial killers

528
00:42:53,780 --> 00:43:00,380
yeah take any given prison it's full of
men right right and and the the problem

529
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:05,330
though years that we if we're trying to
change the security culture we don't

530
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:11,930
have the luxury of waiting thousands and
or millions of years for nature's

531
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:17,120
mutation variations so then potentially
have a positive impact on our business

532
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,130
right so the lesson is ultimately we
need a safe environment where we can

533
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:26,600
experiment right we need that male we
can screw up and no one will know right

534
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,240
we sort of figured need to figure out
when is it okay to expand

535
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,990
and how can we start doing that in order
to start discovering new ways of doing

536
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,060
things better ways of doing things

537
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,480
of course we can learn from previous
experimentation that a huge difference

538
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,140
if you learn about evolution entirely
through biology you always thinking the

539
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,379
terms of jeans and it's wildly different
we talk about evolutionary system is

540
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,369
human being and involved because we can
talk to each other and we can learn from

541
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:54,840
each other right jeans don't just passed
on exactly i can literally tell you the

542
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,420
good idea then we can learn that way
right

543
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:06,450
and speaking of jeans a moment of
silence mr. gene wilder by that

544
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:10,618
extension right we want to know when not
to mutate some problems are eating

545
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,410
that's all you got a physics or
chemistry problem you literally solver

546
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:17,549
act they don't need to you cater
experiment I know it's usual and also

547
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,750
when the cost of failure is significant
you run a nuclear power plant

548
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,150
you're probably not going to start
flipping button that Wild play we should

549
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,440
experiment right that's not a good
option for you so we need again to find

550
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,160
that sort of optional for optimal
mutation way when it's safe to

551
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,540
experiment when it's not and the mommy I
think we can learn from it what calls

552
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,720
don't work which is actually what
lockheed martin call this organization

553
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,049
they like took the engineer's send them
up in a different building they pulled

554
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,350
him out of all the bureaucratic nonsense
that usually to deal with that

555
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:51,330
here here's your own little playground
figure stuff i'll go play and out of

556
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:54,540
that came like the u-2 spy plane and
frankly a lot of other advancements that

557
00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:00,270
lock isn't very profitable to the point
where we can't if you want to take this

558
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:07,500
model can't call it a comfort thoughtful
example Phil going on this organization

559
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,770
is still running they're still doing
research and drone and I thought this

560
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,150
was insane

561
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,930
they're actually working on tiny robot
fighters that will call around inside of

562
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:21,180
airship envelope to find hold and repair
them airships that's a thing so i don't

563
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:25,200
know if it's like some weird fantasy and
they're actually docked on orders

564
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,790
legitimately people are or head back
towards the airship I want to learn more

565
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,970
but yeah this is really what they're
working on it was a headline from a

566
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,629
month ago or so right whose organization
will set up as a way to experiment and

567
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,040
try new things and and and you see the
exact same thing in pump generation

568
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,800
right so Punk when you really going to
look at the roots

569
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:52,050
was a response to the seventies giant
like you know long-winded a big

570
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,980
complicated songs you think of your pink
floyd's your king crimson's and things

571
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:03,360
of that nature even Zeppelin to agree
right and and as from from a subculture

572
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,840
that took a look at that and and and saw
well you know really thought how

573
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:12,840
arrogant all that is and then coming to
say hey you know here's what we're gonna

574
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:18,600
do we're basically going to break this
down in our own experimental environment

575
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,549
we're gonna break this into a very
simple songs we're going to do stuff

576
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:27,120
we're going to create art that you know
is outside of the mainstream and to

577
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,130
basically get our own subculture but
again you still need the isolated

578
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:37,260
fringes for you can't be so it doesn't
isolate the mainstream you still need

579
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:41,700
some of those fringes for the innovation
right and so you have people like this

580
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:49,020
guy on stage and Iran and Iran you know
legendary icon and you know today is

581
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:54,930
this you know amazing world traveler are
but at you know when all of this was

582
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:01,440
going down his whole subculture ideal
was this stuff over here that is

583
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,920
accepted today don't like it I'm going
to do something else

584
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:13,680
alright so let's let's wrap it up and
bring everything back together right arm

585
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,700
what we want to get across more than
anything else that beat them if you

586
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,259
accept our private that the systems were
working in our complex that the way to

587
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:26,460
get them improve and make sure that they
can evolve and to get to that point I

588
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,630
want they don't be afraid to fail that
the culture we want to build a point

589
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,930
where people can try something different
they can try something new in a

590
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:37,109
corporate organization i don't think
people try and maximize success as much

591
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:42,150
as i'll try to minimize failure on a
plane thing we want to get to the point

592
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,770
where we can actually celebrate your
failure right Thomas Edison said I i

593
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:52,380
didn't i didn't fail these experiments i
found 10,000 ways that didn't work and

594
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,100
we should try to do that you know the
same way in fact we're talking earlier I

595
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,328
if you can think of a good

596
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:01,349
way you failed and learn the lesson from
it um let us know or send that

597
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:05,009
information frankly we'd like to put
together a panel for next year's webicon

598
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:09,479
if you want to come off take five
minutes say this is a project we're

599
00:48:09,479 --> 00:48:12,959
doing I screwed up here's what I learned
that be great because in the scientific

600
00:48:12,959 --> 00:48:17,640
community we can only talk about the
trial yeah but we're all in the same

601
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,450
road and if you can leave some warning
signs for the people behind you that

602
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:26,399
just as valuable we should literally
stand up and applaud your failure if

603
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,539
you're willing to share it with all
right so we want to do that conferences

604
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:34,140
you've got away you failed spectacularly
a lesson you learn to let us know if we

605
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,459
can put together a panel will see if it
turns out interesting maybe that'll work

606
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:44,190
out connected but we do want to say that
you know in your organization let people

607
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:49,440
try it up and if it doesn't work out say
that was a great idea where can we go

608
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,009
from here

609
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:58,499
yeah okay so if anybody's unfamiliar
with this book

610
00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:03,598
get familiar with ok that is Russell
wrote a book couple years ago called a

611
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,979
renegade history the United States in it
he talks about our bait and and this

612
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:14,038
quote from him on on the slide is taken
from an interview that he did on the Joe

613
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:21,809
Rogan experience but basically this book
is all about how the fringe subcultures

614
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:32,940
really set the set the course and
steered overarching American culture as

615
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:41,190
a whole right and a great a great little
example here is in 1968 at the time they

616
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:48,599
were very you know very stringent laws
against gay and homosexuals and at the

617
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:55,019
time the Mafia a subculture owned a
majority of these in new york city of

618
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:59,549
Moore majority of these bars & inns and
things of that nature and they were like

619
00:49:59,549 --> 00:50:03,869
you know something i don't really care
about though the rules like prohibition

620
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:07,859
against I don't really care about the
laws you know anybody wants to come in

621
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:09,029
and drink and we

622
00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:13,619
make profit and all that stuff yeah come
on in that led to the stonewall riots

623
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:19,140
rightmost alright it's really kind of a
keystone for you know that the gay

624
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:24,209
rights movement in that I don't you know
on the one side you know and once all

625
00:50:24,209 --> 00:50:28,049
this happen to really like the police
were kind of like breaking and and and

626
00:50:28,049 --> 00:50:31,380
you know get whatever I cannot permit it

627
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,069
they were disrupting these you know
these bars in these speakeasy and all

628
00:50:35,069 --> 00:50:38,549
that stuff and so on one side of the
street you have all the police with

629
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:41,549
batons ready to cross skulls and on the
other side street you have all these

630
00:50:41,549 --> 00:50:47,038
drag queens like doing like full-on like
Rockhead type you know movement and over

631
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:53,429
five days that then you that this but
but after those five days the results of

632
00:50:53,429 --> 00:50:58,319
this really kind of kind of steered
American culture and and viewpoints to

633
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:04,288
the to the extreme fact that like not
not even three years later a book was

634
00:51:04,289 --> 00:51:09,749
published a book was published that the
author had that not happened as well you

635
00:51:09,749 --> 00:51:13,618
know that was a variable of this culture
change but had not happened the author

636
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,409
who wrote this book would have been
imprisoned in that book was the joy of

637
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:21,329
sex and I'm guessing that a lot of you
probably have seen that from your

638
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:27,929
parents because i know i found my
parents copy right but but that book

639
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:34,259
instead of that author going to jail or
prison not even three years after this

640
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:40,619
big shift of American culture and the
gay rights movement that book was on the

641
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:45,569
New York Times top five list for 70 that
70 70 weeks

642
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:52,349
all right through all the old history is
driven by our leaders and you dig in if

643
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:59,729
I know I might have been a pack of
weirdo going to push the lobby so maybe

644
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:04,499
you want to be able to experiment right
expert can't necessarily tell you how to

645
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:07,169
do what you need to do right now you
gotta start somewhere

646
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:11,729
again we don't have a million years to
try things that random involved that way

647
00:52:11,729 --> 00:52:15,868
we got a third so let's start with other
ideas that people have good way to do

648
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:19,919
that so every talk to go to today I'm
you get a look at the great talk

649
00:52:19,919 --> 00:52:23,549
that's how i should be doing it but i
would suggest another way of looking at

650
00:52:23,549 --> 00:52:25,319
it would be okay that's really good talk

651
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:30,329
that's a good place to start experiment
it might work brought but we have to

652
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:31,529
give it a try and find out

653
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:36,029
yeah and also we can learn from other
sub-cultures we talked about punk rock

654
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:40,169
that's rocket background we had all the
data on it right so that's where we

655
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:43,109
started talking about it any subculture
do you gonna be able to pull the same

656
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:47,609
laughing and if you don't know any
people in from tight subculture go to

657
00:52:47,609 --> 00:52:48,779
the after party tonight

658
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:54,479
well I'm we start me now there's gonna
be a whole chance to learn about how you

659
00:52:54,479 --> 00:52:58,948
know these kind of cultures of all
reward innovation right we've got a few

660
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:05,339
more minutes here you know rewarding
innovation and incentive izing change

661
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:10,109
through challenges is really again one
of the most important one of the most

662
00:53:10,109 --> 00:53:14,609
important takeaways here I don't have my
reading glasses on but the quote here

663
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:18,449
i'm not a huge brands and follower but
this is a great quote right innovation

664
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:21,900
happens when people are given the
freedom to ask questions and the

665
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,479
resources and power to find the answers

666
00:53:24,479 --> 00:53:27,749
that's fantastic alright we're on it

667
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:31,828
yeah that'll at all right last slide
alright and so again let's go back to

668
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:35,279
the original definition of culture is
right that culture comes from learned

669
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:39,779
behavior what works in the path we learn
and that team rolls into our culture so

670
00:53:39,779 --> 00:53:43,979
keep that in mind because if you're a
problem solver you are contributing the

671
00:53:43,979 --> 00:53:48,808
culture right whether you like it or not
you're developing solution and people

672
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,979
can learn about the solutions from you
that is where your organization culture

673
00:53:52,979 --> 00:54:00,509
and at the end of the day also this
version of this talk did have a fight

674
00:54:00,509 --> 00:54:02,400
the power playing it was gonna be great

675
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:09,630
really I it wasn't but yeah you look
listen forget you forget the bosses i

676
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:14,609
know that you know that to a degree
that's well fuck it that's punk right

677
00:54:14,609 --> 00:54:20,098
forget the bosses your subculture
solutions contribute to culture right

678
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:26,849
and and that's really where all of this
and when we as a collective subculture

679
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:30,239
here talk about the frustrations of
being able to enact

680
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:36,049
change within an organization this is
how we can do it it's it can't be

681
00:54:36,049 --> 00:54:44,509
top-down it has to be bottom up from a
subculture alright thanks everyone for

682
00:54:44,509 --> 00:54:47,929
coming we should probably update with
the next person God record that you have

683
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:52,130
any question up we let know after that
the talker in the bar later tonight I

684
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:55,759
don't be happy to talk to you guys again
if you want to celebrate your own

685
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:59,420
failures let us know and maybe we can
scrape together not to put together

686
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,249
another pop right thanks
