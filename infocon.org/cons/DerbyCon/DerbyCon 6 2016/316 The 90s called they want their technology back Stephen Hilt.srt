1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
the buttons so hi my name's Steven hilt
and that's and that's fine I don't care

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,960
go ahead and go get whatever you want
when it comes in it'll be in the back to

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,050
just go get some time I think I know
about ninety percent of the room so it's

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,320
fine

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,769
today I'm going to talk about some some
legacy things that are still in use and

6
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,989
titled the nineties called they want
their technology back project started

7
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,660
with a healthcare related research
specifically to just discover potential

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:48,120
leaks of PII we looked at unique aspects
that are really talked about when we

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,370
looked at new hardware to look at new
protocols to reverse and things like

10
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,489
that and it came fairly prevalent that
was gonna cost a lot and I didn't have a

11
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,920
lot of budget at that point in time and
I knew that doctors still carry these

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:13,200
wonderful things around called pagers
and so that's one thing we looked at as

13
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,720
well as other communication paths is
anybody out here been at the doctor's

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,509
office and saw him carrying a pager you
ever wondered why they use them still

15
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,750
and potentially what's being sent on
those for them

16
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:37,380
yeah you have good good good good so we
started digging into that history of the

17
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,130
pages themselves they're launched around
the nineteen fifties specifically in use

18
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:50,009
in hospitals in in New York at that time
it was twelve dollars a month for about

19
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:57,329
25 mile coverage of systems in 1962 Bell
systems presented a radio paging system

20
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:04,408
at the World's Fair in seattle and
officially in 2001 motor all actually

21
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:11,099
stopped making new pagers despite that
there are still multiple

22
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,200
protocols in use still today and we're
going to dive into some of that here in

23
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,630
a little bit i grew up in the mainly as
a kid in the nineties i was born in the

24
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,109
eighties but in the nineties we all
remember that pages were used to be a

25
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,470
stable some bits doubt status symbol of
coolness

26
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,030
I remember when my school actually
banned pagers mostly because drug

27
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:42,730
dealers drug dealers were using them
some of us really wanted to be cool and

28
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,000
you can actually win a free pager
apparently this is probably the best

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,520
image i found and we all know one of the
greatest pager examples ever in pop

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:03:01,870
culture but honestly who uses pagers now
if you remember this movie and the

31
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,650
hangover

32
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,620
he specifically asked if the caesars
palace was pager friendly if you haven't

33
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,550
that's a good chance chuckle we're going
to specifically look into the doctors

34
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,100
using pagers in this talk and then give
a little bit information at the end is

35
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,290
actually ended up being a larger project
that i had planned because of some other

36
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:30,820
information that we had seen during the
analysis phase and watching of these

37
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:37,900
protocols so the protocols are going to
talk about which is pox AG toxic stands

38
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:44,380
for the post office code standardization
advisory group talks AG pagers operate

39
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:54,190
at the 512 1200 2400 baud rates the
standard operates at 512 think i have a

40
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:01,959
1200 a 2400 pager and later I'll show
them and if anyone has an SDR and feels

41
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,830
adventurous and has a hand license to be
able to actually transmit which is what

42
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,150
I'd recommend you do not send page you
can try to see if you can make these

43
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,630
beep

44
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:17,540
disclaimer disclaimer right we're gonna
go in a little bit about the protocol

45
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,739
itself the pox AG actually starts with
oxide particle starts with the preamble

46
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:27,830
this is something that is constantly
looking for is this preamble this is a

47
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:34,130
standardization across the world as we
found out in the research so it is

48
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:45,710
alternating ones and zeros 44 576 bits
then actual batches start with the frame

49
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:52,580
sinkers in synchronization code or FSC
the FSC is reserved word 32-bit string

50
00:04:52,580 --> 00:05:01,430
it always is what you see right there
gotta drink to this

51
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,150
thank you

52
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,890
following the asset following the FSC
there is specifically eight frames of

53
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,570
the pox AG message each frame is
comprised comprised of two code words

54
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,020
separated by a synchronization code word

55
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,760
the secret is and that's just to make
sure everything's on time and everything

56
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,969
was received and how to piece things
back together frames are broadcasted in

57
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:38,390
batches and each batch contains eight
frames mother messages can span multiple

58
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:47,900
batches kind of what the protocol looks
like itself said the preamble the FSC

59
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,859
and then the eight frames with 16 code
words the code words are the actual

60
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,540
message themselves will actually go look
into some messages here in a little bit

61
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,850
kind of some of the examples we've seen
and I'll actually do a live demo and

62
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,450
during the live demo please put your
phones down don't record no pictures

63
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,200
please

64
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,960
flex as the next protocol heavily used
that's actually what will be watching

65
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,849
today's flex flex a high-speed paging
protocol that was developed by motorola

66
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,710
and is designed to operate the same
frequencies as pox AG

67
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:32,320
flex use a lot utilizes time sinks
instead of listening for a preamble they

68
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,420
were designed specifically to extend the
life of the battery of the pager have to

69
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:43,300
change these out really like month you
could go longer with Plex course I'm not

70
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,100
forgetting pages on these so it would be
shorter if you actually got pages um I

71
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,230
did get pages we'll go into that later
because i sent them to myself I had to

72
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:58,210
feel cool when you know I always wanted
a pager so I walked around the house and

73
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,620
you know or actually at that time I was
in the hotel room in another country

74
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:09,340
where it's okay for me not to have a
hanging license and send messages flex

75
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,080
utilize is that said that hundred and
twenty eight frames and a four minute

76
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,440
cycle which makes 15 cycles per hour so
you'll see a lot of messages for the

77
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,920
entire time sprint time span that you're
you're listening

78
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:31,090
most of these are going to be sensitive
nature some are still still the American

79
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,169
tone only pages all right bye guys

80
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:44,890
increase the number of cap codes so what
happened when flex with the design oxide

81
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,849
has a limited number of patents cap
codes just because then the length of

82
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:54,010
the cap codes and what happened when the
maid fucks they just made a longer

83
00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:03,310
variable so you can use have more pagers
for the primary focus of this research

84
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,780
the majority of our pages came from US
Canada and Japan

85
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:19,030
however as you can see here there is
more pages then our go back first

86
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,660
you can see all the white variety and
the u.s. of observed frequencies that we

87
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:33,659
saw the pic pages on canada was limited
to two and Japan had

88
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,139
four different ones and you can see
they're not all in the 900 megahertz

89
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:44,910
range like they're in the US Japan and
we did observe some one or two messages

90
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:52,079
and Germany several in London as well
but the ones in London use the same

91
00:08:52,079 --> 00:09:00,089
protesting frequencies as they didn't us
this kind of map shows kind of where we

92
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,620
tried to observe pages what we did in
this case was work on a globally

93
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,920
dispersed team after a meeting we had we
sent software-defined radios home with

94
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,089
everyone and said hey just see if you
can see things work your way through the

95
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:18,600
waterfall identify with the message
looks like and i'll show you what they

96
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,069
look like here in a little bit and start
telling just tell me if you see them and

97
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:25,860
then what we'll do is we'll work out
something where you can watch it for a

98
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,139
little bit and then tell me the types of
messages that you saying so that

99
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:41,279
includes Philippines Taiwan Japan Spain
France Italy Germany United Kingdom US

100
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:52,170
and canada and Sweden as well myself a
trip I took box AG and flex both can be

101
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,620
sniffed because they stay underneath one
gigahertz range for the most for

102
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,290
everything I've observed so far under
twenty dollars you can get these at

103
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,939
hacks hacks shop

104
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:12,509
amazon and as well hear they're selling
them in the vendor area had hacker

105
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,230
hardware has them I know for sure I
don't know if Jack 5 has them with them

106
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,009
or not go pick one up if you don't have
one

107
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:25,740
yes I'm gonna go through this in the
second yeah it does any software defined

108
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,660
radio does but this one obviously is the
cheapest yard sticks work my specific

109
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,870
setup included a hack RF one

110
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:45,540
thanks Ronnie and a log . I'll that's a
log periodic it's an LP 410 it's the 400

111
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:53,910
megahertz 2 1 gigahertz at this research
antenna that cost more than most the

112
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,790
software-defined radios do I think
that's a fifty-dollar antenna with that

113
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,829
i was able to capture longer messages
from further away get better clarity of

114
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,940
the messages as you'll see when we do
the demo there will be able to some

115
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,350
decoding issues just because the signal
is not very strong in here so it helped

116
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,150
me specifically trying to get good
quality messages that we could observe

117
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,290
and see what the true content of them
possibly work or so we weren't being

118
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:28,740
misled or anything like that this one or
the one before

119
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:41,189
that's a hack RF 10 the antenna it is a
LP 410 and actually i use these on the

120
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:48,630
other antenna as well you can get a
converter to fit that SDR it's another

121
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:55,200
cable costs about five dollars to get
and I can't remember the exact connector

122
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,850
types that you can research it i think
one knows to shut out what types those

123
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:09,270
are so then what you start doing once
you have all the software defined radio

124
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,140
setup and all of this is kind of been
discussed before but I'm going to go

125
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,199
through it so those people in the room
that kind of want to learn how to do

126
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,290
this and look at it it's fun and then
we'll get into some of the more

127
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:24,180
interesting newer stuff that we did in a
little bit so what you're going to look

128
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:32,819
for is specifically that's this this is
a flux message that you're seeing there

129
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:40,800
ng qrx but you can also use us SDR sharp
for those windows users out there you

130
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,099
can do both Windows and Linux

131
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,769
it's not as everyone who's done
software-defined radio as getting had

132
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:56,190
any radio up and running on a max not
the easiest task in the world so it's if

133
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,790
you can do it you can but I've always
had nothing but problems trying to get

134
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,500
it all and it's not worth my time so i
usually just get a linux box set up and

135
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
build it

136
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,589
there's a really handy tool has said
everyone's this is not new stuff

137
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:18,600
this has been discussed before and
there's a lot of examples out there and

138
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,170
so we utilize the examples out there
instead of trying to reinvent the wheel

139
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,790
or anything like that so under that
github page down there at the bottom

140
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:36,599
you'll see that there is a script called
pager RX pie it's getting radio python

141
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,040
script that sniffs specifically only
flex if you're looking for parks AG will

142
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,810
go through that minute

143
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:47,969
you can sniff multiple frequencies at
the same time if you use the 1i have to

144
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,970
go and look for the specific frequencies
then haha

145
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:55,920
hardcode them in another script and then
you can run that script and it'll it'll

146
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,910
correlate and pull them all into the
bottom waterfall and then decode them

147
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:13,620
from there on windows there's a handy
tool called a pw PDW a supports both box

148
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:20,459
AG and flex it's a Easy's the downside
of it was only will only allow you to do

149
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,459
one frequency at the time

150
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,319
that's an example of SD are sharp and a
flex messages as well and then what you

151
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:37,349
do is then you feed it into pwv a
virtual audio cable and you start

152
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,250
decoding messages maybe I see that is it
is fine too blurry

153
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,689
sorry about that the brothers blurred
messages in there because i can't show

154
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,870
personal information it

155
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:59,810
so there's yeah there's names in there
and things like that so what you're

156
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,709
going to see once you start decoding the
messages are a bunch of different types

157
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:09,680
of messages and this is a breakdown of
the data we saw we kind of looked at

158
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,290
some of the metadata around amazing
messages that themselves so you don't

159
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,990
actually store the information or
anything like that and over the span of

160
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:27,920
the project which lasted three months we
saw 18 million 291,000 alphanumeric

161
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,099
pages 8 million five hundred thousand
tone seven million seven hundred numeric

162
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,560
and those are the other types secured an
interesting one and binaries and

163
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,859
interesting that one as well we didn't
really dive into those too much secured

164
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,750
obviously as the encrypted pages so we
tried to we didn't look into those

165
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,400
because i wasn't the purpose of this to
determine the encryption schemes that

166
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,939
they're using if they're weaker strong
why because it's all everything else was

167
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:09,230
still in clear text based off of some of
the observations we had we learned how

168
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,770
pages were being used in healthcare one
would be the nurse workflow management

169
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:22,250
systems this is things that tell nurses
where to go who needs what this also

170
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,290
includes the buttons on the side of your
hospital bed if you push that holes

171
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:34,310
little page automatically to the nurse
asking saying you need assistance the

172
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,180
pharmacy and general communications and
general communications can conclude

173
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:44,300
anything like incoming EMS to the
hospital and what to prepare for

174
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,819
condition-wise what's the patient names
you can get them all set in and other

175
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,959
things like that and even hospital
transfers and patients are transferring

176
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,229
hospitals there will be a message sent
out to

177
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,209
that this met this hot this patients now
being transferred to a different

178
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:08,440
Hospital inside of the nurse Flo were a
nurse and workflow management herself

179
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:15,370
scheduling and and schedule discharge
kind of so schedule a discharge would

180
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:19,629
mean that the the patient is being
discharged and the schedule around their

181
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:26,950
discharge the better it's better for it
helps with and the reasons why they're

182
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,760
doing it is it's better for president
pet better preparation before the

183
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:38,410
patient's arrival it helps with reduced
wait times it improves efficiency in the

184
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,190
mission discharge transfer and
housekeeping by housekeeping you'll see

185
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,310
that just do this will seem a little bit
about this dispatching somebody to clean

186
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:56,320
the room after somebody leaves alright
pizza's here everyone go grab go ahead

187
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,919
and grab a pizza you can just pass them
around and about

188
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:07,660
yeah you can bring them up here it's
fine beers in the backbeats in the front

189
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,710
I i know it's six o'clock and people are
hungry and I appreciate you coming out

190
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,260
for my my talk so just sit over here on
the stage you can come grab a piece to

191
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:42,670
video get my god Lucy no no message it's
just being random one thanks though I

192
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,429
was it was a good try

193
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,480
personalized target information so
hospital workers only receive relevant

194
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,179
messages this helps with the workflow
management so they're not bombarded by

195
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,410
other things

196
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,059
I'm and it also reduce crop reduce costs

197
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:05,620
that's all the benefits of it i'm not
going to say workflow management is a

198
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,689
bad thing it's really good

199
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,929
however some of the information that
we've seen over the workflow management

200
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:17,020
is kind of alarming and scary i'm going
to show two examples these are mock-up

201
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:23,770
pages of what we've seen of a couple of
the vendors and specific one of which is

202
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:33,490
navy care Navy care is a clinical
workflow solution and it's provided by a

203
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:38,410
company called hill-rom and hill rom is
not at fault for any of this

204
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,960
they actually sell an encrypted version
of this system that sends to encrypted

205
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,620
pagers so it'sit's it comes down to a
lot of its budget and what people

206
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:54,760
actually are are doing as you can see
here you'll see that there is a patient

207
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,429
with medical record number the medical
record number is the end of unique

208
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:04,270
identifier that they moved to after your
social security numbers they used to

209
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,120
keep in track those

210
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,929
for those who just came in there's beer
in the back to go with that Pizza just

211
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,930
go get yourself a cup and everything
will go good

212
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:26,020
so this one's a stretcher Allart the
other one we've seen is a cura span for

213
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:32,410
span is a company that also automates
the patient transition process there's a

214
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:39,340
product at something called in quicker
and quicker is used to help as it says

215
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:47,050
in its name check in patients in quicker
a lot of its use for transferring it

216
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,740
actually also sends out the URL so if
you actually have a username and

217
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:57,130
password somehow obtained you can log in
and start changing some of the things

218
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,380
for them

219
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:05,290
another one is from epic system is a
piece of software by epic calm which

220
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:11,050
works on coordinating healthcare
organizations stories up and stores

221
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:17,800
patient electronic records a lot of what
we've observed were email page or

222
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:26,379
gateways bed status and medical orders
with this system that's kind of a

223
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,790
breakdown of the companies that we saw
in the total volume we saw again this is

224
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,928
based off some of the store metadata
once we figured out what we were looking

225
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:39,760
at we could flag and count the numbers
without actually storing all the

226
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:47,980
information when it comes to protected
health information for ph I breakdown at

227
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:55,900
some of the medical things that we saw
where ph i was being distributed again

228
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,730
based off of recognizing names and most
of those are based on english names so

229
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,830
this could be misleading it could be
lower than what the actual number is the

230
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,750
email they were stored within a
forwarded email that is put into a pager

231
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,020
medical term

232
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,100
that's just general medical terms were
included inside of the messages well

233
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:27,389
English names there was no 510,000
specific english names there was sending

234
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:34,710
syndromes and diagnostics medicine on
the actual FDA drug list will go through

235
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:41,460
some of that here in a minute as well i
can show you some of that would be again

236
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:51,840
named male 29 years old being admitted
with the diagnosis of X you sell a lot

237
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,709
of those messages are being seen you
start learning it's kind of scary and

238
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,050
thought like the minute I start seeing
this and I look through it I go when I

239
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:06,840
go to the hospital which i hope i don't
i will i be conscious enough to say

240
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,320
please don't page my information out and
if they what would they do if I told him

241
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:23,129
I didn't want the information out on the
paid pager systems so based off some of

242
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:28,260
the Diagnostics terms we started
flagging some information kind of what

243
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:37,950
we look at fled the EKG sepsis x-ray
ortho kidney know all those terms and

244
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,430
accounts that we saw within the time
span that we were actually looking for

245
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,660
these it's fairly high given that the
number of very genes and things like

246
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,500
that that we're doing short time
listening in just to verify pages

247
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,870
because there were several places across
the country and specific it's not just

248
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:58,889
one region inside the u.s. that we're
looking at when we traveled around we

249
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:05,490
look at things as well and see what we
saw to see if it's a systemic problem or

250
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,940
just a region in which I lived it was
visiting that one time or things like

251
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,480
that and i can tell you based off of
what I saw it may not be every hospital

252
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,210
in every town but high probability in a
major city you're actually going to see

253
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,210
a lot of this information

254
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:35,640
top prescriptions beer all tylenol and
so friend insulin

255
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:44,940
yeah that doesn't strike by a girl come
on guys chase

256
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,950
yo I don't think you get prescribed that
friend in the hospital just going to say

257
00:24:52,950 --> 00:25:04,020
that that's a little too much
information there Ronnie yeah i know i

258
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,730
don't know his nursing homes necessarily
need pagers that like yeah thanks Eric

259
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:17,219
and so this was all seen was it within
departments within the pharmacy pages in

260
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:24,000
specific so we're going to go through a
couple of those pharmacy pages i

261
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,050
actually like this sign is refunding
found that was searching pharmacy signs

262
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:38,550
for the slides so one example would be a
morphine for the emergency department

263
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:44,909
medical record number room number so the
thought on this that we had would be in

264
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:50,160
a potential attack scenario or misuse of
this page in specific is if you are able

265
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:56,370
to send a page and you a medical record
number to a specific room number you

266
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:00,149
could potentially cause some damage and
issues to the person I don't know the

267
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,470
backend processes other than what i've
seen via the airwaves

268
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:12,030
is that what I've seen is that I believe
this is in theory possible that you

269
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,200
would sit in this they would possibly
dispatch medicine to that room and

270
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,220
probably charge him

271
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,720
I don't know about that piece either it
kind of same one with the next one next

272
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,130
to as well

273
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,710
hey Jason there's pizza here if you want
some pizza

274
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,190
cool

275
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:35,460
the next one is as I said in somewhere
in the country i won't say exactly where

276
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,380
it or not in the country in the world
organ donors was the highest thing that

277
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:46,559
we saw so once the morgue had the
cadaver what organs were up for donation

278
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,049
came around

279
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:52,799
so this is donor number at the donor
hospital

280
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,740
this one would be a female age 49 again
this is a mocked message not a copy

281
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,490
message so just kind of put those
numbers in there but it's like what you

282
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:09,899
what we have seen the offer then this is
for patients the donor for the patient

283
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:17,279
and the data burst of the next patient
and we talked about eric mentioned

284
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,610
earlier nursing homes however there is
home help homecare we did see some pages

285
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:29,820
that alluded to a home home care
solution system this one would be

286
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:36,029
Goldschmidt patient name date of birth
and the actual phone number for a

287
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:41,880
pharmacist for medicine at CVS or
Walgreens or anything please call the

288
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:49,320
patient has horrendous cough needs a
steroid not predators out there saying

289
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,320
that this this patient needs different
medicine

290
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:06,770
one of the surprising things that we saw
was the things when people actually die

291
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,360
in hospitals it's a page called def
notify I'll show an example here in a

292
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,240
second i want you to take this in and
and see all the glory of this mean that

293
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:29,510
i found is anybody know where Justin
else's so this is an example of a death

294
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:34,970
at two different notice notices this is
an example of what we saw in which they

295
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:40,910
were actually a manual message went
through about the family for a guy is

296
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:45,650
waiting in the waiting area their name
and phone number and then the death

297
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:52,190
notification as well for another person
that comes through we witness that there

298
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,330
are multiple types of messages notifying
of death

299
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:02,660
oh and also dispatching to send somebody
to speak with the family about somebody

300
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:09,830
who just got anybody have any questions
or anything like this at this point in

301
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:15,169
time I'm gonna go into some pretty crazy
real quick and it's gonna be blurry as

302
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,800
the screen sucks or whatever but having
my image is blurry

303
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:33,139
yeah I can't you can't

304
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:37,370
so the way pagers work their broadcast
based system so once one sent out you

305
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:43,370
can't I can intercept it and make it not
go but what you could do is send one

306
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:50,000
that said something else right after it
or keep upping how much prednisone they

307
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,520
need just keep dispatching it to him or
change it all up our say it's you and

308
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:05,510
you want more morphine because you're in
pain and no one's giving it to you know

309
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,540
it's this

310
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,889
pic to the cap codes and I'll go through
that in a second I should have done it

311
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:16,560
back in the beginning but the cap codes
are a thing that is uniquely identifies

312
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,600
each pager these run on the same
frequency different moderate but if they

313
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,320
even or the same body this these two
pages would never get the same messages

314
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:35,669
unless you send it to each one
separately so outside of the us some of

315
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:40,020
the messages we saw were fairly cryptic
and luckily I was nice enough to put the

316
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:45,510
string whites there are the this would
come through and in a numeric page and

317
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:56,940
it's 40 1049 4069 163 7010 4840 what
that actually translates to as we

318
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,710
figured out vs and some research and a
lot of help from some of the Japanese

319
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:06,120
co-workers who can actually read
Japanese and I can't so that actually

320
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:14,760
translates to english its test alert and
it uses a grid chart so 40 is 40 would

321
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:23,100
be a tea so and 10 e and so on and so
forth and there's actually kanji in

322
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,719
there so if you start looking into and
started kit ecology this is just an

323
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,690
example of test alert sell lots of these
in japan it turns out Japan uses a lot

324
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:39,450
of it for emergency issues for public
notification things like that the

325
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:46,140
broadcast out messages at this point I'm
going to switch over to doing a demo so

326
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:50,880
you can go ahead and stop the the the
recording for just a minute please

327
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:56,670
which is there you see things not in the
region because they're still utilizing

328
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,020
nationwide pager systems nationwide
pager systems again it's a broadcast

329
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,550
based system so it never knows where
that pager is like a cell phone so it

330
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,550
goes to every tower and gets sent out

331
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:14,100
so it's a fully broadcast good pickle
what we're gonna do now is we're going

332
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,699
to talk about actually spoofing the
pages there's again is the to cap codes

333
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,460
at the baud rates and the frequencies
there's a tool out there called gr

334
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,770
mix-a-lot it again

335
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:33,720
links at the bottom I really simple
gonna radio flow there she can see it's

336
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,580
pretty much just a box AG is built into
the new radio so it's fairly easy it's

337
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,899
really easy to go ahead and just send
messages Tupac sag flex a little more

338
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,250
difficult but you can do it but for the
sake of this just kind of showing that

339
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:51,630
we can send pages and this is being the
easiest manner so what we're going to do

340
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:57,960
here is this is my to pagers i'm going
to go ahead and play and watch it so

341
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,250
they're going to shut off my show you
that where I'm sending these pages in

342
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,200
dead space here in one second

343
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,040
so you see there's no messages or
anything like that

344
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,180
nothing around that that those
frequencies which is 931 4875 there was

345
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:21,630
the first message will scroll back walls
swing back over here in one second and

346
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:29,190
show you that that first page Seattle
the pager on the right lit up and then

347
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:34,170
the pay that's the second page different
baud rate as you can tell us a little

348
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:41,670
Wyatt and then it we're going to go
ahead and show show the messages

349
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:53,790
yeah those are my hands my chubby
fingers thanks and it's just that simple

350
00:33:53,790 --> 00:34:00,090
i sent my pagers messages to the page
that could say anything on my original

351
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,780
test said hack the planet grand central
at the planet

352
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,860
yes

353
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:21,630
yeah you can buy used ones on ebay you
can specifically specify the range while

354
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,240
you're looking

355
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,009
forum in which frequency to go based off
of the systems that you have work and

356
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,790
there are companies that are making them
i just know that motor oil isn't these

357
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:37,239
are motorola pagers probably circuit 90
2000-2001 right before they stopped but

358
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,330
there are systems out there are still
making pages and they're utilizing old

359
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,418
pages later man thanks for coming

360
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:51,158
so once i was spoofing pages i also
wanted to show that the same thing

361
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:57,700
applies I can sniff the same pages that
i just sent first example is again what

362
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,220
i said when i sent act upon it

363
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:05,529
I'm so as you can see in this message
here I send grandcentral hack the planet

364
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,910
and you can also see that so that's the
multi mangy that i was talking about

365
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:15,759
earlier and how you can use rtfm pipe
that through multi-monitor ng and you

366
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,980
can decode box AG and flex and then
they're on the bottom is meeting with

367
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:27,730
PDW well showing the exact say I've
first message is the same and then i

368
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,980
sent a spoof and they're on the bottom i
sent a spoof that the doctor FTR I work

369
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,770
for the forward-looking threat research
team at trend micro I we need morphine

370
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:47,560
in room 42 and then FTR rules or all the
message that you actually saw it sent if

371
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,270
it's this easy just a spoof pages and
we're just sending them out now granted

372
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:58,030
we all have ethics and we wouldn't do
this but a criminal would especially if

373
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:03,190
they wanted extra drugs or knew somebody
in the hospital or as we were mentioning

374
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:09,940
earlier you can see things like SMS to
pagers maybe send a message to pay a

375
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,119
doctor and ask them tell them there's an
emergency and they need to leave the

376
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,820
room that they need to go take care of
something or even worse he sent out and

377
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,440
you learn all of the cap codes are in
the region are you being utilized inside

378
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,280
of one hospital and you send an event
like a bomb threat page that they

379
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,280
everyone needs to leave the hospital

380
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:41,450
no because you're on the the receive
only you can go and start figuring out

381
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:47,359
the signal strengths or anything like
that i'm sure you could but I don't have

382
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,810
the equipment to do that you'd have to
talk to the three-letter agency

383
00:36:50,810 --> 00:37:01,609
yes yeah in that case it would have been
at this research had to be 210 with that

384
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:05,869
same log parabolic antenna i also have a
standard antenna for it

385
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,390
yeah but you can do it

386
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:25,670
yeah yep so then you'd be surprised how
much the sum of those sdrs how high they

387
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:37,369
can start transmitting tail again we can
send pages i can send anything I want

388
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:43,430
and we should meet in Grand Central and
hack the planet potential attack

389
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:47,419
scenarios i mentioned a lot of these
already you can declare emergencies

390
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:55,010
intercept calls possibly steal a dead
person's identity as sin pages to the

391
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,000
pharmacy move patients within facilities
say you don't want the next to you

392
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,030
anymore because they smell real bad

393
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:09,710
that's the most of the 91 pretty you can
start playing with the imagination and

394
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:15,140
figuring out potential malicious things
you can do a solution to stop using

395
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:22,730
pagers but if you can't move to the
encrypted pages or in canada for example

396
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:29,390
they don't broadcast the name they only
send out the medical record number so

397
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,799
that there's another layer of obscurity
that you can you need to figure out that

398
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,850
it's not a person's name

399
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:43,049
but even then you can start finding out
things or if you knew your own medical

400
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:46,110
record number or somebody else's medical
row but it makes it a little more

401
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:53,730
complex I'm overtime anyway so anybody
got any questions I'll shoot him out

402
00:38:53,730 --> 00:39:00,840
Martin bosses tattoo any questions i
think we and kind of just went through

403
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:13,260
yet what's up might get my pages those
ones that i sent or not in the US but

404
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:22,890
yes other than the FCC can transcend
contract transmits but they have to be

405
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,450
looking for it

406
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:35,609
no yes I yeah I don't know it depended
on vendors when I looked at him

407
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:40,470
somewhere using AES somewhere just
tripled as some quoted proprietary

408
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:46,470
encryption we didn't really dive too
much into that specific but if you're

409
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,879
interested in it there's that they
usually have their manuals our lease

410
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,790
sales sheets available on the web sites

411
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,790
any other questions

412
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,360
no well thanks looks like we planned out
some pizza had some beer ever always

413
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,600
good
