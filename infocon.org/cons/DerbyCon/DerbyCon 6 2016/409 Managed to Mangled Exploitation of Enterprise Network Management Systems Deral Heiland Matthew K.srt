1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,719
they're going good today so I guess
before we get started I just want to

2
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,580
shout out to all the guys just happened

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,959
outstanding everyone doing the laundry
and all the guys take care of videos

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,630
command

5
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:41,190
wow how many people this is their 61

6
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,770
wow that's good that's good

7
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,260
woman 2 I think we just are you ready to
start over there

8
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,519
yes ready to go so thanks for coming to
our chalk management angle is enterprise

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:10,619
network management systems there are
research later round seven and eight on

10
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,850
independent city slicker so we get
started here I just want to give you a

11
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,789
quick agenda and about with talks about
so we've done some research you have you

12
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,009
for a couple years ago around simple
network management protocol covering

13
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,590
everything from Discovery type of tax
all the way to inject so this is where

14
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,720
we added kind of final stage that
research injection attacks into network

15
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,810
management systems use an SMG so we're
going to start off with Kanekalon over

16
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,430
what network management system

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,110
I hate that I think you guys are sort of
that but often i encountered twice a

18
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,909
network management system they take it

19
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,040
doubletake it not quite sure what we're
talking about some other way to get into

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,740
some of our methods used for target
number

21
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,259
systems are going to get into the attack
deliveries the gene methods we deliver

22
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,149
the tax the network management system
Chinese the best date up and then we're

23
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,930
going to get into the vulnerability
discovery process kinda how we laughed

24
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,590
the whole thing out how to get our
testing at high levels you guys can kind

25
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,819
of go back take that same approach you
want to look at similar products or even

26
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,268
other network management systems mean
are looked at and then we get into

27
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,940
exploit demos far I think the demo
should go good but demos are what demos

28
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,000
are so we have to like their nose when
we have to video demos for some

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
ancillary type of tax that with it and
then we'll have some conclusion kinda

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,980
like some best practice ideas about
moving forward around protecting

31
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,590
yourself killed network management
system

32
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,970
let's start off what is network
management system it is exactly what

33
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,769
it's called it is a application or tool
that you can install your network

34
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,330
typically used for all the large
companies for the purpose of management

35
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,530
our network

36
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,160
there's three key pieces of the network
management system monitoring asset

37
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:12,239
recovery and visualization so the modern
aspect of most network management

38
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,220
systems will take SNMP trap alerts so if
you have an incident or issue on the

39
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,970
device in your network it will send an
alert to your network management system

40
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,250
let you know that there's some kind of
issue price is going down because its

41
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,480
health information about what's going on
your network and also treated

42
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,640
performance information often this is
actually pull through as they also and

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,750
then we get into the asset management of
that device and this is kind of the key

44
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,560
pieces that will utilize their attack
and this ability to automatically

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,329
discover new devices on your network and
then we get into this is typically done

46
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:54,329
using ICMP pins suites on your network
then also SNP data is used to gather

47
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:59,280
more information about the device and
identification of the device

48
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,130
and then we get a visualization of most
of the products we actually looked at

49
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,150
they have a way to visualize your
networks you can actually build your

50
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,640
network and location maps and
communication pass so you can visually

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,849
take a look at what's going on your
network a lot of these devices turn

52
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:22,160
college based on the device being down
issues with their network pass down so

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,520
it gives us a visualization of the
actual network that you actually run so

54
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:36,409
now in turnover Matthews been talking
about targeting network images 0 so want

55
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,990
to be decided to target network
management systems this actually goes

56
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,610
back to when we started a research a
little over two years ago we came

57
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,910
together want to take a look at simple
network management protocol we also want

58
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:53,060
to look at some sort of administrative
software the simple ever all over that

59
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,060
research you know we just started
exploring simple network management

60
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,820
protocol flying outfit getting familiar
with it and that's what we saw some

61
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,500
information disclosure issues on
embedded devices you a bunch of research

62
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,880
out there on the rapids of the body and
check it out if you're interested

63
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,469
there's also the happy parents taught
from last year that was some of the

64
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,580
final round of that research so it's
interesting to take a look at a few have

65
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,830
any interesting information was
wonderful but the reason when we come

66
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,330
back together here is that we want to
use simple network management protocol

67
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,250
as the attack delivery and network
management systems are software that

68
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,530
focus around civil environmental
protocol you've got to gather

69
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:47,239
information and these software products
commonly use our provide web interfaces

70
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,880
so that's also

71
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,420
attack vector that we use are also of
interest two attackers because the

72
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,910
software is commonly deployed in me to
large corporations a large number of

73
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:07,480
assets trying to keep track of and what
we found out while looking at these the

74
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,380
sort of us systemic security issues
throughout so take a step back and you

75
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,909
know consider this impact that network
management systems have on your network

76
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:26,140
they provide an attacker with network on
amounts because these devices the

77
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,030
software are scanning everything from
your end . knows too critical

78
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,520
infrastructure and they're also
monitoring and maintaining collections

79
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,570
of your real-time metrics on those
devices can see that that's a lot of

80
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:47,620
useful information that because these
software products reach out to various

81
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,770
components our network is prudential to
them about many cases you might have

82
00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:01,060
domain credentials on to reach out and
actually query systems and other sorts

83
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,850
of access based on a particular product
the users of these products are

84
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,770
typically administration administrative
level and have an elevated privileges

85
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:17,349
within these things can leverage the
product to get the people log into them

86
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:23,620
have another vector because we have
elevated credentials forest because

87
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,470
these products are monitoring your
network

88
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:32,200
they're putting a lot of noise there are
many of them do report stands on at

89
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,770
least popular board someone actually
expanded to fold and you know specify

90
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,469
which port you on this having you know
on demand and it's also happening at set

91
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,000
intervals so they treat a lot of noise
just in acquiring all this information

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,240
and from a systemic security issue this
really goes beyond the products that we

93
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,710
have closures on we've seen is that
there's sort of a common problem space

94
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,880
and that's this the network management
systems trust the device data right

95
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,340
there's just trusting it's not filtering
it you know in development today it's

96
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,440
pretty common for us to where user
provided data and the risks you know not

97
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,780
filtering that data doesn't seem to
happen in the space least that's what we

98
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:28,859
found and this goes beyond I you know an
attacker putting a malicious device in

99
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,810
the eating at data and your you could
have valid devices on your network where

100
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:40,919
an attacker is manipulated the SNMP on
them to contain so our current research

101
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,990
to date we have a total of ten
vulnerable products nine of which have

102
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,460
been publicly disclosed one is in the
active solar process to come out early

103
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,080
November and across those 10 products
there's a total of twenty-one

104
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,510
vulnerabilities so we have the core of
our research was smt as an attack vector

105
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,790
and then other things that we found

106
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,880
well you know poking around these
products and turn about Darryl is going

107
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:15,780
to talk a little bit more about that the
attack so the attack delivery methods

108
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,620
were mainly going to talk about today
are dealing with SNMP discovery and as

109
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,990
tracks and we're also going to cover so
the other vectors we found over poke

110
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,330
around these devices so the commercial
we're going to talk about is SNMP traps

111
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,850
in this particular case device as i
mentioned earlier has an issue on the

112
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,280
network can actually send an alert alert
is gathered by the network management

113
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,880
system received by the network
management system this particular SNMP

114
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,430
trap message is a test message type for
for those are into the SNMP protocol

115
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:58,319
this goes over UDP port 162 and of
course it comes down to the actual trap

116
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,100
not all trap IDs

117
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,780
contain message data example would be a
critical alert on your network if a

118
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:11,240
critical alert is being generated by the
device it's in a unstable state so

119
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,340
unstable state messages would normally
not contain any message data but when

120
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,830
you get into the mornings and words of
other types informational one's number

121
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:27,380
of these actual track messages contain
actual data in this actual data messages

122
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,250
that we're looking at is the instructor
is the attack methods that were using to

123
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:39,800
checked in this is done using a standard
S&P track Lenny's command download the

124
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,560
software make this available so kind of
breakdown this particular trap message

125
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,000
and how we generate I was generated and
this case you ever used to try message

126
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,200
version1 there's also a version 2 is
very similar

127
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,890
the syntax is a little different but
conceptually it still functions the same

128
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,530
way behind the community string now some
of the attacks vary between different

129
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,010
devices we had some devices where you
have to actually know the community

130
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,610
strength and we had some devices where
you didn't even know the actual

131
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,110
community string so we accept all trap
message is actually since those devices

132
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,800
we had several that actually had that
vulnerability meaning that we get

133
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,120
actually not know anything about
environment but if we had a foothold on

134
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,910
your network just an SNMP trap message
potentially attacking your apartment and

135
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,750
this breaks down this is a natural part
you're targeting this will want to have

136
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:38,330
people for 162 oven-ready track messages
and then we have no ID

137
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:43,580
these are these two runs here to be
anything absolutely anything you want

138
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,440
them to be it doesn't really matter

139
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,930
one thing you cannot be that you signed
with if you have to use an enterprise rd

140
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:57,380
that is a valid though ID of the device
on your network and you have the mid

141
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:04,670
tables in there then you have to match
up the actual of generic type ID and the

142
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,349
specific type ID you don't then it's not
a match to the environment so to carry

143
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,100
out

144
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,670
attack we just use any arbitrary make it
up if you want to go ID we actually set

145
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:22,759
the genetic trapped six which is for
enterprise specific and we use ID number

146
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:29,720
99 which is a generic trap ID and then
has the ability to contain string

147
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,089
message an example here actually shown
an hour blocks common alert box so it

148
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,529
makes it simple you actually send this
off to the device and then in the

149
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,759
devices console it's all these devices
that we've encountered all have web

150
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:49,069
management consoles have the ability to
play that particular trap message we can

151
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:52,250
inject these cross-site scripting into
these devices and carry out various

152
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,940
attacks from you know standard
cross-site scripting cross-site request

153
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:06,110
for trees and even actually forming
packs into actual device so i'm gonna go

154
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,550
ahead and turn this over to Matthew he's
going to talk about the discovery that

155
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:16,279
the movies so your call earlier when
Tara was talking about what network

156
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,180
management systems do one of those sort
of the discovery process rights gonna

157
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,829
find what devices on your network and
part of that you know it's gonna detect

158
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:29,508
the presence of the device in the king
suite or the general port scan but if it

159
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,810
finds each port 161 open and it's going
to go a little bit further

160
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,310
he's going to assume that that's an SNMP
agent and it's going to try to query

161
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,768
that device for the system objects finds
any other system objects is gonna retain

162
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:48,139
them and the reason is here is an
example on the screen of four common

163
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:53,420
system objects that are typically
supported real find said on a given

164
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,759
device and the reason these are
important both from a tax standpoint and

165
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:05,630
you can please describe the device right
so a user is going for you never had is

166
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,439
going to want these values in their
network management system because they

167
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:13,610
want to know the description of the
device and maybe this is just a

168
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,060
high-level description of what it is me
to software version of firmware revision

169
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,800
the contact information for you set it
up the name of the device you know where

170
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,520
it's located

171
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,530
so these are going to be cold during
that operation and retained and then

172
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:34,410
displayed within our management system
and take a quick look at how we could do

173
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:41,189
a simple attack against these we set up
our own agent we're going to use the

174
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,900
net-snmp package

175
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,569
snmpd this provides a simple agent you
configure that script the configuration

176
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,120
file for it you'll set the agent address
and write this is just a simple example

177
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:02,310
this is going to allow it to listen on
all interfaces both ye four and six on

178
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,520
port 161 and then later in the config
file we're gonna have two entries for

179
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,880
the system description of the system
named this is just where you have the

180
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,280
text value that is the system object
name followed by whatever you want your

181
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,089
agent to return in this case just a
simple example of returning a script

182
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:26,220
alert over to restart that service and
then we're going to run an SNMP law

183
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,600
against the agent to make sure that it
returns the value of said so that we're

184
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,550
ready to then move this attack you know
agent into the network and network

185
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:42,540
management system beyond the smt base
vectors this is very sort of explore a

186
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,949
little bit and see what else was out
there and then one product that i found

187
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,790
actually had a command injection and
this is where i was able to provide at

188
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,079
the end of the prove it was provided in
HD in this case but I provided that

189
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,090
command and then webservice hosting the
network management system execute that

190
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:07,500
command darrell has a few more talk
about the during research likely said he

191
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:13,260
also closed around for the S&P tax and
looked at other possible things

192
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,600
this was generally just low-hanging
fruit didn't hardly any effort so easy

193
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,480
to find ball boys we asked about
seasonal injection into the network

194
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,199
management products we actually tested
both of those cases yet to be a

195
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:30,849
dedicated dedicated any kind of control
level and we give you the ability to

196
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,760
standard single injection attacks based
on the back in sequel server you can do

197
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,189
everything from you know the rating
files execute code to actually dumped

198
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:48,130
the entire databases on the system we
also found course browsing for browsing

199
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,160
we're actually gonna have a video
example of something data that was

200
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,439
leaked out of network management system
via course browsing attack failed to

201
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,870
mention earlier that both the SNMP trap
and the SMG discovery method we have

202
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,220
live demos showing those and showing us
actually following through with an

203
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,209
exploit type thing with cross-site
scripting actually show taking over the

204
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,799
systems in the directory traversal found
another couple systems that allow

205
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,199
directory reversals these were both on
the windows 2008 service that was

206
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,730
testing basically giving access to the
entire file system on the windows device

207
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,100
last one was kinda interesting this
formats during one turned out to be

208
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,540
delivered through smpp discovery so it
was actually a for mastering attack into

209
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,030
the device via the SNP discovery method
so how many people here to know what a

210
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,649
format string vulnerability is ok so I
see the rest of you don't know what for

211
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,450
mastering volatility is so yeah I guess
I have a minute to actually try to

212
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:57,010
describe this nose so a format string on
the format string is is what is an ansi

213
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:03,280
c specifier so basically what it tells
you is what the output of a function

214
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,870
should be so as an example you wrote a
program the program ask you what your

215
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,949
name was that you put your name my
name's Daryl and it would say back

216
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:18,460
good morning darrell fairly simple so if
the code was written in properly they

217
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,360
didn't specified or mastering specifier
and normally would be

218
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,140
guess which would be a string output if
that was completely left out of the code

219
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,220
and I had that code in front of me and
asked me what my name was and i said my

220
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,649
sterile it would respond back with good
morning darrell fallibility comes in the

221
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,879
places when I put instead of putting my
name i click format string specifiers in

222
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,000
there as example i put a percent a star
% x in there percent in some of the most

223
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,230
common for mr. specified using % x which
is hex tells the operation TX decades if

224
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:00,360
I put a bunch of 1% axes in there
instead of a properly written program we

225
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,699
come back and say goodmorning % % and
then properly written program with for

226
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,620
ministry as far as not defined in the
function at all it will respond where

227
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,899
the data from the process stack it would
actually read data off the process stack

228
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:20,699
and the way that attack works it is you
can actually put dat on the stacks we

229
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,309
date off the stack and use percent which
read that of the input on the stack

230
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:31,080
pointer memory give you the ability to
read harder to remember percent in will

231
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,889
give you the ability to write our trip
memory so you can see how full-function

232
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,080
excellent we carried out i was hoping to
actually do that on this i wasn't able

233
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,270
to get a full-function exploit on this
particular case i was able to read

234
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:52,020
arbitrary memory I was also able to to
read the stack data but I had some

235
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,158
issues and kept running into me course
you ran out of time so i wasn't able to

236
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:03,779
get ahold of those are some of the
examples of the issues associated to the

237
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:10,440
vulnerability discovery process so how
we set up our particular laps in this

238
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,840
case we use virtualized environment in
my lap both this did this typical bunch

239
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,020
a system on VirtualBox worked out fine

240
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,779
we set up linux windows server 2008 when
the server 2012 based on the product we

241
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,120
were actually testing and that's what we
have

242
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,268
laughs are you

243
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:34,779
where we got the software took advantage
of a 30-day three trials most vendors

244
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:40,719
allows to do that we turn around setup
default install that means we just said

245
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:46,959
yes yes standard installed by worry
about no indications security things

246
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:51,549
like that . looking at how these devices
handle is appreciated that was the focus

247
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:56,619
of the entire research so once we set
these up to go through learning the

248
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:01,269
basic functions of the acts this is
horrible oh my gosh is it was horrible

249
00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:06,909
so most of the applications that we
found vulnerabilities in most of the

250
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:11,049
setup fairly easy but there was a number
of these applications it wasn't like yes

251
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:17,799
yes yes yes it works it was yes yes yes
yes that work in 34 days to redeem

252
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:23,259
angles and making changes so so some of
this was fairly difficult work but then

253
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:24,519
once we got everything up

254
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:30,639
test the various SNP injections we set
up a device and discovered what to do

255
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:36,668
with the SNMP data we also went through
the objections of the trap message

256
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:37,599
injections

257
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,849
how does this thing except traffic
traffic will take any arbitrary track

258
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:47,019
message doesn't matter where it came
from or doesn't restrict it down to you

259
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:51,429
know the community string devices setups
lead through all that functionality and

260
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,279
we care about testing these
vulnerabilities stepping through every

261
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:59,649
one of these products and Matthew
pointed out earlier that we had found 10

262
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:04,928
separate network management systems
where SNMP traps smtp discovery attacks

263
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:10,419
work on these devices we only tested
about 20 different products so that's

264
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:14,859
telling us fifty percent of the products
out there all and I should you we did

265
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:19,689
not test all the products out there you
know there's a there's a number and some

266
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,599
of the products didn't have 30 day trial
had so many salespeople so we weren't

267
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,158
about to do that so since we were going
to buy the product i figured that was

268
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:30,960
totally on that

269
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,260
going to go through some silly process
like that so we only test the ones we

270
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:40,980
need to download this run and then after
that and come down to the ethical

271
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,760
disclosure process once we found the
vulnerabilities we need to do a

272
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,770
technical disclosure in this case here
we contacted all probably a product

273
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,960
vendors me the email will be a phone we
didn't actually do this was done by Todd

274
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,559
seriously at rapid7 so shot off Todd
works his ass off does a great job

275
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:07,289
I really helped out of this process and
then after 15 days

276
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:13,320
contact serves let them know and then 60
days after the initial alerting of the

277
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,090
vendor publish it and we all driving
sevens disclosure process and wrapped

278
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:25,470
handle all the disclosure processes for
us that's kinda how that word so running

279
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,210
good time so let's go ahead and actually
start doing some real demos for exploits

280
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:50,850
we have for demos to live ones into
video once so i'm going to demonstrate

281
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,559
an SNT discovery-based attack in my core
products

282
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:11,830
so this is just a home screen for fiber
product families and let's take a quick

283
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:21,100
look at settings here to attack i wrote
up an attack that creates an account for

284
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,209
you either on the system so we're going
to check just to see what users

285
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:31,510
currently exist in the system
improvements actually working so you see

286
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:40,210
here there's only one user and yea
general to setup and if you call back

287
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:53,980
earlier in the presentation talked about
setting up a simple snd 250 spat first

288
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:59,200
let's take a quick look at the web
server directory on your taxes done an

289
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,770
attack that I'm gonna actually in Jets
we're going to skip over a lot of it was

290
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:12,070
actually written car right back from
Caroline on it will see here it's going

291
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:20,168
to assign first name of this user to did
Dave and Penny the last time we decided

292
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:21,380
to him

293
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:43,790
admin role in this short out back now
this is the best energy configuration I

294
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,490
want to make sure to thank you want to
make sure that it's something on the

295
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:54,170
right therapist down here said this is
the attackers ip3 listen on that tacky

296
00:25:54,170 --> 00:26:03,590
at one and this particular attack
actually leverage system named popular

297
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:10,189
see you have a few the system objects
design just general values but system

298
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:17,450
name is actually a script tags and
that's reaching back to attack post

299
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:24,920
grabbing that JavaScript polish put out
there we want to make sure that the

300
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:30,590
Madison p is that we started taking this
configuration and rear ended quickly run

301
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:47,240
service starts at its ok were running so
fast i'm going to go back in i had to

302
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,220
take a look at the network scan option
of this layer network management system

303
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,110
storage here it only is assigned an IP
and I did that just because you're

304
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,580
making them run sugar but normally you
know fully deployed governmental system

305
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:07,100
this was an IT lock range or x block
ranges and these can be scanned on

306
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,230
demand by the admin or baseline
configuration software actually thats

307
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:18,500
can periodically in this case I'm just
going to do it on the man's hand and

308
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,420
scan now this is the scans happening so
it's reaching out of train decided that

309
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,600
IP is active

310
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:32,370
possibly for standard looking at 161
find more one sees you for 161 when it's

311
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:38,280
going to reach out and request those
system objects from is initiation

312
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:47,639
yep you see the divisive an inventory i
do not click on anything all that

313
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,400
happens and you can see thing you know
it's our happened either we're gonna go

314
00:27:53,400 --> 00:28:09,870
back to the settings and look at the
user accounts now except proud about

315
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:33,000
video

316
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:30,230
don't worry I both believe you angry
cause my boss whatever dimension where

317
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:45,020
you actually been demo'd number of times
about issue of course was blood all but

318
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,920
became very there's a video speed it up

319
00:29:48,920 --> 00:30:05,840
yeah i'm just gonna kind of accelerated
to the end we go here's the number can

320
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:23,030
be just the price of years back to the
user house and that's what we actually

321
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,660
have to move

322
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:48,080
is this case we should have to that
place like so i asked a question of them

323
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:56,330
is quite a bit is it and what point does
the JavaScript get run is it viewing it

324
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:01,789
in the webpage sure is a appointed an
amount so when the scan happens in

325
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:07,340
return if you notice like the little box
that up here add some text values

326
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,519
it's actually displaying some of the
system objects like the system name so

327
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,059
the system described the device in it so
the interface is going to display that

328
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:20,210
it's that injecting script so check that
box and execute ok thanks

329
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,379
this video word this word right so in
this case we're actually going to do a

330
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:30,498
trap objection against the product so
i'm going to go ahead and do this with a

331
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:33,529
really complex your password

332
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:44,090
yeah all the vendors everything has been
patched to bed pad talking about here

333
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:51,709
with me won't hurt you guys may actually
10 days so in this century we can see

334
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,629
that we have a standard kind of
dashboard console here in this case here

335
00:31:56,629 --> 00:32:00,289
the dashboard fully configurable can be
configured to actually display the

336
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:05,359
tracks i've not done that in this case
here so the trap message is typically

337
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:11,178
fall under the long as P so we come down
here all the track message was so appear

338
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:15,499
the list them you can actually see the
details at this point we don't see a

339
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:22,820
trap messages and it says I'm like
really lazy writing long strings we have

340
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:33,678
bases here fire this up real quick and
see in this best cheers and similar 1i

341
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,669
showed you earlier so it's SNMP SNMP
trap version1 public in this case here

342
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:42,260
we're actually going

343
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:47,540
do is pick a category called PHP we're
going to do is we're going to steal the

344
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:56,990
session token' takeover console using
the local IP you use well yours was it

345
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:04,670
out outside the internet sometimes I
mean yeah get the devices received

346
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:12,440
attracts over the internet is like
really bad i see more

347
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,780
I've seen worse and it's probably not
unusual I've seen as opposed to that and

348
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,399
SMB track receivers expose the internet
the terminal one of your attack vector

349
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,230
is you can potentially carried out let's
go ahead and run this so we run this we

350
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:33,170
just a trap message over to this
particular product here and we'll see if

351
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,890
it actually receiving yes so it did so
we look at the details very

352
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:41,420
straightforward fairly simple nothing
unusual here you see that some kind of

353
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,390
tried message congratulating you can see
there's actually no message there

354
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:50,750
another way i like to point out is that
Enterprise yd this one right here so or

355
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:56,270
about three dots it's not one that for
that 1435 if you actually see this on

356
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,430
the network you got bigger problems

357
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:06,380
this is actually registered on that
Enterprise a lot so so he's actually see

358
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:11,659
prices shown up on your network with
that enterprise-d yeah i would probably

359
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:17,990
something you probably don't want that
device in network so we would have did

360
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:25,250
this let's see if we can see if this is
actually a workforce so there we go we

361
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,840
captured the actual session cookies from
this device interesting angle this

362
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,429
attack . this thing like actually
totally cute with you notice session

363
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:41,510
tokens actually have a quotes in it and
quotes are literally not standard or

364
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:47,389
accepted within cookies so all my code
monkey have actual

365
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:53,269
up quote mark so that's why this command
up here at the pad use this new image

366
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:58,129
source with the standard source working
trunking and that's why it up using

367
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:06,230
using that let's go ahead and see if we
get actually carry out this tag actually

368
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:10,730
work so proud here of course I would
walk in

369
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:24,919
let's go ahead and walk out ok sorry
clean up the last pay attention of the

370
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:36,049
go-ahead for refresh this

371
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:43,849
go ahead with the cookie because of the
signs cookie but its dedicated cookie on

372
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:56,420
the picture heart you got there was like

373
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:40,069
those who see my advisories going out
probably probably familiar with this one

374
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:47,299
so we're going to send a school

375
00:36:50,989 --> 00:37:07,249
go ahead and send a special one here and
check details customers want this one of

376
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:18,529
their site so let's go ahead and we have
a couple of videos were actually new

377
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:25,549
terms of Matthew to show his
communication is it was a product called

378
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:30,140
pantech that had a really old version of
the newer version that i found the

379
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:36,618
manufacturer elections the existing both
the older version with little bit more

380
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:42,589
interesting because it didn't require
any effort vacation is authentication

381
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:49,729
with disabled by default the diversion
they had a whole user model products and

382
00:37:49,729 --> 00:37:55,279
the other thing was that this through
the finger tool within the products

383
00:37:55,279 --> 00:38:00,950
which was able Pro users in the old
version and then you're ready 5 version

384
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:08,509
used to kinda added so in this case it
will be demonstrated the system would

385
00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:13,660
have to be configured finger tool but he
is

386
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,549
you're logging has very low level in
this case they call it a little for

387
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:26,470
product that's simply guest religious
tassels here this year in this guest

388
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,980
privileges really don't give them much
access to any better back the interface

389
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:40,690
is he told it all back a number of
dashboard values but we know the yeah

390
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:46,839
URL for the bigger cool so we're going
to paste that environment and basically

391
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:52,630
note that you're asking this little
finger is where the injection occurs you

392
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:58,210
just simply escape at the end of command
and then color to run this case what I'm

393
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:06,579
going to do is have users bad follows
actually the dismemberment running over

394
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:13,150
that passion and we have user account
and password hashes that's something you

395
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:18,970
crack about really goes beyond this
demonstration I can run any command and

396
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,078
that will run under the user context
that's running the network management

397
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:32,230
system that was a real heroes route that
don't worry about those are going to

398
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,230
turn back darling

399
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:52,850
this particular one in this particular
god we were talking about horse browsing

400
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:58,310
attacks and really common vulnerability
common websites converse size various

401
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,759
sites on the internet in this case we're
looking at you know off-the-shelf

402
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,420
software your network management system
they suffer from all the same problems I

403
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:10,940
think we made a community art in this
case here we look at some of the

404
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:17,240
interesting data that can actually take
this happen to be walking to manage

405
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:26,270
engine brought our product this case
here here there is a number of number of

406
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:32,360
files that you can access the only one
sec so we get in this case you actually

407
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,380
see all the counselor configure the
system where do we get the password just

408
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,720
really disappointed but we're going to
get a lot of information domain all the

409
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:47,990
information good attack data easy to
avoid arousing attack look at is

410
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:53,750
actually better not as good as password
but its second best deal with network

411
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,910
infrastructure price we see here we have
these God's never assume there's nothing

412
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:06,350
behind those often there is in this case
here we go ahead and behind the actual

413
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:17,299
source of this age we scroll down

414
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:21,050
why

415
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:29,150
literally for processing attack were
able to gain access to basically all of

416
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:34,309
these bottles shown here are all part of
the Federation function of the device

417
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:39,650
this is the problem i see across the
number of products whether it's an

418
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,760
off-the-shelf product that has a
westerner was an embedded device whether

419
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,430
it happens to be the standard coppers
type you know web in science these laws

420
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:55,460
and extensions often don't get picked up
by the systems built in communication

421
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:03,530
mechanisms that happens in the case here
is always sees access we see I manager

422
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:09,260
IPS your age the I Martin bored out of
you

423
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,900
these are all key configuration data
structures of this product and we gain

424
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,430
access to all that data on this would be
perfect for on pentest numerate

425
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,410
something like this

426
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,009
gather all this information you have
immunity straight to keep these trees

427
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,109
all your targets on your network

428
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:32,598
typically the community string
configured on this device more likely

429
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,930
will be configured on other critical
infrastructure devices

430
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:40,250
this is network management system is
probably going to be that way and

431
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,740
through this bath you carry out these
attacks very very useful information

432
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:52,160
they leave those config files just in
the root of the net web server was that

433
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,420
they leave those config files just in
the root of that web server yet

434
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:06,980
oh my god Wow was there fixed on stupid
working relationship you know things

435
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:13,099
like lapped up like 20 products tenable
did we did I go back and validate all of

436
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:15,690
their cross cover every possible one and
the answers

437
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:19,470
did I checked some of you know some of
that some of the vendors will come back

438
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:24,419
and go hey can you validate this course
before we go out here is the code i

439
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:29,040
often encounter vendors do that when
they do that interact with like that

440
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,700
i'll go through revalidate other than
that I'm gonna trust them as

441
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:39,509
professionals to go through and fix the
problem and if they don't we know what

442
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,560
the consequences it somebody's going to
come behind me is gonna be twice as

443
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,819
embarrassing

444
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:55,950
cool ok so move their cabin conclusions
were closing down into this so we want

445
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,640
to talk about so risk factors mitigation
techniques and we got kind of three

446
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,598
things to think about as we're
approaching this type of the first one

447
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,700
implement patch management program work
of all these fingers they supposedly

448
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:15,089
patch all of their products now us as IT
security professionals

449
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:20,040
we're not always the best head patch
management got really good operator uses

450
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:27,810
that right so we're not good at patch
management of applications and code and

451
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:32,250
things on our network think purchase
better secondary or our network not the

452
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,270
primary operating system so we need to
put together a good patch management and

453
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:40,200
consider all these programs consider all
the programs that are in your network

454
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,689
operates in your soft that is an
attacker to gain a foothold in those

455
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:51,150
means game over at that point there so
it's important as we report these

456
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,079
vulnerabilities that we implement a
solid patch management program to get

457
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,450
those issues fixed

458
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,140
yeah I mean we also really need to
consider the risk of machine-to-machine

459
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:07,940
communication I think today you know
everyone's really good about it

460
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:13,730
provided data or validating and we're
filtering it but I think machine treated

461
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:19,910
information is largely been ignored at
least in this space and you know that's

462
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,420
from your development side but also
consider that from deploying software

463
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:33,380
you know data permission and what the
risk is poured up together one last one

464
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,380
hardball is a monitor your network

465
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:43,940
I mean head it's simple to look at you
know if I'm doing fantastic attacker is

466
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:49,580
on your network and targets your network
management system as as an actual

467
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,230
example and gave the photo like we
showed how really easy it is at that

468
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:58,280
point we can actually use those devices
carryout pivot attacks with your network

469
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:04,940
use them to run around scans on your
network that should be abnormal behavior

470
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,990
you should know what your devices do it
you should go win it run scan what it

471
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:14,930
pro when it pros how it does that and
create footprint of this behavior and

472
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:20,060
put together implement some method start
with devices and these type of

473
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:25,250
applications because i use this attack
will not be specific attacks but attacks

474
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:30,920
of these types of systems i gain access
to critical security management products

475
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,390
on corporate networks before and then
use the that particular product that

476
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,319
particular machine and those particular
rights of that machine carry out attacks

477
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,830
throughout the entire environment have
the have the security operations center

478
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:47,120
totally ignore because oh that's that's
normal behavior that's what that device

479
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,970
does but the thing is you know that
device does that stuff saturday night to

480
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:57,140
$TIME in the morning it should be doing
it on you know sunday morning you know

481
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,460
in the middle of the week those are
behavioral changes that should be

482
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:08,060
monitoring your actual environment so
moving from that got the inclusion of

483
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:16,130
here some weights these links go off
these advisories we also released a 4-1

484
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:21,800
covers every bit of this on rapid seven
sites so it covers all the products

485
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,650
whole methodology the attack method is
how we set up our lab how we set up

486
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:32,930
device in detail so you literally take
that white paper reproduce all the

487
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:41,810
research to do it and uh 45 so any
questions actually have two on one

488
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:46,310
single day so I tweeted this morning
asking what network management system

489
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:50,060
you use we looked at a bunch of software
that's just what we found you know based

490
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,630
on articles are cooking out i'm sure
it's like what people actually use you

491
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,470
guys showed up to the top so obviously
interested i'm curious what you guys are

492
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,620
using so you know reply to your
something to let us know what you're

493
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:04,910
using also also shoots out a tweet if
you like this presentation like this

494
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:10,009
research often we do these things don't
get no and all the way we get a

495
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:14,060
handshake you know like your
presentation often like to have a little

496
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:18,620
more interaction you know so choose
between us you liked it

497
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:29,660
we really appreciate that this long as
you wanted all of this research here was

498
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:36,620
against 12 but I mean Angela the general
fact is the only difference between one

499
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:42,170
to three security so it literally if I
gain any kind of information on your

500
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,980
security and I compromise that the
authentication methods

501
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,210
three which are is possible anything's
possible

502
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:54,200
at that point all these attacks would
still work is the same underlying

503
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,339
functionality of S&E is the same across
all three products

504
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:02,720
the only difference was three is
basically the security model

505
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,319
yeah you have to create those you have
securely it's still going to display the

506
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:12,230
values but it does this project will be
displaying the traps maybe a little more

507
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:16,970
difficult but the discovery attack would
not change it was still working his the

508
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:23,870
three specials we all learned something
on your network that was one of the

509
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:28,940
things that you pointed out not all
these products you could actually change

510
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,590
the device or existing on the network
but there are a number of products out

511
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:38,240
there that my compromise some
low-hanging embedded camera on your

512
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,490
network that is SMP table and you as
part of your constant discovery and I

513
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:48,709
change the information about this name
is this description says location is

514
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:52,970
going to consume that data and change in
your network management system making

515
00:49:52,970 --> 00:50:00,259
this attack file there also any other
questions real quick before we close

516
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,240
down

517
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,240
well thank you very much for coming

518
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:13,930
yeah
