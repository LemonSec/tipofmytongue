1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
even under slide what you're doing my
students murmuring slides to make our

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,510
professional more mark our profession
more professional i gave this talk about

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,070
two years ago

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:18,420
b-sides asheville and it kinda had some
strong reactions and my idea here is to

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,970
make you think if I don't convince you

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,689
that's fine and I I can be wrong

7
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,230
I mean look at my first wife so
everything I say here is not the express

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,610
opinions of marshall university and they
may not be mine after the stocks over

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,960
network Scouts a project that we did an
undergraduate concept came up with the

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,559
idea

11
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,050
me and Justin Brown who was working up
the hackers for charity booth and we had

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,519
two students who actually worked on it
so get it on get up check it out

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,620
network scout and we have the device
upstairs in our booth marshall

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,019
university is a sponsor this year

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,659
listen my podcast and then I'll have six
people listening to podcast rebooted

16
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,220
bypass com

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,530
we've had some interesting gas over the
last year and a half or so we've talked

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,500
to Sabu we've talked to weave and we've
actually had students on his guests but

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,390
we do it for fun

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,650
so the hacker ethic the hacker ethic is
all information must be free mistrust of

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,350
authority hacker should be judged by
their hacking not focus criteria such as

22
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:42,419
degrees you can create our computing on
a computer which is true and computers

23
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,590
can definitely change life for the
better the one that we probably need to

24
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,030
look at here specifically is that bogus
degrees

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,540
you know most people came a hacker
because they fall another hacker around

26
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,689
the nineteen nineties that's how i
learned i have degrees in political

27
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,648
science and journalism now teaching
digital forensics information assurance

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,569
so the first question asked what's a
profession so profession is defined as

29
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:19,560
something that will involves prolong
training in formal qualification and

30
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,650
there's a lot of questions about you
know is what we do a profession or is it

31
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,760
a job or a skill are we different than
welders and plumbers I think that we

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,810
would like to think that we're more like
doctors and lawyers so we're going to

33
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,800
talk about some of those ways and
frameworks to make us more like doctors

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,799
and lawyers there's nothing wrong with
plumbers and welders but we think

35
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,630
probably have a broader view on life and
they do and they they have one job to do

36
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,430
it very well but being a hacker's much
more involved so education versus

37
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:03,720
training training is teaching someone to
do a specific job right called

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,519
vocational training

39
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,130
generally if you're going to be a
electrician you become electricians as

40
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,260
apprentice and you follow around the
electrician and they teach you to skills

41
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,370
of the trade

42
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,120
we're very young and industry where
basically the computer the personal

43
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,709
computers 30 years old I went to college
for the work computers which is amazing

44
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,430
because i don't know how we ever
communicated or knew where each other

45
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,709
was no it's not like you had in 1985 you
could make a facebook event for your

46
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:41,850
kegger and you couldn't use this thing
called the cell phone because if you had

47
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,370
a cell phone you're extremely rich or
extremely purchase pretentious in 1985

48
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,359
so we didn't have the internet till
nineteen ninety five mile long scale and

49
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,799
I've got students who are old as the
internet this point but generally if you

50
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,200
look at it professionally we are very
young profession we didn't have the

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,298
first Def Con into 1993 first MOOC on
2005 and his first derby khan was in

52
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,420
2011 was anyone here for the first derby
con

53
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:21,130
yeah they're becoming I was here too so
we suck at what we do breaches get

54
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:28,659
bigger we lose more and more data every
year we must find a way forward by the

55
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:36,250
way ask matt rebuke and ice upstairs on
the hackers for charity auction I I

56
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,780
don't do attribution so if you with your
in the attribution game need to roll the

57
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,619
dice

58
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:48,310
I think they're loaded for Russia at the
moment they were loaded for China but to

59
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,400
please go check out the acts of charity
auction so education is a formal process

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,070
so how many people have college degrees

61
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,230
ok that's cool that actually one of my
forgot you graduate and you came back

62
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:08,590
for the information insurance
certificate cool so yeah generally we

63
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,539
think that education is worth it in our
society but you know how many people

64
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,700
started out in the hacker culture by
basically going is one they'll remember

65
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,419
mill worm is taking on know where i used
to hang out there is this cycle / . does

66
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,460
anyone go there anymore

67
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,760
Internet Relay Chat still going in and
out every day chat so there's still a

68
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,640
lot of stuff going on and you know once
again if you want to be a lawyer in the

69
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,050
19th century

70
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,380
that's how you became a lawyer you
didn't get an oil firm and IRC but you

71
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,659
do it to the equivalent which was you
apprentice with another lawyer for

72
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,919
specific period of time and then like
Abraham Lincoln you read a bunch of

73
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,900
books by the fireplace and boom you're a
lawyer that's sort of what we're

74
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:05,169
information security has come back from
the past you know Johnnie Cochran and

75
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:10,390
then the rest of the people wearing
suits and arguing the case is nowadays

76
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,520
have gone to law school and they have to
take continuing education

77
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,669
that's true of many different
professions including doctors lawyers

78
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:28,030
etc so what's the past becoming an
information security professional

79
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,840
himself warning training a sense of
security certified professional so I

80
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,599
love the offensive security stuff and
then there's education and all these are

81
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,940
just as legitimate but I think we're
moving beyond the days of self learning

82
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:53,889
and and training and more toward
education and and the interest of full

83
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,610
disclosure I do teach digital forensics
information assurance at university

84
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,900
marshall university but i think that
what we have is we have changing

85
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,030
paradigm hate to use the word paradigm
right so it has the word cyber maybe we

86
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,659
should call it the Cyber paradigm and I
am trade i am trademarking that battle

87
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,849
close your people still that cyber
paradigm should be the name of this talk

88
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:25,090
so you know it's were beyond dropping Oh
days on stage as Chris nickerson says

89
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,508
you know you could stand up here until
oracle to eat me

90
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,800
but the question becomes is that helpful

91
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:40,120
no one home run is helpful so what
framework do we have for penetration

92
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,650
testing

93
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:49,210
there's a few out there but what's the
one pitas right and i use the pitas to

94
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,940
teach all my students because it's very
good framework and this is what I'm

95
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,800
trying I'm trying to say here is that we
need to start moving towards standards

96
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,330
in our industry and start adopting
standards and I think the pitas pretty

97
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,370
widely accepted among the people
probably in this conference but i'm also

98
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:16,539
in on the nice framework and i work on
the National Cyber watch curriculum

99
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:22,509
committee they don't know what pete has
is there still teaching using very old

100
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:26,139
learning objectives and very old
textbooks so part of our

101
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:32,450
part of our profession needs to be to
educate people who are doing the

102
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:38,719
education what real-world skills that
penetration testers need of course

103
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,010
here's another example of that is an
emerging standard but an emerging

104
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,920
standard is better than no standard at
all

105
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:56,750
yes about immigration has info second
we're just going to talk specifically

106
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,830
about penetration testing because that's
an easy example and then we're gonna go

107
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:08,450
on where type of build . like the CIS st
for example so we have accreditations

108
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:16,310
now and we have cissp but it's not
really the breath the best accreditation

109
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:22,819
for penetration testers really think
that we need to look at something I hate

110
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:29,360
to say this and then and we really need
to look at some sort of exam such as

111
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,910
taken by lawyers have to have a CPA
right doctors have to pass boards so as

112
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:44,240
well as having education being
well-rounded individual you have that

113
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:53,060
believe that we need to move toward
standardization of credit even know I

114
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,400
mean osep and I'm security+ so that
means that extend up here and put it

115
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,209
down

116
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:06,650
ya know I don't have it i know of it i
studied for it I've never taken it

117
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,000
because I got a job as college professor
and it really does me no good at this

118
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,900
point so you know women Dave are good
friends of mine and I'm always poking at

119
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:24,079
them i think they're working to make it
better at ISC squares but I don't know

120
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,459
that's perfect

121
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,969
and that's all I'm saying nothing's
perfect at this point and I'm trying to

122
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,420
get everyone to say I don't have all the
answers

123
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,829
where I would be out selling the
solution on $STREET street corner but

124
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,280
I'm just raising the question and part
of this is i like to hear your feedback

125
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,250
and what you think we could do to make
our profession not a trade with a

126
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,140
profession and be held in high esteem
because we are well trained

127
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,030
professionals and do offer like hear
that way now

128
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:05,829
yes sir I don't feel like we're the
business right everybody right when they

129
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,740
jump

130
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,060
oh yeah they wanted you know they want
your own little longer than the hard

131
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:19,390
right yeah and i think that you know IIT
has always been a child center it's like

132
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:24,490
it's not seen as an asset so you know
one of the things that I tried to

133
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,590
instill my students is that were there
to guard what makes that business money

134
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:40,870
into enable whatever makes that business
money so yes sir and 100 s EE talking

135
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,570
about right

136
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:50,770
the reason they see as as houses and
they don't want almost because location

137
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:57,040
okay great bye great we do a very poor
job at an industry of relating to

138
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:09,219
business and we work sort of in our own
narrow areas always bring in crytek's at

139
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,060
strip

140
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:20,500
well what is my business and that always
cotton cover your and thrive and that's

141
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,060
true and i'm seeing more and more
assessments coming my way when I ever

142
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,439
had you consulting in the summertime
this where somebody wants to buy cyber

143
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,530
insurance and they need to make sure
that they're doing what they're supposed

144
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,079
to be doing so if they do have a breach

145
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,370
they're going to get insurance to pay if
someone is but 20 years looking working

146
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,990
in law firm so I know

147
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,399
very well the insurance companies don't
want to play any sort of playing so now

148
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,630
they've sort of have this checklist you
have to go through and unfortunately

149
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,610
it's much closer the compliance and his
actual penetration testing so yes you

150
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,080
check the check boxes but your are you
secure that's a totally different

151
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,180
question

152
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,079
so in case of creating professionals who
step one is education

153
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,250
step two is hands-on skills i don't
think that we have a lot of educational

154
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,730
institutions teaching hands-on skills

155
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:19,240
there's a lot of emphasis on theory and
book learning the issue can get down and

156
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,610
dirty with the tools you're going to
have a much better education yes sir

157
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:37,540
right

158
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
not yet

159
00:13:44,410 --> 00:14:04,360
all right fine right and i think that's
changing now we're seeing more degree

160
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,870
programs come online some more good i
think my own degree program is very good

161
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,670
personally well because we're very happy
holi hands on digital forensics super

162
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,479
make insurance at marshall university so
these people up you're actually using

163
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,089
tools you're using tools are using the
field that includes that includes kali

164
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:28,270
linux metasploit access data then
actually leave school with

165
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,709
certifications on the forensic side and
celebrate too we just came cellphoneshop

166
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:33,979
yes sir

167
00:14:33,980 --> 00:15:02,690
yeah I understand what you're saying and
I think we both need to well I mean in

168
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,740
the case of Education you know for your
education what real while well-rounded

169
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,830
don't make sure they're educated and
those sorts of things hands-on as well

170
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:15,620
protocols network administration is part
of this big ball wax as well as kali

171
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,990
linux and popping boxes using metasploit
so the idea is to give them a very broad

172
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,580
education that's the reason I'm arguing
for education overtraining it's not just

173
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,540
as being able to speak to publix being
able to speak to management as well as

174
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,750
to write well and I think you get that
too for your education process more than

175
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,000
you do through training per se

176
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:52,190
I've got a lot of questions yes we'll
start there in the back right

177
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:58,460
I must have the same maybe don't I'm
once again i'm raising the question and

178
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,490
I'm looking for you all give me feedback
and that's an interesting point

179
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:14,689
why do you have to have that split yes
sir three

180
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:25,689
and Jesus are you understand like
morning

181
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:35,020
well i don't think it's an MBA I i think
that i could put wired up here right now

182
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,490
and he has technical skills and also
those steals to talk to business as well

183
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,880
as speak in public I think it's possible
understand you're coming from

184
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,240
there's a lot of people who are
attracted to our industry that don't

185
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,839
like to talk to people and that's fine
they'll end up in jobs where they don't

186
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,410
have to talk to people but I think for
you to be a well-rounded individual

187
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,000
generally should still have the
opportunity to tap that sort of learning

188
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,320
and lifelong learning and then you may
accelerate it you may not it just

189
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:17,439
depends on watch for your talent lies
mr. what they do i mean that's that's

190
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,030
part of it too is business classes know
in our case and I'm just looking at our

191
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:26,770
model we actually they takin em is class
whether in their job introduced to

192
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,070
business concepts to take a management
class if you can you think of finance

193
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:36,700
class as well but with a management
class because a lot of people will

194
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,600
become managers basically at some point
I'm so i have to understand all that as

195
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:47,949
well and you know there's a lot of I
mean as broad as it can be I think the

196
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:52,690
better it is personally I have to agree
to Liberal Arts which is basically a

197
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,070
never know everyone here is probably
from stem program and Hadrian eyes

198
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,370
always on Twitter Adrian's like all
everyone should go and sin

199
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,070
well not everyone can go in the stem and
not everyone who was good at computers

200
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:12,520
are good math where it's a big tent
basically for industry and I think that

201
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,790
mean exclusionary is problematic

202
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:20,950
I think more well-rounded and the bigger
the tent is the better we are as an

203
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,909
industry in this profession

204
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:31,129
yes sir I your thank you your honor of
you know more about technology and I

205
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:39,469
captain I'm serious technology cissp
going back and getting a business degree

206
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,359
because i want to sell the business I
have to be able to talk to the business

207
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:50,210
and the business language and so I think
places for people who it's like I think

208
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,639
places for people who are each week
going and then there's all the places

209
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:59,988
for people who even working insurance
companies that will they

210
00:18:59,989 --> 00:19:03,859
I'm going to evaluate the wrist so we
don't lose our afterwards but you're

211
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:09,320
exactly right and i think it is part of
this is lifelong learning as well we

212
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,549
just can't get a degree in stop for
lifelong learners for knowledge workers

213
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:17,989
which means that we need to continue to
grow and evolve with the industry yes

214
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,849
sir

215
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:24,320
huh I can't hear you I'm sorry okay

216
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:39,229
right right right yeah i agree i think
that's great and Marshall what we've

217
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:45,200
done is we've rolled up our program into
what's called the school forensics so

218
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,299
its DNA trace forensics criminal justice
and digital forensics that both the

219
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,859
graduate and undergraduate level

220
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,859
yes sir the bond you know take it

221
00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:02,899
yeah yeah yeah

222
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:46,780
41 right on right now you're going too
much more than four years ago by Green

223
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:55,690
right down

224
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,929
that's true and I there are some not
armed

225
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:06,280
well that's what that's what i was going
to say that there are some grants out

226
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,399
there in fact we're applying for 12
can't remember what it's called i think

227
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,220
it's called cyber gym where basically
bringing in kids and and young middle

228
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,960
school girls teacher python we'd like to
give them something we're talking about

229
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:28,840
giving them raspberry PI's actually let
them build a raspberry pi laptop and go

230
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,250
all way through that so that's what
we're working on even we don't get the

231
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,240
grant we're going to do it because money
would be good to have we can't get the

232
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,190
money will partner with well we've got
about Marshall University hackers for

233
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,290
charity group we can raise some money do
that as a local outreach and the other

234
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,370
thing we want to do is make it free now
please teach a summer camp we gotta

235
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:55,600
charge a little bit of money for
overhead if we can get a federal grant

236
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,469
or figure out how to raise the money
through March university hackers for

237
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,820
charity then we could do that for free
as well but yeah part of this is is

238
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,280
outreach and are also going to do a camp
teachers teaspoon pipe on I taught

239
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,970
python two girls the summer had a
wonderful time and I think the teachers

240
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,200
would be another area they can
incorporate something like pie

241
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,929
fun and math classes solving math
problems my thought on for example and

242
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:29,049
they're not getting anywhere else so
we're kind of out looking to do a live

243
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:33,789
out with that coming up this coming
summer already planning on doing that

244
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:36,490
stuff next summer

245
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:41,590
any other questions I don't even know
how much time I have

246
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:51,909
damn ok I'll talk go fast so we do have
culture cultural divide color suits vs

247
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:54,909
hoodies we really need to try to reach
out to each other

248
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:59,049
I'm really sick of the word fought cyber
and putting the word cyber for

249
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,519
everything

250
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:06,070
understand yes is looking at changing
the digital forensics decipher forensics

251
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:13,000
and I just threw up in my mouth a little
bit we enter the intersect in to treat

252
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,659
create a lot drama among ourselves and
then we fight like middle schoolers on

253
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:24,460
Twitter and really like to see that stop
it does not make us look professional

254
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:33,399
we also tend to it turn into second to
an ass showing contest and therefore

255
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:40,570
foul language is part of this but that
you get when you let it all hang out or

256
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,500
you play these games of gotcha with
people it's part of the whole hacker

257
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:52,000
ethic of authorities sucks authorities
bad that's fine inside our community but

258
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,090
we need to probably watch it if you're
not going to gain the trust of

259
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,480
stakeholders back on each other

260
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,480
you know newfags old fags can't traffic
course all that sort of thing and that's

261
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,669
an exaggeration of course but
communication is key and was part of

262
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:17,950
conferences communicating and a thank
you all for coming today how much time

263
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,559
to have now negative one-minute see my
my lectures never get this fast i'm like

264
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:48,520
no that's not right i think those
problems and problems reception right

265
00:24:48,520 --> 00:25:02,950
I don't think everything necessary for
you might not be i think in that alley

266
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:14,590
starting job working for my gray
sweatshirt for stories like this weekend

267
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:24,250
I well I mean the question to me is that
this is something I deserve had served I

268
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,559
don't know all the answers you're
absolutely right

269
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,490
there's been a lot of different
organizations out there i think really

270
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,840
what you want you to take away from this
is that if somebody starts just to

271
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,270
university its well-rounded education
not to discount them as being good

272
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:47,139
hackers and I think that that's
something we have probably have in in

273
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:52,030
the industry that's changing we're
seeing more and more degrees programs

274
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,030
coming online and I think that

275
00:25:55,789 --> 00:26:05,059
no I like I'm just having conversation I
don't know all the answers that will be

276
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:11,029
coming up outside hang out down

277
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:15,080
thank you guys well that'd be great
because i like some honey some water

278
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,519
thank you
