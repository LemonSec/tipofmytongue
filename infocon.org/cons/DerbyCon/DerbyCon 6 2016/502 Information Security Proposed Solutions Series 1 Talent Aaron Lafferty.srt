1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
cool check that out alright well thanks
for coming to the immediately after

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,879
lunch lot otherwise known as the napping
time I'll be handing out carpet squares

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,320
for your comfort and enjoyment here a
little bit later this sort of the

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,880
infosec solution series right so the
first one I'm trying to tackle is the

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,979
talent problem that's me usually stuff
goes here but you know we're already

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,880
late so let's not dwell on that I'll be
here all week so well

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,538
all weekend so you can approach me at
any point in time you will know more

8
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,439
about me

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,930
so the idea behind infosec solution
series is that how many people have been

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,969
going to non-technical talks in the
information security space for for some

11
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,129
time and how many people have been
hearing essentially us talk about the

12
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,230
same problems over and over and over
again and we are really good at talking

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,898
about the problem really good at
defining the problem but actually

14
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,520
proposing solutions to problems are not
really good at that and at the last 1i

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,719
was that I decided you know it would be
really nice to start a series of talks

16
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,260
about actually proposing some solutions
to the problems that we've been hearing

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,570
about for 10 years and if they work
great

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:18,960
it's not well that sucks but you can
throw things at me later right so talent

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,880
problem brief look to spend a minute
about this of everybody sees it in the

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,470
news especially the industry news every
day about how more and more things are

21
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,369
showing up on the internet and how more
and more things need security and how

22
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:38,850
there's a rash of problems with finding
talent because there is no talent out

23
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,669
there and how do we find talent how do
we get people how do we keep people and

24
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,259
we hear about this all the time so it's
hard to find qualified people it's hard

25
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:56,759
to retain them so solving the problem
kinda distill it down into two two basic

26
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,570
things

27
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,740
what's keeping us from attracting and
retaining talent and secondly I

28
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,799
if we can attract or retain talent how
do we address the lack of people and

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,930
skills and information security so I
don't know if anybody's ever seen the

30
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:21,110
show the Prophet Marcus lemonis he's a
very very rich individual who goes to

31
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,510
failing businesses invests in there go
businesses and then makes a TV show out

32
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,870
of it so you can make even more money by
after he's done rescuing your business

33
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,060
we probably won't be making any money
here today but that's fine but he's got

34
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,340
a process that is called the 3 p's its
people process and products and his

35
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,670
basic theories if you get these things
right then you should have a pretty

36
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,970
successful business by simply getting
these things correct so we're gonna have

37
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,920
an infosec talent 3 c's because we don't
want to copy them totally but it's kind

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,980
of nice to have a catchy little process
our cash culture and continuous

39
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,679
improvement

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,040
we're talking about the simplest one
first right it's the most obvious of the

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,230
ball if you need information security
talent and you have a wealth of cash and

42
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,858
a lot of budget you can just start
throwing money at people and eventually

43
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:19,850
they'll show up right because who
wouldn't go to a place when they're

44
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,440
offering you obscene amounts of money
now it's great as that sounds and I

45
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,160
don't want to sway anybody from ever
offering me obscene amounts of money if

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,850
you've got obscene amounts of money
please come talk to me after this arm

47
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,190
aside from being pretty obvious it's
kind of part of our current problem as

48
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,109
well right thing all of us are looking
at the skills we have we're looking at

49
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,370
what the market can bear companies are
looking at the skills we have they're

50
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,819
looking at what the market can bear and
compared to what we were already being

51
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:55,940
paid were all kind of looking for the
next best thing and that is cool for us

52
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,900
especially when we have talent we have
skills that we can market but it's

53
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,579
awfully difficult on a lot of places to
come up with the budget for it

54
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:08,600
the other thing that happens is because
you know basic supply and demand issues

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,888
people see that information security
professionals are making tons of money

56
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,139
and that calls a bunch of people to
field

57
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,680
don't necessarily have any skills or
knowledge they just see the fact that

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,740
hey if I'm in this career i'm going to
make a lot of money so expectations and

59
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,120
and our requirements are looking pretty
high but money is a way that you can

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,740
bring in talent if you happen to have it
one of the ways that you can use this

61
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,249
money to help reduce the amount of
headaches you have this if you build

62
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:41,939
really good relationships with HR
because obviously if you're looking for

63
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:44,249
these positions and you're willing to
pay for them

64
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:47,370
people are going to start applying for
them so how do you build a good

65
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,449
relationship with HR with your
information security theoretically you

66
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,689
should already have some relationships
with human resources right you know

67
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:58,860
they're responsible for terminations and
that could bring in information security

68
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,099
they're responsible for hiring which
means they've got a whole bunch of

69
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:06,719
personal information so hopefully you've
been in on speaking with them about how

70
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:10,650
they take that information and how they
store that information and occasionally

71
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,029
how they just have random questions
aside from that you know being a human

72
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,479
being

73
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,680
go over talk to him every now then don't
don't be the creepy overbearing stalker

74
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,580
type person but you know build up a an
actual human relationship with him so

75
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,120
that they've got some familiarity with
you and you've got some familiarity with

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,319
them so that you can do important things
like partner with them on job

77
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,710
descriptions and it's always great when
we sit down and we write job

78
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,710
descriptions but it's even better to
work with HR people because they've been

79
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,989
doing this for years and in a lot of
ways they know how to word things in an

80
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,389
appropriate way to keep with the mission
and and culture of of your employer

81
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,229
whereas when we write a job description
for like AI want this I want this I like

82
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:57,419
this and so when you make a job
description one of the most important

83
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,169
things you can do is review all the
resumes because if you're using an

84
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,068
automated talent system i don't know if
you know spend a lot of time playing

85
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,250
with a lot of times they've got
questions they look for keywords and

86
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,509
they're filtering out resumes before
they even come back to the HR people and

87
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:17,639
why is this important to focus on job
descriptions and read all the resumes so

88
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,649
let's take this job description here i'm
looking for a mythological beast so I

89
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,879
want a unicorn and this unicorn is going
to run around its going to do unicorn

90
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,670
things in unicorn places and

91
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,910
you really great if they had like five
to ten years of unicorn experience

92
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:37,340
additional requirements in addition to
being a completely mythological beasts

93
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,090
that you would almost never find they
need to be plaid they also need to

94
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,229
breathe fire and they should have a
cissp because we like to have our

95
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:52,790
unicorn certified so bunch of people
apply to the job they say hey this

96
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,380
unicorn field is pretty hot right now I
want to get into the unicorn field and

97
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:05,090
they apply to your job so you get your
resumes here's your applications like

98
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:14,090
okay like okay yeah i don't i don't see
anything in the in there and the jobs or

99
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,260
my applicants that actually totally
matches my requirements right and this

100
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,640
sort of mirrors real-life you almost
never get an applicant that that is

101
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:29,810
everything that you want so yeah we we
don't have a unicorn the breeze fire we

102
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,920
do have a unicorn and he's wearing a
hoodie so that's a plus right fits right

103
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,350
in there and we have a plan unicorn but
and maybe that planet unicorn doesn't

104
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,560
really have the years of experience with
that we want they seem a little young in

105
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,290
the career and then we've got this this
other guy here not unicorn at all but it

106
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:52,550
but it's a llama and he does have a horn
that kind of makes in unicorns and he

107
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,020
does breathe fire but he's not plaid but
he has a set of wings so obviously he's

108
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,400
got another skill that you didn't even
think about that he could fly so as big

109
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,840
as flying more important than being
planned i don't know right but it

110
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,760
certainly shows some adaptability on the
creatures part so might be able to

111
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:18,349
consider him as a candidate so you know
what this leads to be 22 including is

112
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:24,140
are we sometimes little too focused on
our actual technology solutions you know

113
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,240
when we write a job description

114
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,710
are we being a little too focused on our
exact technology so you know when you

115
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,350
say hey I want to 10 years of cisco a SI
experience should we really be looking

116
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,800
at it as a more holistic I want ten
years of firewall experience

117
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,760
and the reason for this is you know how
many people and information security are

118
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,899
doing exactly the same thing that they
were doing a year ago when our field

119
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:54,959
changes and it changes a lot so that
tends to if you look at even if you look

120
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,500
at your own career development and you
realize that you're very very adaptable

121
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,670
and in your skills and your skills are
somewhat mutable your application for

122
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:11,250
applicants for your job are probably
much the same way so the other thing is

123
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,050
now we're practicing the the cash part
of it is once you've identified that

124
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,339
applicant when you talk to them about
how much money it is there going to be

125
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,880
making you actually have to do some
research on what their market value is

126
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,450
and be willing to pay the market value
because how also they're going to take

127
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,279
you seriously unless you're really
really awesome place which brings us to

128
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:38,519
culture right so you've got to be a
place that people actually want to work

129
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,850
for if if you're a terrible place to
work

130
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,640
it doesn't matter how much money you
offer somebody because they're going to

131
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,120
show up for a little while they're going
to collect a paycheck and they're gonna

132
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,779
be like thanks I've collected enough
money that i can afford to go look for

133
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:57,839
another job and contrary to popular
belief you don't have to change your

134
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,480
entire corporate identity in order to
have a good work culture and the other

135
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,399
thing is if your work culture is bad and
everybody at least in your geographical

136
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,760
region is going to know that your work
culture is bad and that you should ever

137
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,930
go to work for this place so having a
good work culture for information

138
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,930
security people i mean we all work
really really hard

139
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,880
we all struggle to keep up with things
so you have just a basic respect for one

140
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,329
another

141
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:32,040
professionally doesn't mean you still
can't be a jerk because they sometimes

142
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,300
you just gotta be a jerk but the basic
respect for each other in the people

143
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,979
that work for you appreciate all the
effort that they put in compliment them

144
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,430
on on that and you know how all of their
successes

145
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,109
I didn't put this up here but you know
credit for good ideas make sure that if

146
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,730
they have good ideas that

147
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,490
to when they get champion that they get
credit for those challenges information

148
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,870
security people we all love challenges
right if we were doing the same thing is

149
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,220
look at if we're looking at the same
alert every day in the ids system we

150
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:13,260
really like going to work anymore not
really right be flexible so you know you

151
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,389
may not be in a place that's necessarily
normally conducive to say working from

152
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:23,610
home or you know flexible hours or
things like that is a even if you don't

153
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,540
have like a work-from-home policy you
actually have a work-from-home policy

154
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,189
because what happens at 3am on a Sunday
morning you're working from home right

155
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,360
so even if you don't have a
work-from-home policy there is an

156
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,000
expectation that you work from home so
in return for long hours and for return

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,980
for all sorts of other responsibilities
be flexible with your peoples time you

158
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,610
know make it so that they can actually
do life things during the hours in which

159
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,060
apparently every other business thinks
it's appropriate to be open while you're

160
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,410
at work give up give a little
flexibility and then feedback loops

161
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,120
well this is where you actually sit
people down and you actually have honest

162
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,779
conversations with them in terms of all
the good things that they're doing and

163
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,410
all of the things that they can improve
because none of us don't screw up and we

164
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,209
all kind of don't want to write so it's
nice to know that you know you can have

165
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:19,349
an honest non-threatening conversation
with somebody and tell them their

166
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:25,560
opportunities to improve so what happens
if a bag if you have a bad culture

167
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,410
well not surprisingly your employees
leave and not only do they leave but

168
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,100
there's a lot of employees shaming that
goes on when you have a bad work culture

169
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,500
and especially in columbus we're really
close tight-knit information security

170
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,250
community and if somebody leaves
accompany you know like oh yeah we

171
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,930
noticed that you into a new job you know
what's the reasoning for and it's the

172
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,160
reasoning for is now the management
socks and they don't take anything

173
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,990
seriously and they treat you like crap
is a guess what that company isn't going

174
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:03,269
to be hiring anybody for about 200 miles
around central ohio which is going to

175
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:04,360
force them to

176
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,190
try to import talent that then gets
imported and then leaves about six

177
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,459
months after they hire them and comes in
complaints about the same things that

178
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,268
they would have known about had they
been part of central Ohio so employees

179
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:20,709
gaming is a thing and this can seriously
hurt your recruitment efforts your

180
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:25,959
efforts not just an information security
but in any of your jobs especially IT

181
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:31,390
related jobs if you're not careful about
your work culture so keep your culture

182
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:38,380
something that that people want to work
for continuous improvement were all

183
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,240
knowledge workers right it's not like we
go out and we do some physical labor

184
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,290
that at the end of the day we see the
results of what we done you know we

185
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,760
don't go out and build barns we don't go
out till dig trenches everything we work

186
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,700
with is is some sort of information or
some sort of knowledge and the price of

187
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,769
working with information and knowledge
is but you need to continuously refresh

188
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,950
the information and the knowledge that
you're working with because your

189
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,269
environment and the things that you're
working with are continually changing as

190
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:17,470
well so lots of good data that you can
talk to any recruiting firm about

191
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,570
because they do lots of studies on on on
placing individuals and they will tell

192
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,399
you that they get less people were
recruited out of companies that have

193
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,720
training programs for their information
security staff apparently we are one of

194
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,250
the most mobile sets especially because
of demand and so we tend to stay at

195
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,870
places that will get us training and we
tend to leave places that won't get us

196
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,440
training and we'll head for the places
that will get us training so if you're

197
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,709
having problems with retaining
information security people and you

198
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:52,750
don't have a good methodology of keeping
them trained consider an actual training

199
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,410
budget where they do one or two training
sessions a year

200
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,870
don't necessarily have to send them out
to you know sands conference you can do

201
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,930
web training most of us I think are
pretty good with doing whatever is

202
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:10,930
actually available but you know get them
training because

203
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:16,810
I don't remember who to attribute the
tweet too but I saw one says if you're

204
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,008
not investing in training your funding
failure and just as the thing up here

205
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:24,040
says it's like well what if we train
them and they leave and the next

206
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,930
question is well what if we don't train
them and they stay because this point

207
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,199
out the problems of your knowledge is
getting stale

208
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,099
if you're not working to increase your
knowledge and that makes you less

209
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,819
effective and that makes you less
effective as a professional and it makes

210
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:44,920
you less effective for your organization
and so part of the organizational

211
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,360
culture needs to be recognition that
knowledge workers need to keep their

212
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,680
knowledge up-to-date so that the benefit
of having them around as employees

213
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,378
employees it's sort of like a false or a
force multiplier at that point so that

214
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:08,439
covers are three C's so so you can't
necessarily find your candidate even

215
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:13,059
with all the cash and the culture and
and the continuous improvement

216
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:19,269
you just can't war people who are in the
field over so what's your other option

217
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:24,009
right now I saw this couple of weeks ago
and I guess you can't maybe read it from

218
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:27,370
the screen that says produce great
people and the rest will follow

219
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,620
this is on the door of the roycroft in
which is like an art collective

220
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:38,350
community nice place and it makes a lot
of sense right so then your other option

221
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,490
is to build it up

222
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,260
and you can do this through mentorship
you can do this through interns you can

223
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,899
do this through trainees so let's talk a
little bit about mentorship and you see

224
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:51,680
up there

225
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,819
this is a picture of Athena does anybody
know why there's a picture of Athena up

226
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,740
here

227
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:06,230
alright so anybody read The Odyssey so
in the Odyssey you know Odysseus is gone

228
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,490
his son Telemachus is still on the
island his wife is still on the island

229
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,620
everybody thinks Odysseus is dead so
there's a whole bunch of suitors on the

230
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,760
island because whoever gets to marry
Odysseus is wife gets all of his stuff

231
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:28,099
apparently he has lots of cool stuff so
climacus is is there that's this is the

232
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:31,399
Sun as I said he's really confused about
what to do about all these suitors

233
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,330
because and they're really really
irritating and they're stubborn and

234
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:41,120
they're very demanding and athena comes
down to earth and she takes the form of

235
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,100
this guy he already knows and the guys
name is mentees and she starts giving to

236
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,159
limit his advice on how to deal with the
suitors

237
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,440
so long story short you know they have a
competition Odysseus is there is he's a

238
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,270
dressed as a beggar ods wins the
competition the suitors get mad battle

239
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,520
ensues all of the suitors are wiped out

240
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,150
k disease home big parade so what does
this mean this is kind of an appeal to

241
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,330
your ego when I say this when when your
mentor

242
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,059
you're like an ancient Greek goddess or
God who is telling your mentee to go out

243
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,750
and kick some ass right so how can you
not like that

244
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:29,480
so mentorship if you're going to have
mentorship a one of the first places you

245
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,200
should probably look is inside of your
company because it's always great to

246
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,450
look inside of your company for budding
talent and find ways to make use of that

247
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,830
talent if you make use of that talent
typically that says something about your

248
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,439
culture says you're willing and able to
recognize people inside who are already

249
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,159
there and actually do something with
them and give them a career path that's

250
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:59,179
really good for your brand as a as a
workplace culture not only that but when

251
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,980
you take somebody that's already there

252
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,549
they have a lot of that institutional
knowledge which is somewhat difficult to

253
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:08,059
gain when your brand new employee so
chances are really good that they

254
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,059
already have some relationships that
they already have some institutional

255
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,869
knowledge that you can leverage and you
can spend more time focusing on

256
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:19,070
individual skills that are part of the
job rather than importing all of the

257
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:25,789
tribal knowledge our reach out to
schools universities are in more and

258
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,330
more frequently coming up with
information security programs

259
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:33,259
I'm not necessarily that the people
graduating know everything about the job

260
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:36,259
that's more table stakes at this point
right

261
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:41,240
the setting a bar that says you should
probably know this much before you start

262
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,600
this career and they all intersect
related forums and professional

263
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,959
societies are good places to go to look
for mentors as well inside of your

264
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,039
organization mentorship now I think
we're all pretty familiar with you know

265
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:03,950
the standard mentor-mentee type
relationship so I'm going to put for

266
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,470
something that this been going on in
educational institutions for quite some

267
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,570
time it's called the Triad coaching
model are so where this comes from in

268
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,799
education is if you want to be a new
teacher you start out as a student

269
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,539
teacher so in this case you're the
mentee and when you go to a school you

270
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:29,419
start working with an actual mentor
teacher obviously the mentor and then a

271
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:33,470
representative of your school that's
part of the education program is also

272
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,110
there with

273
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:39,419
sing everything that goes on and that's
the observer so all of a sudden your

274
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:46,230
mentor has basically to your mentee
actually has two mentors right and how

275
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,580
this works is that the observer watches
both the mentor teacher and they watch

276
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,799
the student and they see what's working
in terms of things going on in the class

277
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,030
things going on a relationship and as
well as looking at how what they're

278
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,440
doing aligns with the educational
directives of of the program and they

279
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,130
sit down and they go through a bunch of
feedback with this so i think we should

280
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:15,120
take this particular model bring it into
our organizations where now each entity

281
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,139
will have two mentors in your
organization you'll be able to say one

282
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,580
of you is the is the observer you get to
observe the relationship watch the job

283
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,939
skills being imparted observe what's
working what's not working get their

284
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,830
perspectives and coach both of them not
only that but that will leave the mentor

285
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,909
sort of free to impart a lot of the job
based skills and then you can talk to

286
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,990
the mentor and mentee about how those
job basically is aligned with business

287
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,100
objectives and and what your
organization does so that you have a

288
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,260
good operating knowledge of as a mentee
what's going on in your organization and

289
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,280
what plate

290
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,760
what part you played it because we all
love to know what part we played things

291
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,580
right and understand why what we do is
important

292
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:03,629
outside of the of your organization
again universities got student groups

293
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:09,270
you've got groups there that are focused
on information security that didn't

294
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,840
necessarily exist 10 years ago
professional groups again and this gives

295
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,059
you a chance to pass on your not only
your technical skills but experience and

296
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,928
some of the socialization skills as well
because you know the longer you've been

297
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:26,669
in the community the more chance you had
to practice different socialization

298
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:30,540
techniques and so that you can tell
people like when you run into this type

299
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,230
of person you should probably talk to
them in in this particular way so that

300
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,330
they can be more effective as
communicators interns and college hires

301
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,860
are another way to build up the
information security talent $YEAR pole

302
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,500
what do they usually bring lots and lots
of enthusiasm

303
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,950
Diaz of these people are coming out of
school and most of the time they're

304
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:56,470
getting their first job ever and they're
really excited about it are fresh eyes

305
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,130
old problems right we're all sort of
captured by the knowledge and experience

306
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:06,940
that that we've had over our career and
that's not necessarily sometimes it's

307
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,390
nice to have fresh eyes because we look
at something in a particular way in like

308
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,000
yeah we've tried that before it's not
going to work

309
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,670
I these people come in they don't have
that to sort of cage their their frame

310
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,870
of focus and they see it in a wider nose
and a whiter light and can suggest

311
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,800
things that maybe you didn't think about
and they have lots of energy that goes

312
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:35,620
that goes without enthusiasm so what do
they need time lots and lots of time

313
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,570
your program will take a bit of a hit in
terms of productivity but you should

314
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,399
look at that as a return on investment
because by the time I you've trained

315
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,030
them up so that they can do the job
you've got an extra body and that twenty

316
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,450
percent that you were behind for a
couple of months goes away really really

317
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:57,520
fast if you're looking at building up
your program over the course of several

318
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,680
years and you've got an intern that
you're going to be bringing in or a

319
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,570
natural training for higher every year
i'll come up with a very focused and

320
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,710
repeatable methodology for for training
them in that first year you're going to

321
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:16,570
be doing everything ad hoc sao catalog
all that capture it document it and at

322
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,110
the end of it go through it with your
training go through with your intern and

323
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,360
say alright we did all this

324
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,260
what worked what didn't and if you've
got the observer then you can go ahead

325
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,970
and they can contribute to that as well
and then each year have so that after

326
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,630
action review where you go through and
refine your process but make it focused

327
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:43,900
and make it repeatable and that folks is
all I've got questions money

328
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,750
alright thank you
