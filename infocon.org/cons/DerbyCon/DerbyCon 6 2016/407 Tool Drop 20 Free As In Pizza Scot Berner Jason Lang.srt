1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,370
you guys are still okay you got it yeah
squared away again thank you so much for

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,259
coming to tools are out to do this is a
way to drop one last year and it was on

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,580
the phone this talk where there is I
know slides of any kind actually that's

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,240
a lie and looking at it so I know that
this dog is all downloads go to

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,159
punishment so we're doing this talk is
we are really simple as that we bring as

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,809
penetration testers the last year and
you know you'll find that the commentary

7
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,269
for a lot of these things is basically
we got sick of doing able to the task

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,800
and so we automated and gold really make
our lives easier and these are tools

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,440
that we use during our patients all the
time so we're releasing into the

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,059
community so you guys could use as well
hopefully enjoy what we find some use

11
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,410
out of it and it's like i said is the
only thing we're taking your picture

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,519
right now after this is all just typing
so if you have questions while being

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,550
shot your questions I don't know the
words we can have time and we will put

14
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,720
that was just wanted to the end and
those questions always connected twitter

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,798
and get in touch with that so that's it
we're going to start with our first tool

16
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,509
called spin up and i'm going to bring
the author Iran's lock who's actually

17
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,189
going to talk us through we did a movie
for this particular tool instead of

18
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:26,189
actual I don't just because of heavy
lines on the internet so that we can

19
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,119
move

20
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:37,439
alright so on as Jesus mention when we
depend on how do you test it

21
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,460
yeah try turning up and you'll see
you'll see everyone will see all right

22
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:54,480
alright so when we don't ask oftentimes
will be running our tools from amazon

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,470
cloud just because we don't want to burn
all private IP space and we found

24
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,100
ourselves every time we want to do an
engagement or stamp new listeners would

25
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,360
take about an hour

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,510
are you know 40 minutes to provision
system get all the dependencies

27
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,630
installing so far so we figured we gotta
make this right

28
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,480
there's a lot to do a closed flexible
and agile so what we did here is called

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,649
spin up and one man line can fire an
empire instance up on the cloud to go

30
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,920
ahead and get started and we have a few
switches here over a little but you can

31
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,609
choose different types of systems you
want to applications you want to

32
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,530
provision so preventable medical you can
do pen testers framework to empire or if

33
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,970
you just want to do just a plain system
and fire shelter area back to interact

34
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,430
with it so we're going to just go ahead

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,850
right on they want Empire instance you
want to say what port wanted to listen

36
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:57,209
up so it's really cool that we're
interacting with amazon CPI presumably

37
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,610
interacting with a mistake and what
we're doing is we're gonna go ahead and

38
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,019
fired up as we're firing port 443 we
want to not only set up a listener on

39
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:13,170
empire on that port world wherein
provision p the firewall rules to allow

40
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,500
that traffic away from seed want to go
to manually do this the webui all on

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,340
command to it that we also are fast
forwarding your table for me to actually

42
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,700
fire the image itself but now we're
going through it downloading the

43
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,549
dependencies

44
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,380
installing on the system there's a lot
of dependencies when it comes to

45
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,390
different systems especially displayed
in a pile something source of loss so

46
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,600
it's a bit of a pain but this case here
were setting up empire with the RESTful

47
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,410
API so you can actually interact with
the system programming Lee to get the

48
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,390
stage and he said so far the other thing
that this tool can do is if you have a

49
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:55,959
if you're using Amazon's route 53 which
is their dns service you can program

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,330
ibly assign the fqdn to your instance so
in this case they were standing in Nomos

51
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,380
name potato and they don't want it fires
up here you'll actually see that full

52
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,990
domain has been assigned to this system
with the listen to me so i reconcile

53
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,340
these are all the rage assist system so
we can see that we have a listener that

54
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:23,350
did not assign us a promise it works but
it's over a ps4 . we have the largest

55
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,550
look at any point you know ever lose
your instance this morning and screen so

56
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,250
you can just connect 154 coffee shop and
come back up

57
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,840
that's it comes up on get up

58
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:43,150
so if you have any problems ignition
signs

59
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,140
next up is a Scot talk to us about a
little bit

60
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:04,780
alright so this is a powershell module
and what happened here is we found out

61
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,090
where this year

62
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,669
someone just because conference glanders
talk about a delicious order attack that

63
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:18,250
will allow you to single rule to someone
decline of a look and then that will

64
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,440
sink you execute binary and then that
would if you have to control the machine

65
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,760
so I was like that's amazing i set it up
there was a manual i want to automate

66
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,570
this so i started off her house in
powershell and I

67
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,680
there's a whole point of this ends up
that is not possible to polish off so i

68
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,540
have a tool and uses API provided by
Microsoft once again next Microsoft is

69
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,710
what we write and interacts with
something called the exchange web

70
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,340
service now how many of you guys are
familiar with exchange rates change

71
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:03,409
admins okay so-so exchange has a web
service that is published publicly by

72
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,600
default and I don't know exactly what
that is what other end to this but

73
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,400
functionality to people's mail box so
you can tell me I'll get mail Iraq and

74
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:20,929
all the features that exchange offers
several clients like a little so what

75
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,910
happens is i want to repent and Trish
testing a lot of times on external test

76
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:33,050
one of the things that I frequently look
for is a credentials and feel the paper

77
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,970
single-factor endpoints so one of the
great things is only interface which is

78
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,520
also part exchange offers the
opportunity to get these things so if

79
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,969
your own tests and you started to bring
the external perimeter and you see this

80
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,750
I you can start to get very happy

81
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,610
so the one of the good things about all
of that is also attached active

82
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,480
directory so you know most environments
are very happy videos focus active

83
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,140
directory the center of all education
within within windows environment and

84
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,070
this time right to get so intense and
you know nine times out of a hundred

85
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:13,280
this is a single factor is their
schooling so what you gonna do is

86
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,299
download the toolkit you get up and you
go in here and look at what you got to

87
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,450
get a really the powershell module has
get help feature so if you install the

88
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,890
module and you're looking for help

89
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:29,419
examples for all the modules all the
functions of the module and what you do

90
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:36,740
is you just import the module type
correctly that you get a little warning

91
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,540
because i used verbs that partial
doesn't like like steel and route

92
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,610
service so this functions that are
exposed here once before this module is

93
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,300
module does have it depends e so the
dependency is that you need to install

94
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,870
microsoft AWS sdk and that just gives
you a deal that they use that kind of

95
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,620
abstracts although the web service calls
to that exchange web service that were

96
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,620
talking about

97
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:36,200
so you do i git commands not anyway
we'll skip back so the one of the first

98
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,300
things you can do here is one of the
functions called scanning of us and what

99
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:45,770
this does is it something that I had
done manually many times is just a dns

100
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:51,020
group or subdomain certain top-level
domain we just passed a top-level domain

101
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,819
in this case we're going to use your
core we set up a small test remain here

102
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,540
with DC and exchange and that's why my
fingers are crossed for this demo

103
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,650
because it's just running all of this
laptop so fingers crossed

104
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,920
what this will do is it will scan of
course very submarines are very common

105
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:19,010
to have a lot or exchange web search on
them here once it finds a possible link

106
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,210
to exchange web services just prints
that to the screen so you see this very

107
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,700
commonly as exchange cold water but now
if you pass the proposed function here

108
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,530
you can see all the domains that it's
actually testing with now one thing one

109
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,069
caveat here is very frequently you know
you'll get some environments like

110
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,090
one-off will be like you know who knows
maybe it's a lotus notes but it's

111
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:46,520
actually exchanged i do really recommend
that you manually look for this stuff

112
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,840
you can definitely use it to find that
that exchange web service at any other

113
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,800
paths you can use

114
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,459
URL later in the tool as well so once
you've detected webservice I talked

115
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,829
briefly earlier about the bushes look
cool functionality isn't yet automated

116
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:14,180
within this toolkit but you can scan for
something called that may be happy is

117
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,890
interface that's open for this that
allow the client-side world to see

118
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,760
unfortunately it's a pretty complicated
protocol and when I got into this like i

119
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,939
was saying it wasn't distracted with our
shell plc guy but that another person

120
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,220
has automated that a tool called ruler
which i highly recommend you guys check

121
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,040
out alright so here's a surprise

122
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,620
microsoft actually uses their own stuff
so babies exposed microsoft again you

123
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,170
can pass this proposed tag is just doing
a quick penis group and then once it

124
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,699
finds possible places where that might
exist it doesn't justify request and it

125
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,829
gets the right response code princess

126
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:05,989
so once you've detected that
organization has ups exposed the next

127
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,920
you want to do is you want to reinforce
and one of things i really like about

128
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,540
this is that sense it's time to eat
you're gonna get eprice it's very

129
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,610
commonly single-factor I've actually
seen companies that have pulled up the

130
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,170
only way back access peace be to factor
but the web service for exchange is

131
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:33,110
actually still single backer which is
really nice so which gives you your type

132
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,449
awesome so there's a function expose
your called ews and you're gonna pass

133
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:42,770
this all these different parameters you
can see the first one is the password i

134
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,770
highly recommend just doing like season
year

135
00:11:46,610 --> 00:12:02,959
it is better to use the branches
personal just the password second one of

136
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,500
the target list that's just a single
text file with users in it

137
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,959
the next one is the exchange version now
the exchange version you're gonna have

138
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,920
to get that prior to doing this it's
actually pretty simple to get if you

139
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,599
find a little page go there

140
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,980
view source and then the exchange
virtual be in the JavaScript they're

141
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,399
loading in just the exact patched
version so you can just google that

142
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:34,190
finding her passing the EWS path and
domain enter cross your fingers hope

143
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,690
this works

144
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:42,860
yes alright were surprised . so this is
actually a multi-threaded powershell

145
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,079
reporter for this service which see
here's a list of users

146
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,370
I only tried one password for user and
then you can see that it successfully

147
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,709
authenticated with Tico vehicle for
spring 2016 what I do at that point is

148
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,640
i'm using my exchange service to make a
call and see how many unread emails

149
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,890
ahead first has just to verify that it's
actually working now we're talking about

150
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:17,510
here again so one of the things that
toolkit does is it creates an object

151
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:22,040
partial are familiar with our shell is a
nice day and structure is one of the

152
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,529
things that makes partially nice and
this object is actually interface to

153
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:30,410
that dll that microsoft made for you yes

154
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,100
so if you initialize this object you can
do it outside the toolkit just using the

155
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,730
function and you can see

156
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:56,270
you see that there's a ton of methods
here now this toolkit abstract every

157
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,020
single one of these methods are always
options you notice but you can see

158
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,560
there's things like search mailboxes one
of the things that are working on

159
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,449
version after this one is searching
people's all the notes across the

160
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:08,960
enterprise

161
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,590
I don't know how to use your interest in
face testing but it's very common that

162
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,760
people would passwords and they're all
the villages or will have so many

163
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,860
systematics do that ahead

164
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,240
it has a full-time i'm making I'm making
a way to scan that's use you know dr.

165
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,080
Manley going to each mailboxes as well
as things kind of current theme is find

166
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:34,160
myself manually going through and doing
this and so now Tom it was your creds

167
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,430
first thing you do when you get dressed
email your want to check it out right so

168
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,329
the automated pillaging piece here one
of the best things about you two guesses

169
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,970
that extend exposes the global address
book

170
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,010
how many guys little as $MONEY per rack
so I found myself every time doing this

171
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,030
i have like fire / go through it like
scroll through the whole address book

172
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,829
like take out the text of everyone's
email like director whatever I I did

173
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,850
that a couple times like this is all on
you just need to automate this what you

174
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:21,560
can do you can take the exchange object
to be created earlier is it there

175
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,859
alright so one of the other functions to
expose just called steel Gail

176
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:32,030
what-what-what steel does so this
function was not exposed yes there's not

177
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,470
a way to just say give me all the people
devoted all his but what you can do is

178
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,970
search for a specific name and which was
your search brooklyn one character I

179
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,960
finally put like a user for one
character you get like honey max 100

180
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:51,320
results so it still killed us is it
recursively goes through it will go for

181
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,220
every letter of the alphabet and then if
you return them out in more than 100 it

182
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,000
will send another letter to that so yes

183
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,880
a-and then you know just reverses the
only those three layers deep but I have

184
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,790
stolen girls that have been multiple
thousands so I don't know about hundreds

185
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,420
of balance

186
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,020
so how do i haven't tested that yet but
multiple thousands this works now one of

187
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,730
the things that's great about this is it
returns it as an object as well so you

188
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,790
really are shell all the power that
there's an office here you could pass it

189
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,790
to you in the pipeline to other things
as well

190
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,370
this is also a standalone function so
you can you still get out if you already

191
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:38,310
know password you just do that without
making the object like this now this one

192
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,260
so one of the real harsh of my favorite
man this is the upgrade of you so you

193
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,430
could help get that off don't give you
have all your users here is trying to

194
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,300
start something specific or fish people
have all the equation there for the next

195
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,839
thing I do here is once i get the global
address book i take and all the usual i

196
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,500
got this i've probably got a subset of
users for public information gathering

197
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,109
I'll take all the users to go back again
and get most likely more credits so the

198
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,020
other thing is when you once you've
gotten credentials you know every

199
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,740
penetration testers after you know
she'll access to internal network go

200
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,430
back and see if there's no single factor
other endpoints like Citrix or you can

201
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:22,860
use credit there and you single back
alright it

202
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:33,929
questions questions for your oh yes
hello

203
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,250
one of the one of the things that my
colleagues has put in a bunch of code of

204
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,780
this point since I get it all working
for the devil here but we did we had a

205
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,550
simple database and what it does is it
store specials things like that stores

206
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,040
information you might need to do this
kind of operation

207
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,300
it also allows you to schedule the
group's so a lot of times we'll know

208
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,620
that people lack of windows 30 minutes
so you scheduled to go over 40 minutes

209
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,969
and then

210
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,350
golden angie's list and then you're
going to application things like that so

211
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,240
few things to come

212
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,670
I'm actually mentioned I was going to
talk about things maybe next time is

213
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,440
good segue so yes I love accounts but
eventually we're not too

214
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,180
yeah so the dependencies you need to i
like a record partial version by that's

215
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,760
coated on its attack to let me just get
the latest show building is to install

216
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:49,320
microsoft exchange was just beside have
cool stuff we got one last will show you

217
00:18:49,320 --> 00:19:00,389
that i'm baking want to see better head
is so we're going to show you is that is

218
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:06,300
its local lucky strike lucky strike is a
utility that was built really obsessed

219
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,970
we as penetration testers we use social
engineering and one of the tasks that we

220
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,710
do frequently when we have to social
events be said and all started as much

221
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,600
macro if your ancestor you are very
familiar with this routine I you you

222
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,560
fire up unicorn or you fire up so until
that's going to give you publish all

223
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,970
these macro or an extra-base macro and
you have to open excel or your own word

224
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,170
taste all the magma code into much
testing my work might not be picked up

225
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,760
by a bee it might not

226
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,760
we got sick of this so this started as
my grandchild I guess when I was like

227
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,300
you know i'm tired of doing this pass
over and over and over again so i wanted

228
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,710
something that's going to take a like a
unicorn outdoor Empire State you're out

229
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,120
what I just make a quick and excel doc
we have one to sell dogs will actually

230
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,989
show you it's one of our favorite
templates calendar it says you have to

231
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,190
enable contact and we send users it's
like we get shells all the time valley

232
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,090
and so it's just one of those things
where we got sick up to

233
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,929
doing the same repeated task and over
again and so I was like right that's

234
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,230
where this is going to start and then
the team started trying instant wait a

235
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:16,070
second what if we want to use that
payload is there a way to pay that we

236
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:20,300
save the paper to use it and things like
that so that more students walk into a

237
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:27,830
hole something else I and it's not a
framework that it's an extensible

238
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:36,169
modular framework based on know Jas not
ourselves ourselves better so I I lucky

239
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,520
strike is currently gonna get up I there
is really going out to do in order to

240
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,560
install is run this little is command
right here before you panic i will

241
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:51,590
actually talk to with the install the
obvious one is so install happy this

242
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:58,040
morning all this is going to do on the
backend is it's going to download an

243
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,470
important one dependency that lucky
strike which is PS module what happens

244
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:09,770
on the backend and I go through all the
time table creation because I the the

245
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,610
way that I'm making matters worse is if
you're familiar with making wish macros

246
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,909
you have steak o dependencies and code
block dependencies just like you do for

247
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,350
making any other kind of macro but in
this case Lucky Strike stores all of the

248
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:26,449
matter of fancies in the database is
code blocks and you can see for example

249
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:30,170
you know this is where we had our own
personal obfuscation as decided by sa be

250
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,400
if that's your worry about having these
feelings you picked up maybe well yes it

251
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,630
they they can you picked up and all the
testing that I've done only to the

252
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,920
people have gotten picked up and maybe
get picked up by a pass and get picked

253
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,970
up by climbing p so anyways

254
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:50,669
it won't use that so let's actually show
you what was picking up from started

255
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:54,270
actually very divided into this so I
anymore have questions you can see just

256
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,260
let me know I'm gonna be walking through
a lot of different attacks so this is

257
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,309
the output will see you after running
the the installation you're only going

258
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:09,120
to see a going to create a lucky strike
directly for you and it's gonna only

259
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,459
have two files and LSD which is the
single light back into database scripts

260
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:20,070
sell the script itself is a name
transcript and you have to forgive me

261
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,799
because I I've been getting these menus
for months now so if I go too fast i

262
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,639
just tell me to slow down and we can
certainly do that so if you can't see

263
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:38,610
that apologize i don't know i don't know
how much was that we want to resize the

264
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:43,229
window let's let's try resizing window

265
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,980
I got a little bit ok so I've
terminology listen terminology wrote

266
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,490
books here lost in terms I that there
are three different terms are going to

267
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,630
use repeatedly the first time as payload
halo is something that actually that is

268
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,000
what you want to be fire on your target

269
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,500
this is made specifically for fish so
and critical is macro and outputs the

270
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,610
SLS you send your targets are
questionable content and then it does

271
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,600
whatever you want to do that's
configured they look the same technology

272
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,939
for the second term i'm going to use
catalog catalog is basically my of the

273
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,020
word that is the database so I you're
gonna take a payload you're going to add

274
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,590
a payload to the catalog and then that
it was going to be available in the

275
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,320
catalog for selecting

276
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,730
making your religious matters the whole
point is for usability like i said if i

277
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,750
had a $MONEY if i have a mighty empire
one of my Empire servers is generally

278
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,570
have the same stage is gonna have the
same IP address i'm going to be using

279
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,799
the same logic are over and over and
over again that whole goal this was

280
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,460
simply be able to store those payloads
into a database so that i can grab and

281
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:57,409
we use the maintainer water so the last
thing is simply infection types we do

282
00:23:57,409 --> 00:23:58,759
impressions types in just a second

283
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:03,830
so I before we do anything I need to
actually get a payload into the catalog

284
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,220
we're gonna start simple and we're going
to get a little more complex so the

285
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,549
first thing that we're going to add and
once again stop if you can't see the

286
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,668
first feel that we're going to add is
going to add just help

287
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:17,659
ok i'm a few fields here that are
optional really forever keeping purposes

288
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:21,230
the target i hate target board
description we're just going to call

289
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:27,200
this Cal see that juicy little type of
stray supports three people attacked

290
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,860
first one simple shelter man this is
going to be useful for something like I

291
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,840
you let your empire stager I you just
typed out directly to our your launcher

292
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,490
code this is going to use for fire and
shelter management of fire on the system

293
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,580
i do have to be a little careful by
escaping I trying to do as much of that

294
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,158
for years I can enjoy these last bits or
her sighs so we're going to use a joke

295
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:55,009
man and then are going to do help the
taxi the this is the the actual feel

296
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:57,950
that we're going to run so it was not
going to add to the catalog

297
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:03,980
ok so if we actually look at the catalog
nice decal if I close lucky strike and

298
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,490
reopen it and we go back to the catalog
and you see alice to it so once again .

299
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,399
of this reusability okay i want
everything to be stored so I could use

300
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:16,850
it over and over again so not only can
feel it in the catalog

301
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,860
i well it's let's create a new file
right so i go to file menu tonight I

302
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,668
just want to generate a new file right
now let's strike on the supports die so

303
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:30,769
less which is 97-2003 word documents
will come eventually but it's you know

304
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:35,389
we easier to stash payloads and excelled
in network so that's why i started so if

305
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:39,678
we just generally us right now you can
see you you have to add a table first

306
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,889
just because you're able to catalog it's
not going to take all your payloads and

307
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:43,789
thrown in there

308
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:49,279
because the goal is to eventually get
lots of palin catalog so first you have

309
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:56,239
to select the people that you want so
we're going to use cal- choose infection

310
00:25:56,239 --> 00:26:00,470
type every payload type whether it's a
showroom at powershell script or

311
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,869
actually has as multiple infections
hikes I they show man is basically just

312
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:10,070
running charitable and local time the
matrimonial cases questions the metadata

313
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,178
injection site will actually take that
command shove it into the metadata and

314
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:18,320
then use the macro to call metadata and
fire and so the infection types is

315
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,590
really the delivery mechanism and this
is where all the obvious vacation things

316
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,738
like better built into trying to form to
be so in this case was going to choose

317
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:32,840
simple show of man that go back up and
now we can actually create a file we're

318
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:40,039
going to generate a new xls ok so
success file say tues you have

319
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:44,119
established rate it creates able to
record for you and I just you know my

320
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,720
name is actually have a look at what's
right

321
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,440
hey loads ok blank spreadsheet open that
up and we'll contact his collar alex

322
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,330
gets up this is the simplest of attack

323
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,869
so the first one you know just it
creates on a woman you've always talked

324
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:07,970
name functioning really no obligation
except for this line so i was very

325
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:13,460
interesting i initially everything's
getting picked up by one header and and

326
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,729
I noticed that all you got to do in
order to fix Windows Defender so it

327
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:20,179
doesn't catching things just do
concatenation here on wscript.shell and

328
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,750
all that problem

329
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:28,570
thanks microsoft suite it so that it's
like the simplest example let's get some

330
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,300
little cupcake

331
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:42,010
ok let's put some more stuff into the
gap so let's add PS this is a powershell

332
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:56,379
script actually grab or isn't scary as
hell yea alright cool so you got one

333
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:04,090
calculator now all running calculus is
basically just start processing the

334
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,090
point being is that we're going to
demonstrate powershell is reality

335
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,550
ok so powerful place to set a very
important wanted to mention is that any

336
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,210
PS more scripts that you important to be
naughty and Cody let's try it will

337
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,120
encode as necessary based on the
infection that you choose

338
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,800
so if you're going to import powershell
script into the catalog DC component so

339
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:30,610
now look at that and let's uh let's
select that halo is our calendar we have

340
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,240
three infection text publishing screws
the first 17 but that's basically just

341
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,740
your go-to what happens in that in that
particular attack is that the the ps1

342
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:45,070
get a 64 encoded and then jammed into
cells and we can rebuild prior right

343
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,810
the second one on be 64 is exactly what
you think it is that the entire people

344
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:55,240
showed it to sell in plaintext I there
are things like if you have a i'm not

345
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,510
some heuristics that picking or tripping
on basics for quoting something like

346
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,410
that that's a good attack that and the
last one is truly evil know we'll talk

347
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:13,210
about that when you say so we have to
celebrate shows where did i do that i

348
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:25,000
get it and then let's create an ad it
loads

349
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:35,520
effective PG something so let's have a
look at this matter if it's a little

350
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,300
complicated so in this case going back
to install script everything is jammed

351
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,080
into the database in terms of color
blocks and the reason why did this is

352
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,550
because I there are some payloads that
are dependent on the same code blocks

353
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,520
like I might have five different
payloads any sort of those people that

354
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,400
depend on the same color blocks
wonderful usability I didn't want to

355
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,090
just to keep function methods and give
them different names because it's just

356
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,678
sloppy and let's let's not do that so I
insert into code blocks the code blocks

357
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,700
table is what contains all of the master
code and adventures going to powerful so

358
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:15,840
going back there I this is the function
actually just contains everything

359
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,100
starting at random name does exactly
what you think it does and then down

360
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,449
here we can you see this this is the
opposite of partial command basically

361
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:30,390
it's just power show Dashon wabash noni
dash window style hidden and here's the

362
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:39,090
actual dash i can see you grab that fire
out exactly backwards so I the way that

363
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:44,580
Lucky Strike knows how to or the way the
macro knows where the story is actually

364
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,590
kind of important because if you notice
when you actually open that spreadsheet

365
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,720
there's there's nothing there

366
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,470
it's not like i'm i'm jamming a load in
a one well what ends up happening is

367
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:00,690
that one cable gets added I when you
select the payload to use Lucky Strike

368
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:05,250
creates a legend strength and so this is
the start row this is the end row and

369
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,940
this column where the payment is
actually hiding and I do this like

370
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,590
starting over in column 100 starting
down on row thousand so you just hard

371
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,699
not to see it too even if you're using a
template xls file chance are not going

372
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,700
to overwrite that's that attack

373
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:30,550
let's do it

374
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:36,610
good going out before it's born right no
one cares about standard and attack so

375
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:43,929
let's let's select that kayla is on kelp
and then let's see the encrypted and

376
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:48,880
attack so we do the encrypted attack
this attack was designed specifically

377
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,060
for sandbox patient so what others are
having you but I you create your fancy

378
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,330
shiny payload you said it off to your
customer you get a bunch of shelves two

379
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,830
hours later you get a shelf John and
John's pc like what the heck is going on

380
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,949
the first time is having me i was like
with josh mike ok let's interact and

381
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:10,390
she'll die like what is well we lost
their opposition by ourselves or some

382
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,040
other 86 degrees

383
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,700
you know company is going to take your
loads gonna run into terminus malware

384
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,170
and it sees the show format for now your
payload is flat as being malicious and

385
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:24,790
you can use that you're taking right i
wanna i wanna i want to use my playlist

386
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:30,790
so the one with the encrypted attack
guys is I you should know the target you

387
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:35,740
want to fish so let's say I want to fish
company i'm like this bother people .

388
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:41,770
okay now I know what that means is you
start roasting your ecard you know the

389
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:47,470
domains so the the way this particular
tag works is that once the macro lands

390
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,700
and gets fired

391
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,000
there's a function there that will call
out to active directory retrieve the

392
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,500
user's email address for Active
Directory the mail attribute split off

393
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,360
the end tag which should match what you
put in and then if that works it'll be

394
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,860
decrypted and it'll run that's actually
what this evil court haha good so we

395
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,610
have a loaded let's create file

396
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:21,070
that's ecology something something ok so
we open about your file enable content

397
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:24,970
was going to spend spend spend spend
spend name is your error and the reason

398
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,940
we're going to see an error is because
my machine is not George domain so this

399
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,390
is actually simulating what would happen
if I already better that was actually

400
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,110
trying to do analysis on this file
you're going to see something specified

401
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:40,299
domain there does not exist you cannot
be contacted and then stops . so we can

402
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:45,429
actually go into this this is a function
of the e/m function right here is what

403
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:49,929
retrieve the email address that string
that I put into lucky strike people calm

404
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:54,940
is the encryption key and what happens
is that lucky strike will rc4 encrypt

405
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:01,330
the payload with that key and then once
the macro fires down here bunch of other

406
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,980
naughtiest what happens is that the
macro code right here will call out

407
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,659
after directory called function p.m. it
will get the email address and then

408
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:15,550
right here is the call to actually do
the decription will decrypt it will tend

409
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:21,609
to decrypt the payload using the smtp
domain of the user so you are targeting

410
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:26,589
main user with the knowledge that they
probably have read access to active

411
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:29,349
directory there authenticated users are
going to go out retrieve the mail

412
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:33,550
attribute which is what this card's what
he uses my fault split-off string and

413
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,570
hopefully using the same domain that you
put in its gonna attempt to decrypt so

414
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:43,030
in this case I'm just going to kind of
hijackthis people 4.com because that's

415
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,770
what that function would have returned

416
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:50,679
everyone follow me so far racquet and
then your God fingers crossed from the

417
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,679
background

418
00:34:54,589 --> 00:35:01,609
secret and can't wait to do that one
next let's get into i was going to some

419
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:13,249
SC let's add it was the catalog but they
had parties just just cause you look

420
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:23,419
like a loans not easy

421
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:29,029
well it sure doesn't look so why should
take the executable provider a basis for

422
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:36,440
divider right next to Pat the sequel
Davis so actually is also now we've got

423
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:43,819
that lets select that people and now you
have a different set of infection to

424
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:47,180
have the surgery to attaching that which
is based on macrumors outstanding work

425
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:52,489
45 mins you can actually take basically
for code file use the Microsoft based

426
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:57,799
actual science for detail . yosi ID code
file to a binary and then run the binary

427
00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:01,700
watch demonstrate that now save disk
that's exactly what you think it does it

428
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,029
save the extra distance fire safety and
then reflected p

429
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:12,170
that's what we'll notice we don't take
it so seriously ill we got that and then

430
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:24,109
let's actually generate your file
straight heroes or something something

431
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:32,269
so you still generally takes awhile to
revamp our file 53 compile but its fire

432
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:40,758
going into that this is the actual code
just a little bit of obfuscation here I

433
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:44,599
don't know any others that are looking
for certificates macro heart has

434
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,940
automatically really honestly no one
does that

435
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,009
so then here's the here's the
obfuscation called actually run the

436
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:55,269
military so in case you're wondering
where the people short

437
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:59,919
well the pails our store in appdata
roaming our shop at an XC some of you

438
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:04,598
interpret this happens well I I block
excuse for making fire from attic have

439
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,859
something for you

440
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:15,939
actually he's okay i'm familiar with
invoke that the intention okay that is

441
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:20,828
so what about the projection is designed
as a script that matter put out as part

442
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:24,519
of our sport and what it does is it
allows you to be inviting rate and it

443
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:28,328
opens up a section of memory and fires
that vibrates the section of memory now

444
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:32,259
it's awesome but that is that you can
generally fired both the projection so

445
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:37,749
long as you're executable support is our
debt I you can take that executable and

446
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:42,609
loaded directly into member without ever
having to write an extra voltage which I

447
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:49,299
thought was just totally sexy pregnant
so I so we started to bed that attack

448
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:58,029
let you look at what we do that let's
let's put something else catalog

449
00:37:58,029 --> 00:38:05,259
everyone say so ok alright we're going
to add people to see my lap to the

450
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:21,369
catalog is an executable is from
actually and then let's create a file

451
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:28,359
alright so we have our most people now I
want you to pay attention this directory

452
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:32,558
this is basically we're like stretches
drop stuff okay Roman saw that is now

453
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:37,419
you saw before that the SQ Bozek street
. c was actually created to that

454
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:41,138
directory and fire if this goes right
what you're going to see here is not an

455
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:44,859
executable that gets right into text
files i want to talk about those files

456
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:52,569
the minute that you select a reflective
p eventually

457
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,400
able to add no I didn't choose that prob

458
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:07,400
hello select Fela people that I see and
then we choose the reflective type is on

459
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,229
is the executable 64-bit was not an easy
architecture for the actual original

460
00:39:12,229 --> 00:39:14,868
flight are you with every count

461
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:20,960
yes I I don't then just a little sore so
you can actually see the payload pop to

462
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,719
get out in the properties on get up by
the reason why I include that that we

463
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:34,339
actually see the executable pop to the
screen otherwise ok so now that we have

464
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:36,950
that payload add it

465
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:51,259
let's create the file across something

466
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:58,249
ok let's again pay attention this
directory if everything works like a

467
00:39:58,249 --> 00:40:01,459
single see to text files get rid of that
you'll see a single population to talk

468
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:13,940
to this all my housework so they're so
there's the executable easy to text

469
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,960
files this first txt file is basically
four encoded representation of involved

470
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,249
want to be judged

471
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:25,488
ok so and second txt file is the actual
executable just basic support so i said

472
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,769
if you're blocking is being run from a
data

473
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:33,140
well I'm ready txt files to a figure
which is standard procedure was actually

474
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:41,450
shut that down and take a look at what's
happened to download I know it will

475
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,359
start questions does need to download
anything from the internet know we're

476
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:49,038
invading payloads I into a spreadsheet
now the only time that called happen to

477
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:53,329
you a lot of the internet is if your
payload use pager or if you're heading

478
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:55,400
like see to it

479
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,960
but the whole point of this is to invent
payloads not just had a download string

480
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,549
unless that's what you want your paper
look so there's only one is right here

481
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:05,480
you can see you

482
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,369
I tried my best to heavily obfuscate
this i basically what's happening is

483
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:14,029
that we're running powershell based on
the architecture of the executable

484
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:17,990
because that's important and then down
here we actually we're writing the text

485
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:23,899
files I to updated and cadmium sorry
we're doing the content to bring those

486
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,410
texts falls back into memory and then
fire them out if you just try to do this

487
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:32,629
all from memory in the macro well XL
cubes and it makes you so i had to

488
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:35,930
actually write something to this is not
hundreds of objects sake but like I said

489
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,700
no is it will be great

490
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,160
that's already that's wonderful with
this pen testers you're going to want

491
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,170
shells and that's what i want so I
another main driver behind lucky strike

492
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,059
was the fact that we wanted to be able
to run multiple payloads I met multiple

493
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:55,369
payloads of multiple infection types
into a template xls that's exactly we're

494
00:41:55,369 --> 00:42:03,529
going to let's add two more to the
catalog i have a standard is executable

495
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:16,369
and this is just something that I don't
use names have been to create value T

496
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:26,180
and we're going to add policy Empire and
then let's put our water code in there

497
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:35,839
launcher is one remember launcher decody
ok so when you do your your launcher

498
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,920
boat you need to take that be sports
train decoded and they bring it looks

499
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,920
straight I so baller

500
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:53,700
now let's actually select them i'm going
to select the MSFA LOL be executable and

501
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,890
we're going to do a standard safety disk

502
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,730
fortunately he looks at my second
generation our work with reflective

503
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:07,080
injection it's not yet and we're going
to take our Empire once we get that ok

504
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:15,840
so now i have those people selected have
a template but you're separated standard

505
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,990
template click enable cons that
basically just pop the calendar

506
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,109
this is one of our fishing techniques we
decided we better than audience and

507
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:26,310
there and we say hey we changed vacation
and everything to cancel i was that we

508
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:36,480
support for specific management shot so
merry christmas merry christmas so what

509
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,230
about his attention to that there is
already a coding in here and the whole

510
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,100
one of the major is my lucky stars that
we wanted to be able to take a template

511
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:56,279
that already had a girl in it and in bed
our naughtiness into that mac so let's

512
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:04,290
do that we're going to choose from the
final offer we're going to update

513
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:10,380
existing that's a lot to the passage to
see us make sure nothing is

514
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,150
password-protected wire

515
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:21,000
wait so is probably going to get a
warning here to replace this we do and a

516
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,250
double check ur 15 so however feeling so
over here

517
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:39,598
security is great it's my way over here
I have two terminals 1 has an empire set

518
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:48,809
it has a nice butt doesn't have been
helping his words so we greater payload

519
00:44:48,809 --> 00:45:03,450
infected your template 80-something
words your template enable contact magic

520
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,410
happen

521
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:13,890
bob is what our character our corner or
recreational area director of sports

522
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:20,578
section down here and reception counter
opens she's nothing

523
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:29,099
pop goes about making money seasoned
sales or whatever that was the whole

524
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:41,910
point behind it like I say all the
massive hug here Cal are all available

525
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:48,118
stone catalog so 12 goals go behind this
was you can take that LSD file syncing

526
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:53,339
forget have the rescue team pull it down
and everyone has access so that includes

527
00:45:53,339 --> 00:46:03,630
that question about mr. day so the
question was a template to the catalog

528
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:08,490
of that the very next feature that honor
ways I was like I was like reach going

529
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,399
this last night like I can do we have to
do it now

530
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,589
now I I couldn't do it so I wanted to do
though is in the just it's just a

531
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:23,430
satisfied i have a table are created in
the database called template so it's

532
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,868
everything is already prepped for is
just not so it's a great help

533
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,600
good question it's all dependent on your
payload if you embed a massive

534
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,529
executable you're going to get a
spreadsheet so that our script is gonna

535
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,670
be smaller

536
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:47,890
mr. like really question no I'm not
doing cleanup because i'm lazy like that

537
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:52,600
I thought about melting all this way and
that's definitely something for you

538
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,310
should remember right now don't think
it's being up so it's based on up

539
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,360
yeah

540
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:47,770
I get it was so high 60 is still does
not work like walking further right

541
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:48,340
right

542
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,640
awesome yes

543
00:47:51,640 --> 00:48:05,259
so really a question for you to find 100
degrees artist wants to my general

544
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,810
public audience

545
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,890
oh yeah

546
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:26,788
surreal and rise like about time to take
eventually work for nobody but chu and

547
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:45,630
got my going-away dress like that yeah

548
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,740
ly very well

549
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,660
we like that

550
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,920
right dad

551
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:13,319
it's pretty good yeah like i like what
you guys have like shit i'm gonna shit

552
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:22,470
so my teri writers like to wear clean up
rap makes it 10 * actual get voted in

553
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:36,359
turn out pretty much there that we're
coming together out of here quick

554
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:45,690
yeah it was like I was walking back next
probably do is they have my slide

555
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:55,620
freaking are able to get you all need a
lot of real estate longer slide out

556
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,940
already think we should kiss you're on
the slide left on us at least the end

557
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,440
you might switch we actually really i
don't know we'll find out i just kind of

558
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,460
my hope spirits show right

559
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:16,260
yeah to get on and chips that little

560
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:27,799
they're flying that they're like
everyone's what idea so they're not

561
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:37,610
flashing everyone slowly year's best way
would be off too much involved remember

562
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:44,930
is that the word is with my
co-conspirators doing this whole target

563
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:47,930
out the slides not be as much fun

564
00:50:49,220 --> 00:51:04,790
there's 11 down other words I don't
think

565
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:12,190

566
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:20,740

567
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,470
go back remember

568
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:35,779
to see the manager said that right there
too right over there and her doesn't

569
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:44,270
like I can't handle the interrupt one
and a single and I win another tree

570
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:51,140
errand

571
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:55,500
yeah

572
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:35,970
around the world is a lot like myself in
a situation where all your stuff

573
00:52:44,239 --> 00:53:04,489
and local content structure structure
things together for the audio streams

574
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:13,339
30

575
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:47,069
