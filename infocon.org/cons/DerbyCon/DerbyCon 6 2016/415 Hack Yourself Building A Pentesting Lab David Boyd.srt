1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,770
is going to get started here in order to
God I was a rolling stone yet every year

2
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:25,140
actually investigated so it's like it's
hacked yourself building and testing lab

3
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,570
from the Prophet time came out a couple
different things i had several customers

4
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:38,040
ask me how did you do that can you show
me but I do to us again I had a summer

5
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,989
coworkers or friends over to go I want
to do what you do but i don't know how

6
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,529
to get started so I don't have a little
lap well how do you do that there's not

7
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,460
there's no youtube videos and all sorts
of stuff there's not just kind of a

8
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,670
ground-level how to sew this is kind of
what this talk about so several years

9
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,640
ago there are family we're going on a
bear your solve rate and as he was

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,840
writing a war he said these words six
hours to chop down a tree and i will

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,970
spend the first for sharpening the axe

12
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:16,320
I don't know if that's necessarily true
story of a nice time also had a great

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,339
quote that's really is this talk he said
any bull came out with the point is to

14
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:28,380
understand so in our field especially we
can know how to do stuff for the real

15
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,750
like the real gumption of it is to
understand why does we're doing it and

16
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,549
why does you know what happened things
work with a work just as good ball

17
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:39,329
sitting pretty

18
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,130
my name is it boy pentester routine for
sexual security solution i've worked in

19
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,789
every field from spend some time in the
Army when i get out 120 some retail IT

20
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,140
work for the government for a wild
finance media energy sector i finally

21
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,570
got tired of sitting in the hot air and
cubicles decided and salting i am a

22
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,589
christian which means that i'm just a
sinner saved by grace I have a husband

23
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,020
I'm a holler of that kind of all right
there huge you get a big game

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,080
and you guys remember the shell-shocked
homebuilding from you know what a while

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,870
back right so that came up with a new
vulnerability called diaper shock or

26
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:34,950
maybe it's the chocolate people I just
quick note here about half of cherry you

27
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,579
guys seen the shirts you guys were a
couple speakers talking about him

and please do i mean really is really

30
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,010
they provide education there's a
training center classroom to go through

it out pull your arms bracelets and
stuff

34
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,059
the agenda for today we're gonna figure
out that the wider city of alive and how

35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,560
i'm going to talk about some pension
contributions that are out there some of

36
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,730
the various mobiums you can find out
while I'm gonna give you just kind of a

37
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,109
broader review some recommended tools to
get started playing with i'm going to

38
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,840
short enough and I've got a nice little
and going to want so let's take a poll

39
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,650
if you don't mind Richard and who here
works better by reading about so nobody

40
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:38,010
loves worry about it and a couple people
and who he learns better by by the

41
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,709
hands-on HR okay yeah there's a lot more
folks there right it is it's nothing

42
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,770
against you know put guys either but
especially in our industry never

43
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,040
experienced anything like there's no
better way

44
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,250
read books and eBooks great i've got
some recommendations at the end there's

45
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,250
no better way of actually learning into
my duty

46
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,430
so what is that hacking life and
somebody came back today it's nothing

47
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,440
more than just a place that replicates a
real world network it's just a virtual

48
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,680
sandbox to play in

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,389
completely cut off from the outside
world let's do your tools and do things

50
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:24,350
into so why do you need to build a lab
well to get good we all need to get

51
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,030
better ever with you

52
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,880
the bad guys are getting better so we
need to get better right couple reasons

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,759
skillset bereavement you tried something
new so we're here at derby car we're

54
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,199
seeing all these goals come and see all
these gold stocks and I really want to

55
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,229
try that thing out that he did but I
don't have a place to do it

56
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,520
go home fire up your lab download that
new totally just don't try their

57
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:57,530
commercial on tactics so if you have
been in IT your network security for a

58
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,849
while maybe . maybe you're not
management you know project management

59
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:04,969
maybe you're not doing that but you know
the pen testing stuff anymore

60
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,110
this lets you and me go back like
writing my school comes back to get such

61
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,770
a go-bag trying to brush up on some deal
tactics you know so that we can kind of

62
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,169
stick fresh my brother proof-of-concept
that's great for customers so if you're

63
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:22,280
in a sales mode or you're just trying to
find ways that contract or something

64
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,448
we need something we need to know you
know what it is you do this is great

65
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:30,530
this is a you know we done with this all
time for customers will throw the webex

66
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,400
we'll throw our lab and will say hey you
know this is just a very simple

67
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,210
penetration testing attack that can
happen on your network you know in

68
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,770
theory and nine times out of ten that
seals the deal if any customers ever any

69
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,080
questions with 800 defense blows that
stuff right and then I'm hoping shirt

70
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,039
demonstrations very hard so these guys
pieces

71
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,150
step up here and far smarter than me
none of these tools they're doing

72
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:04,159
packing one so little bit of side story
here some CISOs when there's a parent s

73
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:08,150
going on are you tell them hey we need
to have a pen test you know this is the

74
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,719
80 yeah it's fine everything's on fire
and barns on fire on fire right

75
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,250
write some songs which they had this
love you mentioned anything

76
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,570
security-related or there's a blip on
the network they wish they had tax shut

77
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,700
out everything Killswitch kill it all
right ahead lab can help i've noticed

78
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,830
pussies some of the questions that some
of the other level management has about

79
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:36,330
what does it security testing tail and
above all else

80
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:46,020
don't be a script kidding think that man

81
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,340
so here's my well anybody really

82
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,539
Red Team Blue Team guys any kind of IT
personnel if you're not in bed texting

83
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,980
you're not in security if you're just a
network guy just having you know go

84
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,320
build a lab to build lab at home

85
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,310
ask your upper management to build a lab
in your environment recreate your

86
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,060
environment so that you can troubleshoot
problems you're having put on their

87
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,530
c-level executives will see the PT looks
like this is really easy to do if you

88
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,210
are some kind of see little guy and
you're in charge of the technical team

89
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,909
you need to know that I'm 15 does really
truly I'm you know I'm not be much here

90
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,810
but you need to know what they do need
to have a general understanding with you

91
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,440
and you need to be able to kind of do a
little bit of yourself here it's gonna

92
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,190
make you more effective leader and it's
going to be more effective for customers

93
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,130
and it's going to baltimore spectra team
so just just about that students any

94
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,380
kind of students you know if you're in
some kind of a college for something on

95
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:53,310
fire blood and then anyone want to learn
the skill so well this talk is more

96
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,520
focused on the red team side of the
house

97
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,130
a DA 67 on Twitter actually did release
a huge like hundred thirty-five page PDF

98
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:09,719
i'm setting up a clap for blue team and
its really in-depth talk about ideas

99
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,760
ideas you know all sorts of stuff some
final things so if you want to get into

100
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,950
that follow him on twitter finest is
brian joy right now he's got working on

101
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,740
that although you know

102
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Michael's you guys so what you need to
go ahead lab while you need about you

103
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,039
know 5,000 service on amazon cloud right
back in the day you need a second

104
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,218
service like that and actually this
could have been my bedroom few years ago

105
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:43,800
status servers monitors in like manner
because it's kind of hard to really

106
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,279
build a decent lab back then because we
didn't have as well

107
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:55,320
virtualization now with the advent of
vmware vmware fusion and virtualbox and

108
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,120
things like that you can literally build
a lab on your last time that works

109
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,240
giving you more on the Shelf laptop like
bestbuy or something

110
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,390
obviously the more power you throw at it
better be that your second but really

111
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,560
only use a laptop you need some kind of
virtualization software works in vmware

112
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,790
being boxed on like that you need a
couple of a vulnerable districts to

113
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:28,349
practice on their laptops when you come
back just kind of generals you know

114
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:34,740
broad specifications for decent lab like
on your laptop you just need like a

115
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,410
high-five you know quad-core you can get
by with our three what you're going to

116
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,969
get a little bit of chalk there so you
know trying to get at least 5 16 gigs of

117
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:51,510
ram each VM that you fire up some of the
ones that aren't as graphics video

118
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,579
incredible things can get away with just
putting you know half of you know happy

119
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:01,829
gave or whatever in their midst of the
other ones like server 2012 you want to

120
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:05,880
put at least 24 games so you know that
16 gig gives you kind of a nice little

121
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,829
to play with so you don't get choked up
too much and then obviously very hard

122
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:15,329
drive space to carry all these p.m.
because they are still come big so you

123
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,920
need at least 250 more cargo space you
have the more games you

124
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:27,319
thank you no more species so the
building your hand clap step one you

125
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:34,370
just need a file or write all of the
vmas out there that i know of anyways

126
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,899
are set up in some kind of zip format
right seeing something like you know for

127
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:43,399
windows you have winrar or 7zip I think
wins it might still be out there you'll

128
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,949
need to file their free go online
download you know which one I like when

129
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,359
rock but get that

130
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:58,880
hey is that three days think seven is
also good for managers you have kita or

131
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,680
the other however I think he does like
99 size but it's great you can zip and

132
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,370
unzip and choose the you know format
that you want in download and install

133
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,690
that you know

134
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:19,730
step two step to install your wizard
step to go out and get some

135
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,680
virtualization software so for pc users
couple of free options you have vmware

136
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,160
player kind of stand-alone
out-of-the-box works well you also

137
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,149
virtualbox again free standing on a box
works well pretty easy to install

138
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,750
you also have some paint versions
unfortunate for Mac users we only get a

139
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,339
30 day free trial of the more fusion
which is the mac version of the player

140
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,600
and for pc users workstation fire

141
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:56,959
the only difference between the paid and
free really is ability to take snapshots

142
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,469
so if you're building these im's and
you're getting all fired up

143
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,790
you're getting them all working the you
take a snapshot of what you get it

144
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,699
working and then if you crash it you
those that you found this cool exploit

145
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:13,189
actually knocked everything off line and
you just can't recover your password you

146
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:19,550
can refer back to that snapshot come
back to life right so you've got your

147
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,930
honor hiber you've got your
virtualization software

148
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,769
step 3 you need a pen testing this truck
there's several of them out there

149
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:34,089
you do what you want you know pick what
you like

150
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:39,310
I liked Alex but there's also been two
years back box

151
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,910
what about testing their samurai WTF for
utility hacking their samurai STFU i

152
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,329
think it's going to be referred to the
control things platform but not sure

153
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:53,469
what's going on that and then just
forensics working to depth links for

154
00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:00,339
friends bday have like whooping some wax
then moved on and you have backtrack for

155
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:06,910
a while anything else tally so my heart
is another option yeah I have a personal

156
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:13,540
but that's another option but there's
also additional or if you really want to

157
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,660
go out and build your own download it
you know

158
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,790
unix flavor of your choice enforcement
tools like if that's you know that's

159
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,079
your thing that's a challenge that you
want to go for a lot of a lot of folks

160
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:33,729
that i no hold on districts I don't use
it as a totally unrelated side note you

161
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,730
guys know there's a lot of really bad
crap going on right now

162
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,620
yeah I mean it's you know i'm tired of
seeing on the news if we can all find a

163
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,689
way to be as happy kids that picture i
think the world would be a much better

164
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:51,250
place and then that takes dumping legos
on the world my life for ya

165
00:13:51,250 --> 00:14:02,230
it would take a lot of layers but you
know it again I'm related you guys chose

166
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,730
to be here and I sincerely appreciate

thank you guys seriously things okay

175
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:55,280
huh tripped up a little bit alright so
this is a question that I had as i was

176
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,199
developing this is that ok so we've got
a lot on our fiber I've got my

177
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,160
virtualization software not too
comfortable you know rolling my eyes so

178
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,750
we're trying to download myself the kind
folks over at offensive security have

179
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:15,020
precompiled linux distros that you
control a box right so where are the one

180
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:23,449
stolen so we put a little video is going
to cali go work the go to your downloads

181
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:28,580
page click download kali linux right
you've got is there if you want to try

182
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:35,210
to hold your own so you can also for
them know that you're sure thing got a

183
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:40,430
weekly builds and they've also got
rebuilt Kali Linux VM ware and

184
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,410
virtualbox pages you just click that
link the bottom where it will take you

185
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,709
to the offensive security side these are
you know owned and operated maintain my

186
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:55,460
phone security but totally free and then
literally you can choose vmware or

187
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:03,080
virtualbox images easy to download just
click them and started down the radio

188
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,130
redbox know crazy setup for anything
needed at the most you might want to

189
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:16,370
change the password use default
passwords you can i've noticed there's a

190
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:21,980
lot of choked with that and some of the
older bm's USB 3.1 there's not a lot of

191
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:28,400
love there so you can if you can get it
to work right now i have run off just

192
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,550
you know own hard drive that's all
laptop had a hole where I storm all and

193
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,709
it's good

194
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:43,640
actually yes i will definitely miss
Longley and uh going to be possibly

195
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,720
running a blog that's a little more
in-depth I did it so be on the lookout

196
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,330
for that reason Wright has issues

197
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,850
yes you might want to generate your ssh
keys because a especially the pre-built

198
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:02,330
from insecurity comes with
self-regenerating say once you

199
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,160
distracted it installed it will be a vmx
file in the mole on the chin strap

200
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,640
double-click that vmx file it will pull
up your vm player your virtual piano

201
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,170
player of some swords and an enviable
we're asking you know that your copies

202
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:24,290
of humidity just say I copied it a few
seconds you gotta log entry was always

203
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:30,649
act as it's really easy right so you got
your on our I've got your virtualization

204
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,060
software now you've got your position
just remaining something to attack right

205
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:45,919
there are several probably hundreds of
vulnerable vm that are out there right

206
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,190
there is an affordable this morning
catch to learn fishing there's the wasp

207
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,000
broken web apps for web applications
there's also let go

208
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:02,090
there's a website home.com that hosts a
lot of different you know like challenge

209
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,470
games and things like that it has like
got tricks and manpower less and

210
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,040
different things like that it's more
geared towards beginner I like an

211
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,500
affordable because it's a it's
intentionally vulnerable version with a

212
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,650
bunch of links it has remote logins
backdoors mobile web services facility

213
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,100
built in default password to get all
kinds of stuff so you can literally just

214
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:32,480
run whatever you want to go crazy buddy
with a lot of these vulnerable dm's

215
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,230
right actually had a question on the
whole life but they don't want to do

216
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,950
with it

217
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,550
there are guides out there written by
some developers right

218
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,090
rapid7 that we got from an exploitable
written by a she wanted

219
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,860
I believe it gives you a cool little
step by step you know here's some cool

220
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,379
things you can do right kind of cheat
but if you feel like you need to follow

221
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,370
along with the guys that's ok everybody
has to start somewhere to go ahead and

222
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,739
grab the morning catch has a great start
of God as well if you want fishing

223
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,740
download your fishing server choice

224
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,520
download morning catch-and-shoot guys
it's an actual real working busy

225
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,379
environment there's also a white paper
and up on utility if you're wanting to

226
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,980
practice with that hacking when you get
better at you know sequel injection

227
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,789
cross-site scripting stuff like that
there's a whole bunch of different items

228
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:32,919
and sands also going to read up on using
mozilla mother unintentional but don't

229
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:40,179
PM that are out there with XP Windows XP
is still floating around out there still

230
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,740
floating around $TIME customer sites i
kiii lost out this year the number of

231
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,799
sites i've been to that still had active
ones XP machines right don't have

232
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,149
windows XP in your machines guys
sections don't ride while it's still out

233
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:58,059
there go ahead and practice on it
because it's really easy it's easy to

234
00:19:58,059 --> 00:19:58,928
break

235
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:04,510
it's fun ok it's out their windows
server 2012 i want to challenge you to

236
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,840
build your own domain and you know it
takes a few minutes a little bit

237
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,580
challenging but there's right how to do
that you can also get exchange or win7

238
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,908
microsoft has made several needs
available for free on a trial basis so

239
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:27,789
you can download is from a service like
technically the developer ridge you can

240
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,090
download these evaluations and they even
tell you hey go ahead and take a

241
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,949
snapshot of this so that you refer back
to it because it's the evaluation so you

242
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:41,500
know they're they're all for that your
heart for free and and go crazy like

243
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:48,860
segment has take that has a certain
valuations the developer studio has much

244
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,059
virtual machines for ye right now and
things like that so you guys 127

245
00:20:53,059 --> 00:21:01,520
district like why there's the websites
for the vm you want to go you know what

246
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:11,179
form and then totally unrelated but I
was doing this talk i found this is is

247
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,809
is my r4 million people watching

248
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:26,480
so as you're sitting out all these what
does it say it says the windows XP

249
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:34,910
startup sound slowed down to 24 hours
and it has a as of last night and had

250
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:40,400
over four million views myself and I
actually listened to some of it we still

251
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:52,820
got 20 bar and just slow down low pitch
slipping inches more and scream as a

252
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,840
side note as you're downloading and
installing all these beings as you're

253
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,879
getting them set up

254
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,540
do not expose them to the internets do
not expose all Williams the area if you

255
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,399
expose one will use the internet you're
gonna have a bad time you go out there

256
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,510
and get it on patch on his XP machine
and you throw it on your network and you

257
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,350
just go crazy

258
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:22,070
forget to make it hosts only you're
gonna have a bad time today you've got

259
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:28,549
the environment you've got a place to
play got so much room for activities and

260
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,168
now I can start hacking right wall

261
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:36,650
ok of what tools to use others thousand
tools built any happened thousands

262
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,370
groups of release to places like 30
comment def Comedy sides and things like

263
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:46,309
that so this is just going to general
recommendations will start gettin map

264
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,059
any good hydration has starts with
promises you want to do some processes

265
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:55,850
with like a map from a scam right look
for open-source verticals the kind folks

266
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,500
over temple what you have

267
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,110
version s is called mrs. home that is
free for 220 easily so you can run a

268
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:09,830
full mobility stand against your test
Network and start looking at more

269
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:15,139
abilities and results right around there
Kane just a few weeks ago I had a

270
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,190
customer come for they saw an apple with
a whole bunch of clear text or Angeles

271
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,690
to get that so I ran into a volcano and
he literally stood up should be setting

272
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,170
a cane is that stuff it still works

273
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:36,410
yeah it's it's it is very little it
still works great it works great in all

274
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,100
environments and i've tested you still
get credentials and that's because

275
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,500
you're still want to play they're very
click happy to go practice with painting

276
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,790
to do some are poison attacks please and
are more important / 44 you're going to

277
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,320
take off some network last month
responder is also great for you guys

278
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,320
heard that spoken of a few times that's
right man middle-of-the-road wp8 up that

279
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,740
file so you can practice this man
middlesex with that could get those

280
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,450
yummy hatches from users once you get
all those hashes need something to crack

281
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,610
them with so i recommend practicing was
only John or hash cat copy the hatches

282
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,719
to a text file run John cracker see what
you get

283
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,580
there's couple versions best one out
there there's a community edition which

284
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,649
is free and paid attention witches

285
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,780
hey but its built-in how it's built into
several these pentesting describes and

286
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:36,410
free room works for you have plenty of
exploits 27 practice on for social

287
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:43,310
engineering you've got a set the bar
very own dating goldfish SPF fish means

288
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,790
there's a thousand different fishing and
social engineering tools out there

289
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:53,659
they're all you must never free i said
efficiency for free so fire up that

290
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:59,060
fishing box start practicing sufficient
acts figure out the best email layout

291
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,690
that you

292
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,409
that you like that you know works it
looks good and I can really pull the

293
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:06,950
users start kind of fine-tuning that I
see a lot of phishing attacks fail

294
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:14,210
because you know the email didn't look
at that tape or it looks too real or you

295
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,750
know just something to something was off
right you want to do you want to make

296
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,570
the user as comfortable as they can as
they're going about their day-to-day

297
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,320
business and they should see this email
that says it's a dress with nature and I

298
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,570
go oh yeah I'll do that click and then
you're in for open-source

299
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,279
intelligence-gathering again thousands
of other tools out there i really like

300
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:39,230
the scriptures were written by the part
where I really the same is it is

301
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,830
absolutely fantastic it will just pull
every bit of the source data you can

302
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:49,639
from website spit on a nice HTML file
let you read this great reconnaissance

303
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:54,139
also great information for the customer
if they've got a couple domains out

304
00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:58,399
there and there's somebody set up a you
know possible pitching tag just want to

305
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,899
go to demand that looks like them

306
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:05,449
this will pull it and you can look at it
and say hey you know googled up column

307
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,200
with two lands has been you know
squatting for a while that you guys are

308
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,120
do you want to investigate that another
great tool for potential scripting is

309
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,939
powerful Empire for impartial scripts
and things like that you talk about this

310
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,509
weekend

311
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:27,230
I mean it is blows me away that this and
then program exact as post exploitation

312
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,539
framework it's really easy to use it's
really easy to set up and install and

313
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:37,908
you can run parallel strips with it as
well as the reconnaissance all sorts of

314
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:42,590
stuff to be good a hole-in-one utility
belt located i really like it and

315
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,549
they're probably better ways of doing
things there's a thousand tools out

316
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:49,940
there is just an example of a handful
something i like the values that I

317
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:57,230
reckon that's an optional as you're
building at your lab try to build a

318
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:02,960
domain so go out universal service .
well build a main controller add a bunch

319
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,159
of users to make it as realistic
environment as you can little challenge

320
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:11,480
but you know nothing we can't handle
right Peter came too quick right

321
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:17,030
on his watch like romantic comedies and
he's got a you know a nice little

322
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,720
write-up about how to build a tremendous
event so you figured out how to go out

323
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,280
and get install it

324
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:28,250
here's how to build it up once you get
it all figured out

325
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,630
once you get it all installed once you
said everything is host calling you want

326
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:42,230
to make sure that it all works right to
go through and while all what i'm doing

327
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,210
here is i'm just checking them all my vm
our sites have those stolen they are

328
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,250
completely separated from the internet

329
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:55,130
everything is offline it's all whose and
housed within my home system here and

330
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:00,380
then you go on your attacker platform
you just want to ping all your systems

331
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,070
make sure that up and are working and
you know make sure you talk to him so

332
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:08,389
that's just be paying thrills make sure
they weren't make sure they all talk

333
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:14,480
yeah you don't want to throw a timeout
and then Amanda you know games on our

334
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:24,740
team is not working for stop talking so
well-seasoned worse

335
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:32,690
cool it all works congratulations you
have been working out what

336
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:42,800
self-contained working out right so all
goes well i'm going to show you guys my

337
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:56,419
hand right let's see--let's worse so
this is my hacking on this is wayne

338
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,530
enterprises

339
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,980
I've got only one xbox one that's my
type of machine

340
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,720
I've got the goldfish morning catch
fishing server

341
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,530
I've got a windows XP box I've gotten
this little too i've built in the main

342
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,450
controller with windows server 2012

343
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,750
we've got another attack platform
several tools are only available on

344
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,850
windows are available

345
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:25,189
so it's good to have you know a woman
inside the box out there so i'm gonna

346
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,309
guess you're just a really quick
penetration test this is something that

347
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:32,480
I've done the customer site and it went
almost exactly like bits right

348
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:48,410
login using your parentals so you IM and
get right easier

349
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,659
you're typing the change-up and we see
what's open our windows XP box for

350
00:29:53,659 --> 00:30:00,200
instance right so you just want to put a
match can see that video was pretty

351
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,919
quick scan what it's like to be boxy was
a pretend like we don't know it's 160

352
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:17,690
hours but this is where having a little
more memory on your host machine allows

353
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,080
you to run these things a little bit
better so remember you have blessed

354
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:29,090
model you're going to get a list going
to tote up and it's great so in looking

355
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:36,830
okay well you've got to tell me dope in
the looks like a 32 rndv there so you

356
00:30:36,830 --> 00:31:07,639
know maybe windows box bushes still
check here make sure it is a windows XP

357
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,870
box

358
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:13,010
how about that right there is xB
pressure ulcers back two or possibly

359
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:20,990
with a service doesn't vary so we know
that it is XP unpatched was highly

360
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:25,820
vulnerable to insulate itself so this is
where we can load up

361
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:38,619
mostly just load it up with a mess up
council will take second round to the

362
00:31:38,619 --> 00:31:42,759
denver consoles as assistants living so
first step into our reconnaissance we

363
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:46,929
found a ball machine is XP on it check
it out

364
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:51,998
despite several something I wanted this
guy so we're going to just do a search

365
00:31:51,999 --> 00:32:14,079
for MS and 08 example promises gets more
exciting

366
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:24,099
alright just use that exploit their
decision to use copy paste now you're

367
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:27,519
loaded up so you've loaded up that
exploit your prepared for attack

368
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:35,499
so you know that our host was this one
2168 once-over saves and we know what's

369
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:36,159
up

370
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:44,199
let's go ahead and try here so we're
gonna show options as always our hosts

371
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:54,459
we're going to set our host literally
were set then just actually

372
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:18,730
so this was a real thing so quick story
100 crystal balls wellness up the was at

373
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:25,270
a customer site just you know little
while ago and the customer said oh man

374
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,650
yeah we're good you know we don't have
our abilities many things I got the

375
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:36,790
right I got the they had several amazing
first man to our segment two hours 30

376
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:42,490
mistaken killing can figure out what's
going on so I did some more constant

377
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:50,320
find things like we will get this i did
some responses of my keys and I knew

378
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,490
were in that range but we're going to 75
found the slops floating around out

379
00:33:54,490 --> 00:34:02,620
there this is all your boxes they
totally forgot about right so I god i am

380
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:08,859
ok well we're just going to exploit to
talk so I ran SMS elaine 07 found out

381
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:16,210
that the domain administrator had logged
into it recently right and for whatever

382
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:21,460
reason they're using your credentials so
I got a touch of potentials and pass

383
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:28,570
along with graphics AG w main controller
other passwords great sorry

384
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,570
so bring your tag

385
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,620
let's assume that we got some matches we
need to load of something like crap you

386
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,620
know

387
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,819
here's your holistic commands here once
you've got some patches you can pass it

388
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:54,929
with brand map fired off check the
domain controller match right such a

389
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:59,730
standard sack if you wanted to do
something like a fishing server you can

390
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,710
load up something like go fish right

391
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:05,309
it's free to download which download and
install it

392
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:13,200
here's your fishing trip right let's set
it up add your users make campaign all

393
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:20,700
this within IBM right . at your morning
catfishing server with bullying is

394
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,538
Richard Moore their ace artificial guys
and you can look and see if it's

395
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,829
actually working

396
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:29,369
are they getting them click them see
what happens

397
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:45,480
straight right and then if you want to
attack you were little so we can see

398
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:54,269
what's open on that again reconnaissance
right

399
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:09,580
let me see it's got a whole bunch of
stuff it's got talent as the sages maybe

400
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:14,049
she'll version it's got all sorts of
stuff right

401
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,820
oh ok well what can I do with all that
so as I said the kind folks wrote up a

402
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:30,400
good little how to find either on the
website about exploiting most loyal so

403
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,520
it's got you know here's how to log in
right field services are fine running on

404
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:42,190
commander on find all those some unix
basics so you can like our login with

405
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,500
them get a root right it's all right up
to kind of follow step-by-step so you

406
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,270
can practice with that as well as
mortgage guys they got a good little

407
00:36:52,270 --> 00:37:06,220
setup for missile morning picture so
yeah several bad ones later you know

408
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,480
okay yeah schedule lab figured it out
get everything worked in practicing

409
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,480
going to do some additional training
there's a bunch of free tools out there

410
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,330
as well again guys over defense security
did a kind of course online that's free

411
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:26,799
call that this would unleash that will
get you through everything you want to

412
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,930
know about running most boy how to do
its cool secrets backends and things and

413
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:37,240
maybe kind of you get a little bit of
help in building on the site is still

414
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,500
relevant oversight but it's good for
training it's good for web app it's good

415
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,090
for you know just general happens
there's also plenty of videos all of the

416
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:52,120
Derby half-deaf com b-sides is a all
these organizations have videos out

417
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,310
there right go out and find go out to
see that talk build out that tool that

418

419
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:05,348
info seconds to cyber airy a whole bunch
of other you know

420
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:12,700
various training and things that you can

421
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:20,739

happy she was released right great baby

422
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:25,539
i love it still to this day i saw that
is your own time and I wanted to be

423
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:33,400
those got its man I want to be zero cool
i wanted to be lured by like and what do

424
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,220
we need to do i get there right now
you're a beginner top so that's that's

425
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,249
pretty cool

426
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:49,149
you can't get where you want to go if
you don't have the drive and motivation

427
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,200
to get there right you've got to put in
some work gotta have to drive to get

428
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,308
ahead of motivation

429
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:58,180
you also need to find a mental work okay
a lot of studying to learn on your own

430
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,739
but mentoring is so ridiculously
important wasn't ready

431
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:06,759
every time a couple things several times
for the things that stuck out where you

432
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:12,099
train with you fight and you know the
personal job of you versus the job below

433
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:18,880
so if your assistant admin and there's a
soft team learn those jobs your network

434
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,359
guy and there's a7 learn his job

435
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:28,479
figure it out build it out in the lab
right you're only gonna get better my

436
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:32,828
purview skillset learning and growing
part of that is through mentoring right

437
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:38,979
if you have an advanced skill sets
really really good without testing and

438
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:42,999
you see some guys are going to help map
offered to take Natalie show you some

439
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:48,519
cool things about testing if you're a
new guy or gal if you're new persons

440
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,848
security go out find somebody that's
really really good at something that you

441
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:56,380
want to reach out to head I want to do
what you do Katie show off the pan my

442
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,329
lunch whatever it takes right we can get
better by ourselves as well as we can

443
00:40:01,329 --> 00:40:03,609
getting better with each other right

444
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,160
why we come to places like the past what
kind of things

445
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,430
why would come to always talk because we
want to get better

446
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,520
the bad guys are out there and they're
getting better i promise you that

447
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,559
they're trying to kill your customers
networks they're trying to steal since

448
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:20,920
the day they're trying to destroy
whatever they came right and they're

449
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,819
getting better and their training all
the time in order for us to better

450
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:29,049
protect our presidents in order for us
to better serve ourselves in order for

451
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:34,150
us to better serve our customers and our
companies we have to get better we have

452
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,579
to help each other get better right

453
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:42,460
so find a mentor or be a mentor don't
keep your skill sets to yourself too

454
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:49,630
often and too many companies i've gone
to places where then we can do a B and C

455
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,680
because Jeff that was there for 30 years
never taught us right now we don't know

456
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,390
how it works that's unacceptable that is
that is beyond acceptable getting ready

457
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,980
to go out for your skill set down sit
down with somebody for a few weeks let

458
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,880
me teach you everything I do let me make
you the subject matter expert right if

459
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,359
you're coming in go find that guy that's
been there for 30 years of the body

460
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:16,990
myself go find Tom say man I want to
know everything you do teach me making

461
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:23,529
me you right go out financial
recommended reading again like I said

462
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:29,020
there are some great books out there I
having massive library and this is just

463
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,849
a small same way exploit would be able
to absolutely invaluable

464
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:39,010
I love those books he isn't a little bit
of a building we also gets a lot of tool

465
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,760
development how to have you know it's
it's fantastic

466
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:48,549
Jordan Munro but about penetration
testing kind of beginners manual as it

467
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:49,240
work

468
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,930
that's also a great book the country
roads metasploit you know kind of mental

469
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:01,390
model so i think the search president is
that there's also hacking their of

470
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,690
exploitation singers puts out a whole
bunch of books women's professional

471
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,619
penetration testing that goes more in
depth about building a little bit

472
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:13,089
different in the Gulf still works if
you're looking at doing some more social

473
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:14,080
engineering

474
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,549
more social Jerry engagements I
combining it's kind of a cat father of

475
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:22,450
all that he wrote a bunch of books or
intrusion detection and gets in the

476
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,439
wires those are great as reference
material to kind of go back and go okay

477
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,990
well that's a different way to think
about things because I'm trying to

478
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:33,189
protect a customer in front of you know
work my way to the customer site you
