1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
alright so as I stated earlier the talk
that was originally supposed to be in

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,639
this slot was me talking about medical
device security-related insulin pumps we

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,820
found some zero-day vulnerabilities in
the pump and we're working pretty

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,270
closely with the vendor and they need
some more time for the disclosure so we

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,580
pushed back by two weeks to help them
with that and so you'll find out about a

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,570
lot of the details related to that in in
two weeks but some of the technology

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,260
that I used and some of the techniques I
use came directly from my experience and

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,059
radios so when they asked me well do you
have another talk that you could give

9
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,579
even though it's only five days away

10
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,289
I said well I guess I could give a talk
on some of this ham radio stuff I want

11
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,660
to do and I said yeah that'd be great

12
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,640
so this is something I went together in
the last five days i have no idea if

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,160
it's going to take the entire hour or if
it's gonna take three hours with

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,069
material here but it's kind of an idea
that I've had for awhile to give at a

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,860
conference which is about license camera
operator since I was a kid and a lot of

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,250
the techniques and things that I've
learned in that hobby are things that i

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,360
use in my information security career
all the time so I wanted to kind of

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,340
compile them and show what things in
that hobby and the ideas that you learn

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,110
that hobby can be used

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,390
uh you know in practical application in
the security world this is me i asked my

21
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,189
dad for a picture of me taking apart
stuff and this is what he sent and I've

22
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,939
always been that kid I've always been
the kid taking things apart and trying

23
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,059
to figure out how they worked and from
an early age

24
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,869
ham radio has been kind of a rounded
part of my life

25
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,630
my dad's a ham radio operator his
brother is a ham radio operator and the

26
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,020
idea of ham radio operating to me is
kind of second nature and there's a lot

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,520
of controversy over like how the name
ham radio came to be about but basically

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,210
ham radio operators are hobbyists that
play in the radio community and you get

29
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,250
an FCC license and you're allowed to use
radios at certain powers at certain

30
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,319
frequencies

31
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,950
and there's been a lot of great talks
about what things you can do in ham

32
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,488
radio and what it is to get license that
i'm not going to cover because I want to

33
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:25,849
talk to you about some of the things
that goes on after you get a license

34
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:32,030
which i haven't seen covered too much in
a lot of these talks so where does my

35
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:38,329
story start well this is my dad .
embarrassingly probably drinking at the

36
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:43,669
kitchen table with a soldering iron
putting together or fixing something and

37
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:47,989
he ever since I was little has been
exposing me to the world of hardware

38
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:52,639
electronics he's big he's done computer
programming he does hardware programming

39
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,889
and overall has been a great dad and a
great mentor to me even to this day when

40
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:01,489
i run into problems when I'm
reverse-engineering a protocol for doing

41
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,439
RF stuff or even code

42
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,180
I'll call my dad and to get advice and
get a different I look at things and how

43
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:15,290
things work but in the summer 1988 we're
at the very peak of the solar spot cycle

44
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,590
and we're at the peak of the solar spot
cycle it's probably the most exciting

45
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,229
time for amateur radio operators because
it means that you don't eat very much to

46
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:28,189
talk all the way around the world and I
vividly remember that my dad had this

47
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,989
exact radio in this car it's a 10-meter
radio that you can be you can use it for

48
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,939
Syd CB radio as well but it puts out
only 10 watts and he had a little magma

49
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:42,198
antenna that you stuck on the top of his
car and I would remember going out and

50
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,959
sitting in the car listening these
stations that were all over the world

51
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,269
they were in South America they were in
Cuba there in Europe Australia and there

52
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,430
was nothing between me sitting in this
car and that other person either side of

53
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,530
the world and i think that that's
something that's lost in today that

54
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,489
magic we just kind of take it for
granted that we can spin up an email

55
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:11,599
send it off and gets where it's supposed
to go in half a second in 88 this was

56
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,940
crazy like it's crazy that I could do
this with a radio and a piece of wire

57
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,699
off the top of my dad's car and here and
talk to these people and instantly that

58
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:24,480
magic is what really had me hooked

59
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:32,190
so first to play in the game you gotta
get a license and back in eighty-eight

60
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:39,030
the licensing requirements still meant
that you had to learn morse code and

61
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,549
this was a really controversial thing
right

62
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,030
so for the very first test you had to
pass five words minute

63
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,559
whoo-hoo so this is what five words in
it sounds like

64
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,199
all now at the speed you could think of
it and you could probably look it up in

65
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,889
your head all right dash . all right
that's the you know and and something

66
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:14,270
like that so it's pretty easy the bars
pretty low to pass that as you advance

67
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,380
through the licenses they get harder so
13 words per minute is the next one

68
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:27,290
that's what it starts to speed up it
becomes not as easy to look up in your

69
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,180
head at 20 words per minute is the most
advanced license you can get and that's

70
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,180
what this sounds like

71
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,510
so those are the three classes now since
then they've removed all of the Morse

72
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:50,150
code requirements for the lace injure
the back back in my day and this is

73
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:54,409
something that ham radio has in common
with the security community is there's a

74
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:00,139
lot of people that are back in my day
people real hand did CW real hands did

75
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,889
Morse code you know real hand real
security people use the command line

76
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:10,520
very similar methodology is between
those two along with this code test you

77
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,210
took a multiple choice test that's very
technical just kind of study for it

78
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,620
memorized the questions

79
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,289
it really wasn't too bad at 12 years old
I pass license you get a call sign and

80
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:25,669
that call sign is unique to you and how
you identify yourself on the air and my

81
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:32,780
first call sign was na RHP and that
first part there the end part signifies

82
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,619
what country you're in and the eighth is
what section of the country you're in

83
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,210
so you can tell by a person's callsign
where they got license from originally

84
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:48,169
this is the very first radio I had it
was given to me as a gift by my uncle

85
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,910
it's a nineteen seventies handheld radio
it only covered for megahertz for the

86
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,699
bandwidth it was heavy use nicad
batteries i could probably knock

87
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:03,680
somebody out with it it was a great
little radio back in those days there

88
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,080
were several several hundred dollars and
that was that was really cool was a

89
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,240
great gift to have it was a

90
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,780
I very bond memories of it now the first
passion that I had with radio and ham

91
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:24,948
radio stuff is actually in packet radio
a packet radio was this concept and let

92
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:29,479
me but hopefully it sounds familiar is
you take two computers and you make them

93
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:30,919
communicate with each other

94
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:37,520
digitally and they can exchange
information so through a combination of

95
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,698
things through the HT in the computer I
i was able to load a program called NOS

96
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:49,909
network operating system and this nice
thing had a full list of this tcp i--

97
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:57,050
something tcp/ip thing and with tcp/ip I
could communicate and get my own IP

98
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,210
address because there's an entire class
a set aside for amateur radio

99
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,919
communication 244 net so you can see up
there that was the IP address that i got

100
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:15,650
back in 1989 and i was able to set up a
station with that IP address that was

101
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,359
able to do male that was able to use
ping finger was another command that we

102
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,860
used quite a bit if you remember this is
way before HTTP way before web browsers

103
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:33,469
and was also slow it was 1200 baud
half-duplex so i could only talk or

104
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:39,050
listen I couldn't do both at the same
time so to give you an idea who silly

105
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,049
thing give you an idea of what that
sounds like

106
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:52,330
that is this that is the first part of a
TCP handshake what it sounds like

107
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,560
also with this program was kind of neat
if you hit f9 you could see all of the

108
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,790
packets that could be heard on that
frequency that sounds kind of familiar

109
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,160
it was exactly like wireshark is for TCP
dump i can see the headers I could see

110
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,250
the tcp all the tcp fields and at 12 and
13 years old I was kind of figuring out

111
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,520
okay this is how the packets are
structured this is how they were talking

112
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:25,689
and it was really fascinating to play
with this type of technology and one of

113
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,940
the things that was kind of neat i lived
way up here my callsign now is n 80 s i

114
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,410
lived in the Detroit area and there's a
gateway down at Wayne State University

115
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:42,790
21.1 miles away and that gateway would
from Radio to the internet because Wayne

116
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,860
State back in the late eighties was you
know colleges had internet connection so

117
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:55,810
i couldn't quite get my signal all the
way to wayne state so what I ended up

118
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:01,719
having to do was I had to talk to a
friend of mine and I would route all of

119
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,450
my traffic that needed to go to the
internet to their also sounds very

120
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,380
familiar to what

121
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,810
maybe we do these days with routing and
i set my default route to that so i

122
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,469
couldn't communicate with something
directly i would go through that person

123
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,790
or maybe if i was going north of me
there would be another route that I

124
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,319
would take different thing in these
programs you had to set all of these

125
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,610
routes by hand so you were manually
making routing tables to figure out how

126
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,650
to route packets all over the place and
collectively back in the late eighties

127
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:41,230
early nineties you get all over the
United States purely on wireless with

128
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,890
the wireless connection connectivity
that goes around now since then

129
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,000
that's kind of a little bit falling off
the wayside because everybody's got high

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,780
speed internet at home but it's starting
to make a comeback that we'll talk about

131
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:58,569
a little later but the skills I learned
in in packet radio where I went to read

132
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:58,880
my

133
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,410
packets everything was going so slow
that i could actually I remember laying

134
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,620
in my bed and listening and saying all
that's a handshake

135
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,730
that's a piece email coming in just by
how long my transmitter was on and how I

136
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,890
could hear it because of how slow the
data it was being transmitted

137
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,060
so if you were to slow down a TCP
handshake and listen to it you could do

138
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,699
that at that speed and building routing
tables is something that a that became

139
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,840
second nature but you know what

140
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,650
and really didn't want to depend on
somebody else to get down to that hand

141
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,340
gate

142
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,660
I wanted to have a direct internet
connection so how do I do that I'm 12

143
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,510
years old I need to build an antenna is
what i need to do now I don't have any

144
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,689
money because their child labor laws and
my dad's gonna buy the antenna and hams

145
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:59,750
have a long history of building stuff
out of garbage of taking things apart

146
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:06,920
taking junk and building something else
so i built what you see up there on the

147
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,680
screen i got a broken hockey stick

148
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,510
I some dollars from the hardware store
the leftover wire from a construction

149
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:20,870
site and a 20-ounce pop bottle and with
the knowledge that I had from passing

150
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:27,470
the tests i was able to build a cubicle
clot and with that i was able to easily

151
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:34,250
talk down to that hand gate and
directionally move the antenna to talk

152
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,860
to other people and this was pretty cool

153
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,730
I was so bummed when I would start
looking for pictures this week because i

154
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,330
was like dad why do we take pictures any
of this stuff he was like you mean that

155
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,160
junkie antenna that you built that you
stuck at top your bedroom like yeah he

156
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,160
was like I'd never thought you would
need a picture of it

157
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,100
and i was like i really wish i had a
picture of it so this is close as I

158
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,000
could get

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,480
but it's really kind of cool and like I
said there's a history of this and hams

160
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,790
love doing this kind of stuff

161
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,810
how about an old beat-up launch it
doesn't work anymore right

162
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,489
very easily this guy took this aluminum
frame lawn chair and built-in antenna

163
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,240
out of it

164
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,900
how about a broken tape measure broken
tape measure in a couple pieces of

165
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,199
leftover plumbing material PVC and you
have a very accurate a high powered

166
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,930
antenna the thing that I learned here is
that knowledge is more important than

167
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,069
commercial tools right you can go out
and buy any kind of commercial tool you

168
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,750
want but having the knowledge on how to
build things on your own whether that is

169
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,550
an antenna or shell script or whatever
it maybe sometimes it's better because

170
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,420
you actually have the knowledge on what
it is and how it's working as opposed to

171
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:58,569
just quit taking it out of the box and
sticking it and hoping it works you can

172
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,430
build things that you need to be
creative i mean i think that's that's

173
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,719
part of having fun

174
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,250
um you know I've always think thought of
hacking as taking something that has a

175
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,920
function and making you do something
that was never intended to do like this

176
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,130
slinky this is one of the more popular
intends to build as you get to

177
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:24,550
old-school slinkies and you can make an
antenna out of them and taking things

178
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,870
and making them do something else
whether it's a program whether it's a

179
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,520
website whether it's a toy and making it
do something else is a lot of what our

180
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:41,740
security field is and about how we think
about it so on the next thing of

181
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:49,570
building things I got into kit building
and this is something that has become a

182
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,160
lot more prominent and a lot more useful
as we have gotten into hardware hacking

183
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,630
and that's become an Internet of Things
take things apart look at the circuitry

184
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,670
well I would be I would build kits
here's an example of a kit that I built

185
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,380
it's just a bag of parts you've got to
get a soldering iron and learn how to

186
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,949
read a schematic and nowhere to put the
parts in so I could remember as a kid

187
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:16,689
sitting with my dad at the kitchen table
building things like this learning how

188
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,310
to solder how to troubleshoot things
when it didn't work and never did the

189
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,880
first time you tried to build it it's
really the foundation of hardware

190
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,269
hacking the history of kids for ham
radio operators goes a long way back you

191
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:35,380
know this right here is probably one of
the most famous kid companies that there

192
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,519
was which is he KITT and heat it was
based on a Benton Harbor Michigan and

193
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,360
they made tons of radio kits this one
right here being the one of the most

194
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,069
popular which is a 2000 watt amplifier
you could buy this for a couple hundred

195
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:52,810
box back in the sixties and they are
still in use and quite popular because

196
00:15:52,810 --> 00:16:01,268
they don't die and they're easy to
repair and they're worth quite a bit so

197
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:06,009
these kits have so much documentation
and you learn so much by building them

198
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:10,029
that it really produced a great
foundation for learning electrical

199
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:17,019
theory and learning how to build and
take apart things now today they're a

200
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,480
lot more advanced but they still exist

201
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,079
this is the most popular kit company
right now it's l craft and they're based

202
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:28,689
out of the Pacific Northwest and they
built this is kind of their flagship not

203
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:29,110
there

204
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,519
this used to be the flagship radio but
this is a kit that you can build and the

205
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,850
kit looks like this that circuit board I
you have to put all the parts on it so

206
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,810
you have to solder it together and you
have to align it and it's a process that

207
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,040
takes about a month to build that radio
but at the end of that month you will

208
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,689
have built a radio and you will have no
you will know how to tune that radio and

209
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:55,899
you will know all the pieces where the
amplification section is where the

210
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:00,880
oscillators are and that's kinda neat
you know that's kind of an exciting

211
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,019
prospect

212
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,049
you know we don't get a chance to do
something like that where we build

213
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:08,859
something from scratch and it's it's
been it

214
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:12,250
it's always a fascinating process and
because of that these kids are extremely

215
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,240
popular

216
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:20,170
the skills I learned there are i mean
this is the foundation of all the

217
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,400
hardware hacking that i do when i take
apart an insulin pump or medical device

218
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,610
or an Internet of thing or whatever it's
just like being a kid again it's

219
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,850
soldering it son soldering things it's
trying to make it work

220
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,850
it's trying to make it do something it
wasn't supposed to do in the first place

221
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,870
also being able to diagnose and
troubleshoot hardware

222
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,290
oh well i know that if i don't have the
ground setup right this isn't gonna work

223
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:50,080
or it's going to act like in this way
also gets need to build things you know

224
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,649
that the hacking community as a whole
has really gotten into a making

225
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:59,170
community with 3d printers and arenas
and raspberry PI's and this these two

226
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,559
areas really mesh well together and
learning how to read a schematic and

227
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:12,129
build those type of electrical circuits
going to talk a little bit about some of

228
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:18,520
the radio sports and these are
competitive features of radio so one of

229
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,639
the first that I participated in as a
teenager was something called fox

230
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,380
hunting and fox hunting is the sport of
finding the physical location of a

231
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,520
transmitter you got a picture up here of
some kids with a directional antenna

232
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,420
very similar to the one built out of the
tape measure i showed you earlier and

233
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,020
they're working on trying to find this
transmitter the transmitter could be

234
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,020
really small like it could be hidden in
a tree

235
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,650
it's usually battery-powered it's
usually maybe the size it would fit in

236
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,330
your hand so you use directional
antennas to determine the source of the

237
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,260
signal and then you try and track it
down and they have competitions for how

238
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:59,320
quickly people can can find it on foot
or to find it in a car and this is a

239
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,980
really kind of a practical thing because
if you have something interfering with

240
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,660
the radio signal or maybe interfering
with a wireless network you need to be

241
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,929
able to track down the physical location
of that transmitter so you can do

242
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:16,210
something about it also

243
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,470
back into this creativity element this
is something that my dad and I had built

244
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,799
one of these this isn't the exact one
because again we didn't take pictures of

245
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,570
the junk that we made because why would
we need pictures of it but this is a

246
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,549
Doppler unit and what this is is a small
microprocessor would switch between four

247
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:40,730
antennas and the Doppler shift in the
signal between the four antennas was

248
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,540
able to calculate the direction in the
heading of the signal so we could have

249
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,220
this strapped to the top of the car and
drive and the LED would point to the

250
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,690
direction of where the transmitter was
located and that's something that we

251
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,900
built from scratch on our own which was
kinda cool

252
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:05,330
the skills I learned here I learned a
lot about wireless signals and wireless

253
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,939
networking housing signals get
manipulated it by physical structures as

254
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,530
you get more advanced into fox hunting
they put which the transmitter in

255
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:21,049
sneakier places like up against metal
buildings or near power lines and it

256
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:24,620
becomes really confusing when the signal
gets picked up by those power lines or

257
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,110
bounces off of buildings not all that
much different than wireless networks

258
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:36,379
and how we map a wireless network but
also it was fun like it was the way that

259
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,370
they set these up were really tiny
things and you were going and hunting

260
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:45,979
around for him it felt very spy-like so
as a teenager I thought it was a blast

261
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:53,929
it was like treasure hunting one of my
passions really became a contest as a

262
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:59,330
radio sport con testing is a sport where
you try and make the most amount of

263
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:04,879
context in a set amount of time and you
exchange the information accurately this

264
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,690
and information could be very simple
like what state you're in and how much

265
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,980
power you're running or it could be
complex it could be your name a unique

266
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,110
serial number the first year licensed
the county or in things like that

267
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,510
so there's a 24 there's a 12-hour 24
hour and 48 hour period that they might

268
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,890
have these contests where you try and
contact as many people as possible the

269
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,860
most popular methods of contests are
voice and surprisingly to some Morse

270
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,379
code which is referred to as CW
continuous-wave the rates for how

271
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,550
quickly you can make contacts at a big
station can exceed 200 contacts an hour

272
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:50,550
which is a lot of information and the
reason that these contests became

273
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:56,909
popular and have been kind of used
throughout the years is this is how you

274
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:04,170
prepared for an emergency if you needed
to pass a lot of information to let's

275
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,090
say the entire phone system went out for
all the power in the United States went

276
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,730
out how would we exchanged messages

277
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:16,140
well we could use radios to do that and
we could use radios to exchange this

278
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,710
information accurately and effectively
all over the place

279
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:26,040
I had a wonderful opportunity to work at
what I would refer to as a superstation

280
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,260
which is a station that has a lot of
antennas and a lot of investment

281
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,970
equipment in order to compete at a very
high level so this is one of the super

282
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,470
stations that I I I didn't operate this
one but I operated one very similar so

283
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,250
each of those towers are probably a
hundred and sixty feet tall on each of

284
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:50,700
those antennas are at least 40 feet long
so right there you have enough antenna

285
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,910
you you probably have half a million
dollars just an antenna equipment there

286
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,780
and then each of those antennas are
hooked up the radios usually in some

287
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,490
kind of a bunker or house nearby there
it's pretty cool to see that kind of a

288
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,300
setup

289
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:09,510
this is actually the setup that I that I
worked at in ypsilanti michigan at the

290
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:16,620
guys call signs KCC and he has four
different and 10 are raised and his

291
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,610
entire basement is radio equipment and
he's invested a lot of time in competing

292
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,809
at that and he has records for the most
amount of contacts in some of these

293
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:27,610
contests

294
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,549
give you an idea of the scale of some of
this stuff i mean there those are the

295
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:35,049
two people up there working on the
antenna arrays those are big and tennis

296
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:43,480
a giant this is the rack of amplifiers
and all of those amplifiers put out

297
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,210
2,000 watts of peace and they're all
hand-built so the creativity and the

298
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,170
amount of knowledge that you need to
build this type of equipment is pretty

299
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,790
excessive and also to not interfere with
the other stations that are right there

300
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:04,899
two feet away give you an idea what a
contest sounds like I've got two

301
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:14,740
examples here voice example and icw
example so there's only 30 seconds each

302
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,100
of them so hopefully you can hear it

303
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:33,668
ya know president killing 15 tengo radio
your heart for cargo box 16 go find 176

304
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:40,090
/ trihard thank you killed my 510 go
radio power your little 9000 radio find

305
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:48,340
out 177 your kind of primary role thank
you for 15 tengo radio for BTW find 178

306
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:55,059
so you can see he's working those
stations he's exchanging information you

307
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:58,299
know and a unique serial number and
getting it back from them but you can

308
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:02,860
also it's a little hard to hear those
radio stations are calling three or four

309
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,649
at a time and he's able to sort those
out in his head by just by listening and

310
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,880
a very quick rate which is impressive he
did over 21 contacts here in three

311
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,980
minutes in CW you can go even faster

312
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:25,780
most of the contests most of the really
good high-end contest operators prefer

313
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,350
to do CW where

314
00:25:36,140 --> 00:26:38,300
so it's kind of on its kind of a unique
way I've always been amazed at the

315
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,710
people that can sit with headphones on
listening that and be like have a

316
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,330
conversation with me and decode that in
our head and type in the station so

317
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:53,929
remember and just work people and I'm
like that's never been anything I could

318
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,500
do

319
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:01,700
I've never been a master at the Morse
code proportion of us so it's need now

320
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,440
just about everybody has their first
contest experience with the same contest

321
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,640
it's a special contest referred to his
field day and field day is special

322
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,730
because the object is to start with an
empty field with nothing and in 24 hours

323
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,860
set up a station and that station needs
to operate for 24 hours and you make as

324
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,909
many contexts as possible and you get
extra points for using alternative power

325
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:31,430
and doing it in public locations and the
object here is to simulate a very

326
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:36,110
realistic scenario whether it be a
hurricane or tornado a terrorist attack

327
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:41,270
where you lose all communication and
then you set up a station to communicate

328
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:46,269
all over the United States and exchange
that information and it's

329
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:51,099
really popular because everybody can
participate in it because everybody's

330
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:55,658
kind of starting from scratch in an
empty field or in a park or at their

331
00:27:55,659 --> 00:28:03,309
house but you're not allowed to use any
existing antenna structures so this is

332
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:07,178
an example of like a field day setup
they went out into the woods and they

333
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:11,229
put these antennas up in the in a couple
hours and they're gonna operate for 24

334
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:18,729
hours exchange information all over the
United States you know what talk a

335
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:22,509
little bit about CW and morse code to
give you an example to give you an idea

336
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:28,119
of why it's still really popular is that
it's the original digital mode this is

337
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:32,559
how we were sending what this is how we
send ones and zeros it's on and off key

338
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,119
which is used in a lot of Internet of
Things transmitters right now and it's

339
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:42,488
exceptionally efficient you can see on
this slide there's a lot of signals

340
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:45,789
there's a lot of people transmitting
Morse code here but the amount of

341
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:51,099
bandwidth that this is using is
minuscule it's . 007 megahertz worth of

342
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:59,619
bandwidth to give you an idea of your
wireless 802 11 signal is usually 20

343
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:05,019
megahertz wider 40 megahertz wide so
that's this is not even a dot on the

344
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:10,059
stat spectrum relative and we've got at
least 20 stations communicating to each

345
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:14,918
other effectively here so it's really
efficient way of communicating in a

346
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,539
pretty good amount of information

347
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:23,109
one of the big things that amateur radio
has gotten into in the past that it's

348
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:26,978
always been a big part of amateur radio
but especially in the past ten years is

349
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:32,169
emergency communication and when they
had a slip they have a slogan that when

350
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:37,179
all else fails that amateur radio is
there we have become totally and

351
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:44,559
completely dependent on cell phones on
the internet and on that technology and

352
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,559
what happens when it stops working

353
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:53,870
we've had situations where it has in
hurricanes in third world countries

354
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,669
where amateur radio operators were able
to stand up and start communicating

355
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:06,290
statuses and coordinate rescue efforts
within hours and sometimes less

356
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,639
so a lot of amateur radio operators are
very proud of their commitment to

357
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,120
emergency communications and being able
to respond to disaster situations like

358
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,899
that the skills I learned here I learned
a lot about disaster recovery when we

359
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,400
advise customers on you know when I
advise customers on disaster recovery I

360
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,190
talk about testing and I talk about
what's going to happen when your phone

361
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,670
stopped working and they go oh what's
the chances of my phone's not working

362
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,700
um and I realistically know that that's
a possibility

363
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,350
do you do disaster recovery planning
have you tested this equipment out so

364
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,429
that it works

365
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,610
one of the reasons that field day is
popular is because it's every year in

366
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:48,560
June it gives you a chance to test out
that all your kit that you could take

367
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,990
into the woods and set up a station if
you had to and that testing only get

368
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,380
this only stuff only works when it's
tested completely and it's done often

369
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,810
passing traffic and messages and all
forms of communication or down is

370
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,250
something that's really important

371
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:09,680
how do you do that at your company you
know if something were to happen we know

372
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,440
we saw something that happened with
hurricane sandy when it came through on

373
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,550
the east coast is your debt disaster
recovery plan have the ability to

374
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,260
communicate with other forms of other
forms of communication are down that you

375
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,950
can't text how do you find those people
that are in your disaster recovery plan

376
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:30,020
it's important i also learned about
building incredibly complex radio

377
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,730
systems with lots of transmitters at
high power and that's been very handy

378
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:41,330
for things like devices that communicate
with wireless signals that maybe your

379
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:48,770
exchange data with cell phones or
medical devices i'm gonna go over a

380
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:52,430
couple of other areas that I don't have
a ton of experience with but are

381
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,050
definitely big in the community

382
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:59,120
the first is there's a lot of space
stuff that goes on there's a whole

383
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,979
section of the hobby that build
satellites

384
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,360
the thing that you see on the far
right-hand side is ham sath five it's a

385
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,540
satellite that hobbyist built that nasa
put in space that orbits that orbits

386
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,610
outer space and the picture on the left
there is a little girl in a guy working

387
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,479
that satellite with that intent that
he's holding and a small handheld radio

388
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,340
and just imagine that that's that's a
radio that puts out five watts of power

389
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,059
that's no bigger than your cell phone
and it's talking to a satellite space

390
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,059
that's pretty cool

391
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,489
a lot of the astronauts on the ISS space
station are amateur radio operators and

392
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,970
they do a lot of operating from the
space station so there's often

393
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:46,590
classrooms that get to talk to them
through amateur radio and through ham

394
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:52,139
radio connections so there's a lot going
on and that in the space world with

395
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,780
amateur radio a hobbyist level now we
can talk about some even crazier stuff

396
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,040
right

397
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,210
this is called a moonbounce array and
what this is is if you get enough

398
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:08,160
antennas and enough power and you can
see the moon you about signal off it so

399
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:15,179
maybe I can only talk 10 miles with my
little handheld radio on the same

400
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,750
frequency with this antenna array and a
whole bunch of power i could talk from

401
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,760
here to Europe if the moons in the right
spot

402
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,960
wow that's got crazy that's hacking
right let's bounce some stuff off the

403
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:35,580
moon and we can get much further signals
about meteors meteor standard is

404
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,030
something that we we can use quite a lot
on different things so if we know

405
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:44,490
there's a meteor shower we can we can go
thousands of kilometers between two

406
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,870
stations where normally we wouldn't be
able to do that by aiming our signal at

407
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,889
the trail of the meteors or the where
the meteor shower is happening and

408
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,330
bouncing the signal off of that these
are some of the crazy things that you

409
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,220
can do in the hobby in the hobby of
radio and to me this is like classic

410
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,770
hacking right like that's crazy you
can't do that that there's no

411
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,770
possibility that work well I want to try
it anyway

412
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:18,768
there's a huge group of enthusiasts that
really love the low-power aspect they

413
00:34:18,768 --> 00:34:21,828
want to see how far they can go on a
little power as possible

414
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:29,929
qrp is it is kind of a slang term for
very low power usually under 5 watts the

415
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:34,220
record as it sits right now from what I
was able to find is two stations between

416
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:38,689
Alaska and oregon in 1970 were able to
go

417
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:45,710
sixteen hundred and fifty miles using
one micro watt and so that is the

418
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:52,099
equivalent of 1.6 billion miles per watt
that's crazy like and that's the truth

419
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,279
that's very similar to the transmitter
that they were using is what you see

420
00:34:55,279 --> 00:35:01,069
there they build it in an Altoids tin
it's pretty creative stuff

421
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:10,130
Morse code has been actually increasing
in popularity since since they got rid

422
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,289
of that requirement in the license test

423
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:17,299
I don't really know how to explain it
people are very competitive with it the

424
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:20,599
speeds can get an excess of 200 words
per minute

425
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,039
I mean you saw how quickly that was and
that was roughly around 30 is about how

426
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:30,200
fast you heard some of that stuff 200
doesn't really sound like any human

427
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:37,460
sounds more like aliens are contrasting
people often 30 50 words a minute is

428
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,509
usually where they kind of hang out at
speed-wise again they do it all in their

429
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:50,269
head conversational going back to like
community stuff

430
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:54,828
public service is another big piece that
ham radio operators do they have clubs

431
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:58,609
and these clubs will get together and
they will provide communication for

432
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:02,210
parades will provide communication for
athletic events like marathons

433
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:08,180
triathlons here you see one at that my
dad was participating in in the state of

434
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,249
Michigan where they were doing
communications like for a bike ride and

435
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:17,058
this gives the ability for them to be
able to communicate if somebody got hurt

436
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:21,470
if somebody needs to get somebody needs
to get picked up those types of things

437
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,828
we think that cell phones would be great
for that but when you get out

438
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:30,779
we know how we know how great cell phone
communication works when you're out the

439
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:38,219
middle of nowhere this is a much more
reliable method another area that's

440
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:43,349
always been popular is collecting what
are called qsl cards in qsl is ham radio

441
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:48,749
slang for a verified communication so a
lot of ham radio operators will have a

442
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:52,529
card a little postcard and they'll say
yes I'm confirming that i talked to you

443
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:58,529
at this day at this time with this
information you collect these cards and

444
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:02,160
you can get awards for these cards so
there's a work call State's award

445
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:07,349
there's a work call countenance award
there's a work call countries award or

446
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:11,819
worked a hundred countries award so you
collect these cards and you can put them

447
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:14,849
on your wall you can see all these are
all the places that I've talked to

448
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:20,640
through my radio station and it's been a
very popular way to collect them as

449
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,440
we've got into the digital age

450
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,729
this has turned into eqs l cards and
there's several sites that specialize in

451
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:30,808
matching this information up and
automatically instead of mailing a

452
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:36,029
postcard now we do that digitally
verifying that we heard and it and

453
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:46,380
communicated with this other person
we're also seeing some recycling here so

454
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:52,199
this is an older linksys router and ham
radio operators are starting to you by

455
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:56,759
up some of this equipment and modifying
the firmware and building entirely

456
00:37:56,759 --> 00:38:03,150
independent off the off the internet
networks that are high-speed multimedia

457
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:09,959
mesh networks so because amateur radio
operators can use more frequency and

458
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:14,969
more power and larger antennas they're
buying this equipment modifying the

459
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:21,749
firmware and then building their own ISP
they're building their own wireless

460
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:25,529
infrastructure to communicate almost
exactly like we were doing in the

461
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:29,969
eighties except for not at 1200 baud
have to place which is pretty cool

462
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:37,049
it's a great way of repurposing going
back to that original kind of

463
00:38:37,049 --> 00:38:39,450
methodology and concept of hack

464
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,230
is taking things that are other people's
garbage repurposing them and making them

465
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:50,910
into something that's extremely useful
so we're by using all these ham radio

466
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,080
skills now

467
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:58,380
well at 900 megahertz is there's an eye
is what we call the is M band or the

468
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,640
mics band and this is used quite a bit
in the medical world a lot of medical

469
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:10,470
devices communicate on this band they're
designed to be very short distance so

470
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:17,009
maybe only 10 feet is how they're
supposed to communicate like if you had

471
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:23,490
a pacemaker or an insulin pump that's
what they design that effective range to

472
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:29,640
do but as we've talked about we could
build antennas and get much further we

473
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,650
can use higher power and we can get much
further and communicate with them we

474
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:39,420
also have a lot of equipment in in the
world especially in the power grid world

475
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,340
that runs at 400 megahertz which is also
right near a hand ham radios spectrum

476
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:50,370
this goes back again to we can build
antennas we can do things to communicate

477
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:55,650
with them in ways they were intended to
be communicated with about RFID chips

478
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:01,260
those run at 13 megahertz a lot of those
contests super stations the pictures

479
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,580
that you saw in there those amplifiers
and that equipment would work on the

480
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,670
rfid of 13 megahertz

481
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,740
hmm what can i do with giant hundred and
sixty foot towers and two kilowatts of

482
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:20,910
power with an RFID how far can I talk to
it I know and obviously software radio

483
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:26,850
has become really huge now that we have
so much horsepower in our computers we

484
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:31,200
can do a lot more with software than we
could in building and we can hear

485
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,350
farther and we can process more in that
time hack RF one is a great example of

486
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:41,430
that in the last several years these
come to be two hundred dollars and are

487
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:45,540
heavily used now in the hacking
community in the internet of things in

488
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,540
in the hardware hacking world

489
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:55,910
so here's an example of some work so
this is a yardstick one another tool

490
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:03,500
that's similar to hack RF and it puts
out 0.01 wants but at a ham radio

491
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,210
convention i bought an amplifier an
amplifier will make that into a hundred

492
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,650
watts

493
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,900
that's a pretty substantial increase in
power I'm license with my FCC license to

494
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,430
go up to 1500 watts if i want to but 100
watts will be enough for now

495
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:28,430
now for every 3 DB of increase that's
like doubling your power so i put some

496
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:33,020
and i bought some antennas that you can
see here in the pictures that double and

497
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,490
triple and quadruple the amount of power
but not only that they quadruple the

498
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:43,310
amount of listening that I can do so I
can listen further with these types of

499
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:49,279
antennas and in a single direction so
what's possible

500
00:41:49,910 --> 00:42:00,410
that's a great question what could you
talk to with 10,000 times more power and

501
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:07,490
eight times more listening capability
that would be in the medical world how

502
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:13,160
far could you get or the smart grid
world or in the Internet of Things world

503
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:19,160
these are the kind of cool things that I
like to work we work on a new research

504
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:25,430
on because i don't know i don't have a
lot of the answers those questions I

505
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,720
have a lot of fun doing this type of
stuff and using my hobby and using the

506
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:35,750
25 years I've been doing ham radio stuff
to play around medical devices and to

507
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:40,790
say when people come up to me and say
well you can't talk to that medical

508
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:45,589
device it's more than 10 feet away and I
kind of smile and I think we can bounce

509
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:51,140
a signal off the moon at almost the same
at the same frequency range and I could

510
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,480
talk to somebody in europe i think i can
get a quarter mile away i think i can

511
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,740
get a half a mile away

512
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,009
I don't think that's going to be a
problem

513
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,950
and that's surprising to people but hams
have been doing this for decades have

514
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:10,839
been pushing the boundaries on what's
possible and that's something that's

515
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,110
really exciting and they still continue
to do that today I'm taking things

516
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:19,750
taking other people's garbage things
that are disposable and reusing them

517
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:27,820
very much like a hacking culture would
so that is what I have to thank you guys

518
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,820
for coming and I hope you enjoyed it

519
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:50,130
oh yeah sorry
