1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
yeah all right

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:11,790
hey thanks for comin this is a hacking
and protecting sharepoint before I just

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,890
before i get started i know you guys
know I don't know I saw the movie Edward

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:23,189
Snowden coming off seeing it now that
movie so good i don't know how much of

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:30,420
its Hollywood but i would say if I saw
that movie when I was a young buck i

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,930
would probably want to work for the NSA
even though they've done him a pretty

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,870
good pretty bad deal so little bit about
me

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,000
my name is Michael Wharton I'm a project
MVP i do a lot with sharepoint and

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,320
project server and I do a lot with
powershell and hacking has been somewhat

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,390
of a hobby for me

11
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,570
the other thing I like to read a lot of
comics some these are just some of my

12
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,500
favorites

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,030
there's one called hacktivist is kinda
was kind of cool comic ever read and

14
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,930
then right now I'm reading a book called
Damien has been written about 15-20

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:21,630
years ago that's real good and it's
about a process it's running while also

16
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,720
like a lot of hardware I i have my this
this is a picture of my workstation got

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,640
my rack with a bunch of servers in there
and then I've got a machine they like to

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,909
play with for high performance and I put
different i basically melt ice i put a

19
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,310
big block of ice in the bucket and just
have the coolers of chill the process

20
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,490
and you see how fast i can get it but
this is about sharepoint and hacking and

21
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,149
show you some things how how to hack
sure . and then i'm gonna show you some

22
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,830
ways to protect it

23
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,270
so this this will be the agenda that
will be talking about how many out

24
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,940
currently work with SharePoint or seeing
sharepoint looks like it roughly half

25
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:11,880
maybe everybody I don't know anyway just
to give a little definition with

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,130
sharepoint is it it's been around for
some time and it's a collaborative tool

27
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,500
for sharing documents and searching for
things and you have a basic element box

28
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,140
will just cost you points standard often
comes free and then if you pay a little

29
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,000
bit more you get the enterprise version
that's built on top of this the standard

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,990
and it has a other features in there
like business intelligence and

31
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,900
dashboards and a lot of other of
services it runs if you've never seen

32
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,160
sharepoint this is what it kind of looks
like there's a team site is very easily

33
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,340
configurable you can throw up together
sites customize and modified at web

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,959
parts and because it's so flexible you
don't have to be an IT guy to work with

35
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,489
it and then the other side of this thing
called sharepoint central and that this

36
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,630
is worthy at administrators can
configure sharepoint and this just a

37
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,670
screenshot of what that looks like

38
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:17,609
but probably which most he didn't know
where hopefully we should pay something

39
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,470
new about sharepoint it really started
back in nineteen eighty-five it was a

40
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,810
software package called a mere front
page one point of is anybody remember

41
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,900
that the old-timers in here and the
reason I bring it up the company was

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,870
called premier Technologies Incorporated
and there's this acronym vti and if you

43
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,940
worked with sharepoint you stuck--you
you'll see this VTS is so it's been

44
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,690
around it's been around a long time and
the reason is Microsoft ball front page

45
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:58,920
and then they rebranded its front page
and then it went through many years of

46
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,619
generations and enhancements in fact one
time Microsoft has had hundreds of

47
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,450
thousands of these front pages web sites
though at one point they said

48
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:16,918
let's put this into a package and then
later around 2,000 it became sharepoint

49
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,200
and it's gone through many different
generations to what it to what it is

50
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,130
today

51
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:30,210
now just again a little bit about the
architect easily you have in users that

52
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,440
play out

53
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:39,090
oh honey that time myself and users at
mcleod go through afar firewall will be

54
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,280
a couple of that maybe one or more front
and servers will talk to a back-end

55
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:51,630
servers and then we'll talk to get could
talk to the sequel database these this

56
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,750
this is what they refer to as a
sharepoint farm and that can be many

57
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,100
different ways this can be architect and
then if you're on the inside of the

58
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,590
firewall you have internal users and
talk to the front end and they do what

59
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,770
they do share . now the other thing i
want to point out is somewhat for those

60
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,240
who worked with windows and internet
information server if you've ever been

61
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,410
to their internet internet information
services and kind of browse and here

62
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,150
you'll start seeing this BTW a stuff and
this is today you still see these

63
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,429
acronyms or names called vti and this is
important because when i talk about

64
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,430
happy you're going to see this over and
over again

65
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:44,099
so what we'll get into more about the
hacking part but i just kind of found

66
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,880
this interesting this is a page from the
e details . com it shows up all the

67
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,570
vulnerabilities are currently found and
you can if you go to this web page and

68
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:04,919
then click on products you'll get a
search bar and if you is in that search

69
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,440
bar type of sharepoint server g-type
sharepoint you're not going

70
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,530
we'll get some some smaller this if you
type sharepoint server you'll get all

71
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,250
the vulnerabilities you can see how they
kind of program out

72
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,200
into different categories for each year
and then also broke them down into

73
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:32,130
different areas where there's a
vulnerability that the thing I would say

74
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,670
about these vulnerabilities SharePoint's
actually pretty secure

75
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,710
most of these vulnerabilities are really
coming out of Excel Word outlook and and

76
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,710
all these other tools attached to it

77
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:56,640
so who are the sharepoint hackers oh
thank you

78
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:05,460
first button so you want to share .
hackers well last year I was in a tight

79
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,049
i spoke here on power show and I said
who the hackers and few people raise

80
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,250
their hands

81
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,840
so how many people are hackers in it
nobody's with it but having our pin

82
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,169
testers that's when so much that was a
pen testers and then there's the dark

83
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:28,260
army who knows with the anybody with the
dark army is no there's a TV series

84
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:34,530
called mr. robot gotta watch that that
thing that is just an awesome awesome TV

85
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,969
series it just ended up the second
season yesterday but there's some really

86
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,410
good hackers in there but also the
sharepoint hackers are employees we have

87
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,850
we have to trust the employees and we
also given permission and anything but

88
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,540
actually we probably shouldn't give it
permission to do things because they can

89
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,380
taking damage sharepoint and then
there's developers we never want to

90
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,990
trust them but they can also hack the
system and the administrators they're

91
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,720
given the power to basically have
sharepoint so that so you have different

92
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,050
ways that this can be a hat now the
hacking methods for sharepoint that

93
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,730
there's several of 1 i'll just call
brute force and i'll give you some

94
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:24,000
examples of that and that's where you
just go in there either manually or ro

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,030
write a script and you start looking for
things that are wrong and sharepoint and

96
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,478
my favorite way to do that is using the
search engine

97
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:43,110
the search engine because in Google you
can type this type inurl colon and give

98
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:50,040
a last part of this extension right here
underscored layouts and view list and it

99
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:57,180
will show you all the websites that have
that in search now if you see that that

100
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,910
means those websites are anonymous and
and when it when i say anonymously if

101
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,689
you can

102
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:09,420
at that point you can go into sharepoint
and start browsing around two areas that

103
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,459
you're not really probably shouldn't be
looking at again I said SharePoint's

104
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:21,479
very it's a it's a very secure product
and where it fails is where people make

105
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,180
it anonymous and exposed to the outside
if it's on the inside it's not quite a

106
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,810
big quite a big deal and I am gonna give
you some examples of that now the other

107
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,579
way of doing it is using being and they
call it in stream and I don't think it

108
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:45,420
works quite as well but it can also
display some pages for you some of

109
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,599
hacking methods is a port scanning there
are a lot of services and endpoints and

110
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,500
sharepoint that you that you can attach
to and pull up and and what you want to

111
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,339
do is it is sharepoint is misconfigured
your servers will then be misconfigured

112
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:11,100
and i will talk more about that but it's
these port scans that you wanna run

113
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,430
through your network because in
sharepoint you don't want to just open

114
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,388
up everything you want to open up only
the port's the chair . needs which we'll

115
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,550
talk about we talk about protecting it

116
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:27,029
oh I and and that's what i was saying
here or uh then he wrecks external

117
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:34,260
sharepoint sites if your sharepoint is
not set up properly then your servers

118
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,389
are going to be easier to hack because
they're not gonna be set up properly and

119
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,529
then there's this to this website called
showed a in that if you go to this

120
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:47,100
showdown site it will it will also show
you all

121
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,920
all the servers in the world that are
showing up the showing sharepoint in the

122
00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:01,110
in their descriptions so some of the key
things I search for is this extension

123
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,500
right here layouts you list

124
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:11,130
this is a big potential leak for data
because once you get in there you're on

125
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:19,439
their site you can search for vti band
again if you if you're seeing this

126
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,790
finish it's indicating this is an
anonymous site and you don't need any

127
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:31,439
credentials for logging in these other
variations in fact this was actually

128
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,870
real interesting if you say layout /
user dis dat aspx and force equals true

129
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:48,180
and then put an ID of zero it'll pull
back a user record it and once it pulls

130
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,250
it back you can in a full information
like their username their email address

131
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,000
their first and last name and just
general information that might be found

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,300
in the sharepoint profile and I've got a
script that will iterate through zero

133
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:11,040
through a hundred and and find although
the users on sharepoint site now I was

134
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,120
running through this haven't done this
top and when I was running the last

135
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,080
night or so and I what I have found is
Microsoft is actually tighten up their

136
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,940
security and some of these some of these
routines don't work as well as they used

137
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:34,650
to before patches were blood and then
you can also look for the frontpage

138
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:43,590
extensions and then these in points that
i was referring to and here's an example

139
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:51,000
of a where he's w get and we'll also
what i did i found some websites using

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,360
the view list and once i saw that once
those lister once was a sight show

141
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,339
I'll plug that site name in here and
then I do this w get and it'll download

142
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:08,709
all the documents basically actually in
this example it takes all the PDF

143
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:14,709
documents and all the sub directories
have sharepoint and a load them locally

144
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:22,449
to your disk drive or wherever you
choose to put them and this is that

145
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:28,359
powershell i was referring to earlier
where we can list all the data 1 through

146
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,449
X this is a function in powershell
basically where you can iterate through

147
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:41,050
the pages and then you pass the strength
to it here's the internet pages i

148
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:49,839
specify the site your own I say layouts
user ID is P . hey aspx and say one

149
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:58,029
through a hundred and then lists all the
users it finds one through a hundred i

150
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:03,040
was i was going to do a demo I then I
remember i'm going to hackers convention

151
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,889
and I don't really wanna expose myself
to the head to the network and if you've

152
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,189
ever liked to death if you have been to
DEFCON I mean I really don't recommend

153
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,769
you turn on your telephone

154
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:23,350
anyway this is an example i made i may
go ahead if we have time i may go ahead

155
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:30,040
and do some this but here's where I'm
going into google and then I type by in

156
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,110
your own and basically take this right
here and basically what it did its

157
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:42,550
listing all these sites that are
sharepoint sites and not only the

158
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,559
sharepoint sites are their anonymous so
if i do if i can click on any of these

159
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:57,879
like texas governor government i'm on
their sharepoint site in fact I on the

160
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,750
previous page i took one of those links
and clicked on it

161
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,470
and this is what I got so if you if you
sing sharepoint you know this is just a

162
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:14,370
SharePoint site i'm looking at all the
documents scripts templates images and

163
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,680
I'm on their site and that's kind of
pain to me that sounds really dangerous

164
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,829
because I go in here and click that sign
in and when i type that when i click on

165
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:34,800
sign in i can get a username password
prompt and at that point I've gone

166
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,990
through all the firewalls I've gone
through all the servers and now and now

167
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:46,170
i'm on the active directory answering a
username password problem and at that

168
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,699
point i can i can bring force usernames
and passwords

169
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:57,510
anyway that's um that was from this
previous site i mean when i did this

170
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:04,830
that you're all right there i click on
one of those links and then I got this

171
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,790
and for the most part you click on any
of those links and you you will see

172
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:14,520
sharepoint if I was if i wanted to
narrow it down further

173
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,040
I could put the last few letters like
Kim Il for military or government

174
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:27,300
government and then layouts and then I
see all the military installations that

175
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,880
have that extension is you

176
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:41,339
united states marine corps civilian
training army for the government

177
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,339
these are government sites like theirs
theirs earlier we saw Texas US Treasury

178
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:52,500
kind of scary that's and again all these
are anonymous sites that are being

179
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:59,610
pulled up and so here's an example i
clicked this the sign and when I did

180
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:07,170
that this was a charlotte county and i
got a username password prompt so I've

181
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,949
gone past all I've gone through all this
port

182
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:14,370
I mean all the firewalls I've gone
through all the servers and now i'm

183
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,928
talking to the active directory

184
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:23,220
so before I leave this one thing i would
suggest is whenever you set up anonymous

185
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,700
make sure you do it right and then also
you may not wanna be made you may want

186
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,909
to use some kind of other authentication
versus the Active Directory

187
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:37,409
authentication we use with the call
forms base

188
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:44,309
this right here is just a list of all
the different year olds that you can

189
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:48,450
search for it and what's interesting
about these girls are this there's many

190
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,549
different categories that you can look
at but like this first list of

191
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:59,429
categories these are all administrative
murals that you can search for and if

192
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:03,840
you can get to then you're actually
you're actually talking to the

193
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:12,330
SharePoint central admin and brush you
get here you're getting past a lot of

194
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:20,879
things this other this is SP disco i'm
not quite i'm a developer now but one

195
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:22,590
time this

196
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:29,549
these were web services or SharePoint
and . services like it i can access and

197
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:35,940
then after I can ask access and I could
I can then column pass parameter 2

198
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:43,440
parameters to it and then pull
information back or execute things and

199
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,369
when you when you do call it looks like
something like this again most of these

200
00:18:47,369 --> 00:19:01,678
are functions that are being called and
so going back to this w get there's a

201
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:09,149
there's a windows w get that I've style
called gnu windows 32 and then I went on

202
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:15,418
there and execute that script and what I
did that Henry had something like this

203
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:22,470
and basically what it did that that site
that i went to it basically downloaded

204
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,389
all the PDFs from there once i got the
PS I can you know start

205
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,600
searching their documents for other
information that i want to leave him out

206
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,959
of it

207
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,330
this show day and sites kind of
interesting because this also will how

208
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,850
much time always done

209
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:54,158
okay all right well uh that uh let me
just summarize let's go down to the end

210
00:19:54,159 --> 00:20:01,419

publishing these uh these uh the slide

211
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:08,529
deck and you know this information off
the slide deck that the final thoughts

212
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:12,730
is published your sharepoint correctly
make sure if you set up anonymous that

213
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:20,049
you lock it down make security a
priority within a sharepoint a pen test

214
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:23,080
your site in fact when you go back to
your office

215
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,799
make sure when you do that year old
thing make sure your site's don't show

216
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,190
up and if they do then you need to fix
it I wouldn't tell anybody

217
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:36,820
they showed up i fix it and then tell me
