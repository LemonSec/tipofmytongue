1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,870
alright we have a lot of slides
materials so since it's for we're gonna

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,190
go and get started right now hope
everybody's pumped to be here this is a

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,389
basic talk about internet 101 so if
everybody's excited we're going to

4
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,439
relate it and in broad concepts you
convey the internet to see so it's like

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,259
really big telephone lines James heads
up research risk IQ that's essentially

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,949
our hunt team and research team they
investigate exploits and they also

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,980
coordinate with law enforcement when we
find major campaigns need help doing

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,960
takedowns I work on the product side my
background as I built some the first

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,590
banking web apps that were really
insecure so I got to learn how to do

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,340
forensics and eventually became a source
code reviewer and pin tester

11
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,780
so who is here today for we get started
this office of the demos how many folks

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,070
here are some sort of system or
management level Rio oversee both red

13
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,690
and blue team activities

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:06,000
ok very cool how many of you are red
team pen testers are very few this year

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,490
that's even better given that we we had
to decide with the data whether we focus

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,759
more on investigations or more in
pentesting last year we mainly focused

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,930
on pin testing this year we made about
70-percent investigation so how many you

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,890
are blue team instant response forensics
awesome made the right bet how many of

19
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,550
you are here by accident

20
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:35,990
cool last year a lot more people by
accident so we have like 50 slides and a

21
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,429
whole bunch of demos to try to cram in
and I've had a lot of espresso so pardon

22
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,840
me if we go really fast so what this
presentation is about conceptually it's

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,120
really two sides for us to the of the
same data coin as one way to think of it

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,280
so on one hand we have data sets that we
use to track and observe bad guys who

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,140
are breaking into our customers using
security relevant internet data sets and

26
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,490
what we find is most those attacks for
us fall into one of two categories one

27
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,799
our recon based attacks they look for
gaps and security they can use to attack

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,910
or these impersonation based attacks
we're going to cover both of those the

29
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,260
second thing that we've learned in the
last year is that we can take those same

30
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,920
data sets and ttp and turn that back
around on our adversaries so we can we

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,119
can take the same TP and data and start
doing recon our adversaries and start

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,440
getting ahead of their next attacks
after we detect an initial one hopefully

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,370
there's some really cool stuff in there
will be able to show you representing

34
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,890
well okay so if you've been working in
infosec for a while and you've been

35
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,609
awake the last few years the attacks
were going to show are not going to be

36
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,190
new to you what we hope to show you
today that'll be new are the

37
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,239
relationships between these different
type of attacks and how to go deeper

38
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,340
into the adversaries infrastructure that
they launched attacks from and in this

39
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,500
part is really exciting because this is
the correlation of new data sets is what

40
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,640
we've spent the last year doing and
helping hunt down adversaries so in a

41
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,720
couple of examples we haven't used these
live examples before at a public

42
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,560
conference because some of these
adversaries are still very active one

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,830
also today is still out there kicking
people on the teeth i think three of

44
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,250
them are actually live adversaries and
we haven't wanted to tip off the

45
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,510
adversaries what we're actually doing to
track them so so we will today and

46
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,290
hopefully none of you are in the room
are the examples so

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,409
time check with four minutes in we're
doing good i'm not rambling from

48
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:40,510
espresso too badly so this is the flow
we're going to talk about today we made

49
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,500
a last-minute decision we're going to
combine six and seven we initially going

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,060
to have a whole separate piece on just
how to do investigations but we can't

51
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,140
cover all the content we want and have
an in-depth kind of hands-on session for

52
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,109
that so we're gonna walk you through
some live investigations as we go

53
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,560
through the attack types and then if you
want to see more hands-on just grab

54
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,140
James and I grab some hallway con come
by our booth our booth is like all sc's

55
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,899
this year and we can walk through like
in-depth how to correlate some of these

56
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,609
datasets so goals today show you the bad
guys what we found that are really doing

57
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,180
that works we believe it works because
our customers are telling us that works

58
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,320
and they keep doing it and they seem to
be monetizing it well give red team's

59
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,010
ideas example you can add your own bag
of tricks now I think most of stuff

60
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,789
we're gonna show today red teams are
already doing most of these but you

61
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:31,960
might find some new twists on this and
we want to show blue team's is most of

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,299
you hear how to go from a basic attack
allure beyond validating oh is this real

63
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,620
or correlating it to a threat actor to
actually going like what all is this

64
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,860
person up to and what are they likely to
do next where they going to come at me

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,729
are they targeting me all these kind of
questions so last year our presentation

66
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:57,070
was about the data so since most of your
investigators you should know most this

67
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:03,969
data the only data set that might be new
to you is technology components and by

68
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:10,090
that we mean stacks and by that I mean
you know any good system admin you know

69
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,549
has some kind of lamp stack or some
windows stack that they prefer some CMS

70
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:21,639
some bill we started finding adversaries
confer specifics tax as well it's one of

71
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,539
many pieces we can put together as
fingerprints to help map them out and so

72
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,800
last year we talked a lot about the data
and then we followed up with the teams

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,300
that were at the presentation we found
that nobody actually put the data we

74
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,780
laid out into practice in their red
teaming and the conclusion was it's not

75
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,059
really about the data it's about how to
fit into a pro

76
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,889
success so this year we're introducing a
number of additional data sets but we're

77
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:47,889
going to try to put it all together in a
way where you can see you can correlate

78
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,760
it all some of the new things are going
to talk about that we've introduced our

79
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,370
ssl certificates the value of who is for
tracking adversaries and and and

80
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,970
pivoting to find new attacks is
degrading overtime any sophisticated

81
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,200
adversaries using anonymous who is
registration so going forward we have to

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,680
find new ways to track them and one of
the most effective ways we found is

83
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,020
using a SL facets another one is host
pairing we started adding more down

84
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,639
capture and web crawling and finding the
relationships the Paulson frequency of

85
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,940
inner Lincoln us between hosts which can
tell us some interesting things will

86
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,110
show that later trackers is one of the
most exciting ones we started extracting

87
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,490
out of the Dom all these different
tracking IDs from you know are they

88
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,550
using new relic for performance
management are they using google

89
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,540
analytics or yahoo ads and so will show
you how you can start combining all

90
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,650
these new identifier zan exist in the
Dom to start mapping back two

91
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,849
adversaries and you can actually
classified by sophistication and then

92
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,419
the final one we're going to talk about
a little bit we haven't released this

93
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:54,039
dataset publicly we can teach you how to
build it but essentially we've also been

94
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,909
doing experimenting with Paige hashing
using machine learning so if you have a

95
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,960
group of global crawling capability you
can capture the Dom capture all the

96
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,560
headers capture the technology stack and
using something like men hashing you can

97
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,550
create a checksum tree and then you can
use those checksum streets to start

98
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,400
looking for fuzzy matching and
properties and we've been able to do

99
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,609
some some very accurate and effective
automated detection of adversaries new

100
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,500
attacks that don't look the same visibly
on the surface by by doing underlying

101
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,180
page hashing and header hashing and
matching of components blocks of

102
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,430
JavaScript code this sort of thing

103
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,490
well it's not about the data about using
it together so when we started studying

104
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,560
so after a presentation last year we
decided to

105
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,640
spend some time with some test teams
from Recon teams and so my group and

106
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
products been a lot of time in the field
working with people seeing how they went

107
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,479
about their day-to-day job what were
their ttp James his team in our data

108
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,950
science team started studying our data
on adversaries and what we came up with

109
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:05,680
is off this given data set that we see
used the use case was actually trying

110
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,430
modal and what I mean by try model is
simply that the largest datasets used we

111
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,630
typically by the blue team within an
organization but they're actually

112
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,830
slightly different datasets used by the
adversaries of doing recon and targeting

113
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,219
the organization that we would often
find blue team's didn't have leverage

114
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,350
and then we found red team's
additionally again used another subset

115
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,520
of the data is all these three groups
are operating on different subsets of

116
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,329
the same data which means they're going
to come to different conclusions and

117
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:46,840
naturally have some gaps so we want to
unify all this data and unified the data

118
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,250
would look like this

119
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:55,180
so these different datasets a lot of
times we find organizations can

120
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,160
everybody hear me without the mic hear
me at the back now some of you can some

121
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,240
of you can't this thing detachable make
it is now it's taped down

122
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:15,430
ok I'll speak really loud so of these
different pieces we found things like we

123
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,800
have found that brand usage brand
keyword usage even logo usage and copy

124
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,469
and uses great indicators of attacks
being set up and weaponized other

125
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,010
indicators of future attack and we found
that a lot of organizations will have

126
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,140
this data the marketing team and
sometimes the legal team might have some

127
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,030
domain infringement monitoring some
brand and logo reuse monitoring but in

128
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,560
most cases that data is not actually
shared or effectively accessible to the

129
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,888
security teams in the hunt teams
themselves and the same with

130
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:52,029
these other pieces like ssl certs we
found a bunch of orgs where the IT team

131
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:56,499
either internally or how to service that
they used to try to track all their ssl

132
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:59,589
certs globally and maintain an inventory
of them they don't share that stuff with

133
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:02,889
anyone and that's that's great
information and using to help map out

134
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:07,059
your own infrastructure and understand
your taxes to protect you know and then

135
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:11,709
likewise the the blue team sometimes
have this abuse box and fish list stuff

136
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:16,329
that the red team doesn't have someone
in marketing has official social media

137
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:19,899
profiles and what's allowed to be used
for corporate like image shots and all

138
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,660
that and the blue team usually doesn't
have that that's actually really

139
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,730
effective recon data so what we want to
pull all this data together and use it

140
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,259
essentially to reveal new associations
map out bad neighborhoods and for those

141
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:35,529
of you that don't know what we did we
were in process of doing this at Derby

142
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:40,480
con last year but we acquired passive
total and we put passive total which is

143
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,139
it's a free community edition product
for you use an investigation it's got a

144
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:48,309
you are you can just decrease the API
but we dropped it on top of our datasets

145
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:54,249
and where we're slowly exposing these
data sets out through passive total so

146
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:58,959
you can have access to them in the
community so let me give you a quick

147
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,998
example of what we can do with these
correlations and this is just purely

148
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:07,329
automated that we did ourselves you
could do this through three AP is these

149
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,888
datasets so the first thing was we had
an example of customer being attacked

150
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:18,339
and that they this particular adversary
is counterfeiting their goods so we've

151
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:21,579
got some logo detection we're looking
for logo

152
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:25,929
we're looking for keywords and we start
mapping out and we find some properties

153
00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:29,529
that are technology under the hood
starting with this top jordans which is

154
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,519
an impersonation site were capturing the
Dom all the web components the headers

155
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,319
this adversary favors this in car
platform there's 12 different cookies

156
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:42,699
those cookies map to some tracking
trackers the adversary uses we have

157
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,868
whois registration and some common
keywords we were able to break this out

158
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:51,850
and go out and we found literally
thousands and thousands of associated

159
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,079
sites over this multi-year history so
this adversary is a professional

160
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,020
counterfeiters

161
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,380
and they're constantly expanding out and
using new things and so we combine

162
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,280
passive DNS with who is with our
trackers to pivot out and i'll give you

163
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:11,060
a visualization of this so once we
mapped all this out essentially blue so

164
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,930
this gives you an idea of the depth of
what you can find combining this ID the

165
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,160
bulk of what we found when we say IP
that's passive DNS so a lot of this

166
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,839
historical stuff is dead so the bulk of
what we found was using passive DNS but

167
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,980
then using who is we're able to find new
domain spinning out pretty quickly and

168
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,400
then through trackers were able to find
even additional relationships and the

169
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,530
best thing about trackers is that also
told us where they were reusing old

170
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:41,000
infrastructure old IPS and stuff that
they popped in a new domain name on top

171
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,050
of and we're starting to run some new
campaigns whenever trackers are live you

172
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,770
know there's something live that's going
on there that's a threat that's a simple

173
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:58,490
way to visualize this time check with 15
minutes and ok so this gives you some

174
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,960
back down context for what we're trying
to do unify this data now let's talk

175
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,250
about the attack patterns so what we
have here are two different sets of

176
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,540
attack patterns and we broke this up one
is by frequency and it's purely

177
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:18,110
data-based so the first the first five
there's actually six here we popped in a

178
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,110
new one because we're seeing this
growing pretty rapidly and we thought as

179
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,160
investigators this will be an
interesting one for you but essentially

180
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,280
these are all based off data this is
data frequency these examples are based

181
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,510
off of pulse and that the frequency is
much lower we collected the second set

182
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,860
of data from running surveys and
interviewing CISOs so these are the

183
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,430
things that cause them the biggest
monetary impact or loss to their

184
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:46,430
organization they got compromised they
didn't know about

185
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,349
so this is mainly for the the red team
folks who wanted to show and this is the

186
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,340
this is the interesting stuff for the
blue team hunting i'm going to swap the

187
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,600
order so we can see how much time we
have for demos and given most people are

188
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,600
investigators in here i'm gonna roll
thru the week attack surface stuff

189
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,760
pretty quickly again that i don't think
this will be new to most of you

190
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,980
especially if your red team you should
know all these

191
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,020
but we've got five categories the only
one that has raised some eyebrows is

192
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:21,140
that we added in EU privacy regulations
the reason we add the men is because in

193
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,449
the EU privacy regulators have turned
into is far as our customers consider

194
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,430
nation-state adversaries there they're
deliberately targeting us businesses

195
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,420
operating in the EU for privacy
violations in a way that they don't

196
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,290
target you businesses are you customers
say oh we just get a slap on the wrist

197
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,890
for us customers say we get a six-figure
fine

198
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,370
so we've had customers are getting very
large fines that stack up into the high

199
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,660
six and seven figures which is a real
impact of Los termination state actor so

200
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:56,630
we're gonna go ahead and include them in
this the first example here is what we

201
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:01,280
like to call the pre owned company and
the pattern that we've seen which this

202
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,750
which the systems that brought this to
our attention of described we had 160

203
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,530
that became a new customer that this
happened twice too in her own one year

204
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,130
the company gets breached from the
inside how does this happen

205
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,630
they're kind of confused we we've got an
organization that has pretty

206
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:23,090
sophisticated perimeter defenses if
they've hardened things that got a good

207
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,390
hunt team they're really not easy to
break into and then all of a sudden

208
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,280
they've got actors from the inside they
start doing investigations and they have

209
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,329
new ingress and egress points that they
didn't know about and what happened is

210
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:40,520
the organization decided to go acquire a
company that companies often a a partner

211
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,790
they already have some network times and
relationships and that are filtered and

212
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,500
control what we've seen the pattern
that's been exposed is that once they do

213
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,310
the forensics investigations we
literally had cases we find that within

214
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:57,800
24 hours of the s4 document so you file
an s4 documents is a public document

215
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,819
after your letter of intention to
acquire when the s4 document goes public

216
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,120
we found organizations that have been
breached within 24 hours because these

217
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,530
these third-party partners in city areas
are usually very weakly defended they

218
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:13,880
might have one security guy so they go
breach them they've tunnel inside and

219
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,240
most of the breaches come through just
simply week web assets and weak web

220
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,089
servers and they tunnel inside they drop
their back doors and the negative

221
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,889
former and they just wait until they
start seeing new IP address ranges new

222
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:29,910
networks being advertised and then they
conclude oh now we're probably plugged

223
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,999
into the corporate parent and they use
that as a back door to tunnel then so

224
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:38,309
that's the first one the second one
third party hosted marketing campaigns

225
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:41,969
this one again if you read team that all
this is probably pretty obvious but it

226
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,379
grows really fast marketing budgets
don't align with IT budgets marketing

227
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,759
budgets are project-based IT budgets are
annual cyclical the market comes along

228
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,490
say we need 10 new servers friday
because we're gonna launch this new

229
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:59,009
campaign for XYZ 90 girls I we can't do
that and I like no problem that people

230
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:02,910
who are building our creatives have a
very expensive option that we can sign

231
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,039
up for to throw these up and rackspace
or some random hosting and and there to

232
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,069
throw them up on an old version of
WordPress and you know you can just set

233
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:16,740
your stopwatch to the breached and so so
this happens all the time and that's

234
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,270
even assuming that they let you know
then you know you know yet if the sex

235
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,859
usually doesn't know about its IT that
says like we don't have time for that

236
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,459
marketing goes well we can just go with
external hosting and it's--like great

237
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,690
piss off and you know and then all of a
sudden infosec gets the phone call and

238
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:40,049
this was another 1i had a guide a very
major online marketing firm the count

239
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,700
does this for a living

240
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,330
call me up around midnight one night
asking if we could get him some date on

241
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,960
this cuz marketing come running and
screaming they had a big campaign that

242
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,580
was collecting pii and it had been
breached and rpi was breached and he's

243
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,460
like we can't even figure out like they
don't even know where this is hosted

244
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,700
they just told the creative agency like
run with it and the creative agencies

245
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,120
not responding so we don't know where to
go we don't have to login get logs

246
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,979
anything and yet now they've got stuff
being disclosed so so that's that that's

247
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,309
the number to the number 31 and i expect
this will eventually outpace marketing I

248
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:19,139
think we just don't know how often the
number three is happening yet but it's

249
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,950
the new it's the new dev app in the
cloud it's the new test system that

250
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,360
somehow gets plugged into prod and we
see these all the time they're not there

251
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,959
hard to pick up with our traditional
ways we try to do recon on ourselves

252
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,299
because they're not in our existing apns

253
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:38,549
a SMS or IP address spaces and they're
often not tied to our existing domain

254
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:43,950
names they might be living on IP address
for now and so so the interesting thing

255
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:49,769
is last year when we did this we ran
some queries and we found examples of

256
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:54,869
65,000 test applications they were test
by we found dns entries in the cloud

257
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:59,730
that were like you know test and staging
. whatever that had associated code and

258
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:05,129
get cub that have hard-coded passwords
and config files or running default

259
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:08,699
passwords and configurations so you can
just correlate from the github to the

260
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,690
test thing and then you have the creds
so we know this is happening all the

261
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,700
time but it becomes kind of tricky for
organizations to find and so this became

262
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,059
a problem for one organization that
because the news that really want a name

263
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:30,720
but we can't they became such a problem
for the 60 that they started deploying

264
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,450
this route agent on all the boxes in the
enterprise that would look for AWS keys

265
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,840
and other cloud developer keys and api
keys and collect them and they would

266
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,529
pull them back to a central repository
then go log into all those cloud

267
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:47,789
properties crawler grab the code pull it
back to a central repository for other

268
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:51,869
four analysts to then go look at and try
to decide if it was a risk to the

269
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:52,980
business or not

270
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,190
well they already had an overloaded
infosec team and now the sea so created

271
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,419
this massive pile every test piece of
code and web pages out there for the

272
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,659
info SEC team to look at it go is this
allowed or not and we need to go pin

273
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:07,649
tested and so obviously that mission was
not successful but that shows you the

274
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:10,590
level of desperation for trying to
figure out how to track this problem

275
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:19,499
number 10 is outside of the purview of
the business is that IT starts playing

276
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:23,460
with you know they get into the
wonderful dev ops world and IT starts

277
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,029
playing with auto replication and
backups into the cloud without telling

278
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:33,659
anyone and and we can we share this from
personal experience we might have

279
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:39,509
discovered ourselves doing this late
last year so we know how common the pain

280
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:44,279
is we eat our own dog food using our
systems and so the way this way this

281
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:44,970
kind of work

282
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,120
saddest somebody goes okay I want to set
up this auto replication and they play

283
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,939
with all this they start spooling up
duplicates of everything in the cloud

284
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,450
they start to replicate data but all the
app servers are default passwords and

285
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,090
all the configs or default because no
one's gone through and done the

286
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,610
hardening they didn't replicate a
hardened system they're just playing

287
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,059
around with it to see if it works but
then they start testing data replication

288
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:10,408
and essentially now you have a backdoor
you have a backdoor into your production

289
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:14,940
systems and it only takes from what
we've seen about 48-72 hours before some

290
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,049
you know general sequel injection bot or
something that attacks an app server

291
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:22,200
with default passwords and configures
comes along and finds that thing they

292
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,429
know all the AWS I people in space so
they've got bots optimized and to

293
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:34,169
monitor and look for the sort of
deployments so the last one this was an

294
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,950
interesting one for us because it became
a major use case for our customers that

295
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,840
they were operating the EU they're
starting to get these six-figure fines

296
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,399
are adding up in the seven figures and
it's particularly challenging for

297
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,600
organizations that subsidiaries is very
common for us works to have independence

298
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,459
of city Aires that they own within each
individual country in the EU and then it

299
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,179
gets even worse if it's a franchise
model and a lot of the EU countries

300
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,809
because of privacy laws have all sorts
of reasons they they can't let you

301
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:07,020
centralize the data are they say they
can't share the data and there they can

302
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,580
be really difficult to do this so you
have to use public open source you know

303
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,720
who is passive DNS stated kind of build
the central database things go up and

304
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,919
down all the time

305
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,490
how do you find all these assets and
then you need a way to monitor them add

306
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,659
on level 4 change as well so you can
find out when people change our cookies

307
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:32,039
sort of things go on so conclusion from
this it's pretty obvious that based upon

308
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,760
these priests things as a common pattern
we don't have global asset visibility

309
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,658
and we don't have a way to monitor them
but it's not that hard to do if we have

310
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,169
the right data sets and the datasets for
most of this can be simply done with

311
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,070
passive DNS who is newly registered
domains is another really good one to

312
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,320
catch these and newly registered domains
I screwed up that bullet point actually

313
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,200
what you want on this one as you want
new host name right

314
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,950
solutions on existing domains and
there's a couple tools and ways to

315
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,980
capture that from inside your
organization but when people start going

316
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,809
to New hostnames so newly resolve
hostnames on existing domains that's a

317
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,309
great way to find like staging 3 .
whatever is now in the Amazon Cloud and

318
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,940
the resolving to externally and if you
want to know there's some free software

319
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,720
out there you can use to capture that
caption grab me after this and I can

320
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,370
point you in the direction of that you
need some global ipv4 scan data like a

321
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,149
showdown kind of thing so you can start
pulling all that in and then the hardest

322
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:31,779
thing to get is the kraal Dom data so
you need to be able to actually analyze

323
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:35,679
the Dom to pull a lot of this apart

324
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,529
ok time check 24 I think we're fine on
my eyes you could think i have the extra

325
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:42,880
espresso

326
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,389
alright so external threats

327
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:51,939
these are things we've detected that
adversaries are using externally to

328
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,870
Target employees or customers
predominantly it's shifting towards

329
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,010
employees and there's some common
patterns we're going to talk about in

330
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,970
this the reason we find these
interesting is they're all basically

331
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:09,820
forms of fishing wailing or we could
call it data theft many of these are

332
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,330
malware distribution attacks but
essentially the malware is really just

333
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,789
again going back to its either stealing
creds are looking for PIR ph I which is

334
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:22,690
the goal of all the phishing attacks and
what's been kind of fascinating to us is

335
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:28,389
there's been this there's like a bumper
crop of products that have spun out to

336
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:32,139
address each of these things
individually there's like mobile-only

337
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:37,959
vendors and social media only vendors
and targeted spearfishing you know and

338
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,899
people focusing on domain infringement
and if you assemble the right data sets

339
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,500
it's all the same problem there's
actually very little uniqueness to all

340
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,019
these different attacks and that's what
we're going to try to break down today

341
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:53,350
so

342
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,709
but I mean at it

343
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,990
how many of you know who the groc is
going well okay i figured more the room

344
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,559
would I could guy who wrote one of the
first anti forensics tool kits and got

345
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:09,668
fired from at stake and went on
independently and he sees the groc on

346
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,030
twitter is a great twitter feed for info
sex for either one of the best out there

347
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:18,549
especially for forensics and
investigations really sharp dude on on

348
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:23,770
blue teaming stuff and you know he just
said i started this year he said like

349
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,240
you know

350
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,730
fishings back to number one again we've
like raise the technology barrier and we

351
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:36,010
made it harder to exploit like Windows
10 and we've made you know 20 days more

352
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,429
valuable to keep in reserve for nation
state actors and the one thing that

353
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:44,169
never changes and you never liked burner
get old by using his fishing and he's

354
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:47,409
like once once you know how to fish
you're in and i'll let you

355
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:54,669
yeah i mean so obviously coming from a
research background you know we we do a

356
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:58,720
ton of hunting inside the product we do
a lot of stuff with customers things

357
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,760
like that and really what we've seen is
just consistently the attacks have

358
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,360
gotten simpler they become more
effective in some of these cases

359
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:14,379
anti-phishing is not very sexy you know
stopping zero-days stopping at you know

360
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,490
vulnerability exploitation and things
like that is really kind of the sexy

361
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:24,340
stuff and yet it's a million times
easier to actually fish somebody and ask

362
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,629
them for their credentials

363
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,760
we've got things like two factor auth
that are coming into play and it's

364
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,429
starting to help in certain situations
but you know if Fischer's if somebody's

365
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,580
gonna actually input their password into
a web page

366
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:43,360
what makes you think that they're not
going to put a two factor auth code in

367
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,559
that same damn webpage and you know so
we have to kind of look at some of these

368
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:53,649
and figure out what the best approaches
on these it and the other thing is you

369
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,850
know honestly these guys are building
out real scalable applications are

370
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,740
targeting multiple brands they're doing
it at consistent and scalable manner

371
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,330
what we're seeing is the same analytic

372
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,820
tools that we use as you know regular
companies they're using because they

373
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,019
want to improve their effectiveness to
and they're kind of like why should I

374
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:20,610
build that myself when I could just go
to any of these analytics places and and

375
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,789
we find a lot of that is really really
interesting because we can start

376
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:30,149
pivoting off of that I'm some of the
other stuff that is really interesting

377
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:36,029
to us is they're using cloud stuff just
the way that we would you know they're

378
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,760
standing stuff up very rapidly and
shutting it off

379
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,620
they're not using as much you know
compromised infrastructure as they were

380
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,449
the dedicated stuff they might use it
for some sort of redirection or initial

381
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:53,130
landing page or you know stuff like that
but some of the more advanced guys are

382
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,029
actually like setting up a dedicated
infrastructure there they're setting up

383
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:01,529
dedicated domains are setting up
dedicated IP space and there's like

384
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:05,610
actually some sophistication going on
and there's definitely some innovation

385
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:11,820
that we're seeing on the simpler side of
attacks in two areas . i mean you know

386
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,850
if you look at the attack surface these
days you know windows 10 OS 10 all these

387
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,049
different operating systems are making
successful exploitation a much more

388
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:28,860
difficult you know effort and a lot of
times you know if you have that system

389
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,969
actually set up where you need to be
like it's actually secured and hardened

390
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,149
it's they're not simple targets like
these two

391
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:41,070
I mean gone are the days of being able
to run into a place and pop 50 shells

392
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,740
within five minutes I mean I love those
days I you know I didn't love defending

393
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:53,820
it but it was pretty fun we go into that
so I mean to be really clear what's

394
00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:00,510
interesting is that where we actually
seen the sophisticated adversaries have

395
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:07,200
actually been adopting DevOps build
tools and auto replication at a faster

396
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,029
rate than many large organizations have
so they're actually outpacing them at

397
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:15,450
dynamically copying we've seen
adversaries that automatically

398
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,850
completely clone

399
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,060
perfect copies of websites and under 15
minute intervals

400
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,320
they've got active monitors running they
pull all the code and they rebuild it

401
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,500
change the past pump it out they move it
around a raise of domains they have

402
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,030
large TDS is we have separate
presentations about their tds networks

403
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,330
and infrastructure if you want to learn
more about that we don't have time to go

404
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:42,889
too in depth on that today but
regardless to say they're they're taking

405
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,910
advantage of the low cost of cloud and
all the software that our business is

406
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:52,880
embracing to lower the cost of
deployment replication and performance

407
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,450
and they're leveraging it setup very
complex threat infrastructure so I'm

408
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:03,110
going to take a simple example today so
so this is basically i'm not sure what

409
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:09,409
language this in but this perfect its
profile google this is a fish

410
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,870
this is a fish that automatically this
guy's fish all just automatically copy

411
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,540
google stuff so whatever google makes a
change

412
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,620
he's automatically building it in and
including it and what's interesting

413
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,909
about so so how did we catch this i'm
going to cheat a little here i'm going

414
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,820
to show you how you can catch this but i
want to show you something interesting

415
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,490
here first us so the way we initially
caught this was actually using page

416
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:39,560
caching which I mentioned earlier and so
when we first saw this thing we

417
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,520
decompose dit all the headers all the
components everything in the Dom we

418
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,300
decompose it into a min hash tree so
it's basically a tree check sums and

419
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,980
then we ran it against our global
database is check songs and and this one

420
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,970
usually we don't get this clear of a hit
we run we use machine learning and the

421
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,140
algorithm we found that has been one of
the most successful we usually combined

422
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,730
outruns the machine learning for
analysis but in this case d wkn which is

423
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,970
distance waited nearest neighbor was
actually a fairly simple machine

424
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,630
learning algorithm is one of the most
effective with men hashing for auntie

425
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:19,550
fishing because we're comparing these
checks on trees and so with DW KNN what

426
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:24,020
we're doing is were becoming whole
database and say return the nine nearest

427
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,170
neighbors return the 10 nearest
neighbors like what things have the

428
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:30,980
closest matches so it's not much
different than a decade ago with how r

429
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,580
flake first published and introduced
with comparing families of malware

430
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,780
samples using checksum tree analysis the
same thing we're doing on the web in

431
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,980
this case when we return the nine
nearest neighbors we usually have a

432
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,520
weight it's like well or the first four
bad something like this in this case all

433
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,540
nine-match known active fishing
campaigns even though the webpages

434
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,420
visually at all nine others look
entirely differently

435
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,750
there's enough shared componentry and
check sums that it's like ok this was

436
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,680
obviously a fish but actually let's
let's dig in a look at this

437
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:16,610
so there's some cool stuff and this one
this is gonna be so annoying to drive

438
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,560
and multi window

439
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:29,870
alright so now we'll look at the data
set here and so the first thing we can

440
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:34,820
see is that I need to window resize here
we go

441
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:40,010
alright so so what does the data tell so
the first thing we're looking at here is

442
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,590
passive DNS data so we can see this guy
did a few tests here to see if you would

443
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,580
get any hits on this probably had some
success so this campaign is really knew

444
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,210
it hasn't run for very long so this is a
brand-new new fish we've got is what

445
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:58,310
passive DNS data is telling us but let's
let's move on and let's look at who is

446
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:03,710
so who is records we've got I usually
like to use email name and phone number

447
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,520
because there's about the only things
with uniqueness let's look at what we

448
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,230
have here okay we see a pattern really
quick here with we don't know if this

449
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,070
guy's target it doesn't look like it to
me this looks like a just a generic

450
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:21,439
scammer and whoever this scammer is he
clearly likes profile type attacks has

451
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,630
makes these fake update your profile
things that's his phishing scam what we

452
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:32,240
can also see from here is let's pop over
from who is so if we actually query

453
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,510
his name we can see using some different
email addresses too so we can start

454
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,440
picking off the different email
addresses and we can come over here oh

455
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,910
yeah he's got some other accounts there
but now I want to do something else I

456
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,710
want to come over here and now i want to
look at the web components and compare

457
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,000
so if I did have some doubts or
confusion is this is this real or

458
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,710
legitimate or not this is a very
rudimentary but effective example i'm

459
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:03,170
fairly sure none of Google's properties
are running SP dotnet deprecated version

460
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:07,610
of four on is 75 I think we can
confidently say that's not not Google's

461
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,389
technology stack so with some very basic
data sets like this combined you can

462
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,990
very quickly make a lot of decisions
just move on like we don't have to pasco

463
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,810
now we know there's all sorts of
indications of badness its generic

464
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,759
scammer and so now we can just go back
and let's find everything I think that's

465
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,720
another example we probably won't get to
today yeah so now we can just go back

466
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,168
and take all the different things we've
mapped out on all those different email

467
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,929
addresses block it all at once no reason
not to

468
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,310
and we can even go drill into all the
passive DNS IP addresses and see what

469
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:44,389
else is associated with them if we have
time which we don't today so 35-45 let's

470
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:52,040
go back to go back to PowerPoint you to
death

471
00:34:52,040 --> 00:35:02,060
we do have more examples wrong were all
right so so-called wailing domain

472
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:07,549
infringement wailing attacks and some
people referring to him as spearfishing

473
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,720
but the pattern we notice wailing
attacks again it goes back to this what

474
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,600
I called impersonation so the first
phishing attack most phishing attacks

475
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,020
you some form or usually multiple forms
of impersonation

476
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,030
so the whaling attacks and almost all of
them that we've seen use some form of

477
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,900
domain infringement and it's usually
pretty easy to detect domain

478
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,650
infringement and these are easy to pick
up if you add in the data set up new the

479
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:36,109
observed domains if you have a mature
organization by default newly observed

480
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:36,799
domains

481
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,250
that infringe your collide on your
namespace your spidey senses should

482
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,290
automatically be tingling your business

483
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,800
mature businesses this . don't usually
go out start registering a bunch of new

484
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,430
domains at once but adversaries do but
we can also correlate a few other

485
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,609
datasets are gonna show you here to
answer some other questions

486
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:57,230
am i targeted like this just a shotgun
spammer like I'm going to block all that

487
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,130
profile dude stuff but I'm not too
worried right he's not really targeting

488
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,690
me it's probably more my customers then
my employees my employees are gonna go

489
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:10,220
to facebook profile update and put in
their company password a block at all

490
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:13,520
but it's like I'm gonna waste any time
on it here i wanna know okay do I need

491
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,080
to worry about this how sophisticated as
this adversary do i need to flag them do

492
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,370
i need to put monitors on these datasets
to see when they set something new up

493
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:27,740
and how many ways we can try to come for
me so actually when on this one we

494
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,910
actually had a CFO I can't give you the
live example for some obvious reasons

495
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:36,230
but i'm going to give you an almost
identical example and this one that i'm

496
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:41,270
going to show you is alive active he's
both a targeted Fisher and a whaler he

497
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:47,930
goes after executives and so the same
exact pattern we had a CFO get well as a

498
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,129
payroll scam

499
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,330
hey you're not going to make payroll you
know the corporate accounts frozen we

500
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,720
need you to come unlock it you're gonna
have to transfer in this into this

501
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,950
account to show you have funds we need
to login here bubble they wailed the CFO

502
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:06,799
they figured out that it was a they got
owned and so they called us and

503
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,150
literally while we were there on-site
investigating this they got wailed again

504
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:16,160
they targeted another exact and so let's
look at this they were trying to

505
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,779
correlate all this by hand

506
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,980
it's kind of crazy so that the funny
thing is this guy this guy sites are

507
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:28,310
actually that sophisticated but he is
auto replicating code off these

508
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,730
different banks so that that this
particular domain that we started with

509
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,380
this particular whale attack came from
this targeting exact from this pnc

510
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,470
online banking mobile personal mouthful

511
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,390
let's find it is

512
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,140
it's over

513
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,549
alright so once again there's some
things we can tell immediately

514
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:05,660
this guy's been added a long time so is
this is this a new attack so this

515
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,549
started earlier this year so depending
on what you consider new it is newer but

516
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,010
it's not a brand-new attacked and just
start this weekend

517
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,220
this guy's been added a while but i'll
actually let's look at some more stuff

518
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:24,020
to see if we can figure out on this case
and I really like this guy because he's

519
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:29,810
still active but who knows if that's his
name but this guy is really consistent

520
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,920
about using the same name and email
address on a lot of different campaigns

521
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,820
eventually is gonna figure out an
anonymized this who is but there are

522
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,770
already enough internet space junk out
there that can be used to track him that

523
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,820
it's like a little bit too late now if
who is goes away and you know where to

524
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:51,980
go so let's look at let's start going
through this so the first thing we do is

525
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,960
if we pivot off

526
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,930
whois records on his email address we
see there's a hundred fifty-three

527
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,839
results and we can look through and all
we're going to find here is just the

528
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,040
same email address different things now
when we first look at this this doesn't

529
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,630
look targeted right this looks like a
generic Fisher scammer I mean we got we

530
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:14,150
got everything from password cracking to
Adele album to live sports to some sort

531
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:23,930
of iCloud calm this guy really likes the
dash com.com so we're going to come in

532
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:27,379
and we're going to pick off his name and
we see off his name we actually find a

533
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,610
slightly different set of data then
we'll keep it off his email and we see

534
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:37,280
some weird shit . net so i don't know if
it can you in the back

535
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,630
read any of these domains to say okay
literally the first domain registered to

536
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:47,480
his name is weird shit . net that's
since the not very funny joke i like to

537
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,400
go with obvious so so we found some
stuff there that makes us think this guy

538
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,370
isn't really targeted he's been running
this for a while but i don't have to

539
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,759
worry too much right I'm not going to
sweat it but there's something else we

540
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,590
saw when we came in here and that's we
identified that this guy uses google

541
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,640
analytics now there's two ways that this
can go and we got 10 minutes left so i'm

542
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,640
going to speed up less sophisticated
adversaries that our auto cloning and

543
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,520
replicating websites will clone all the
trackers the New Relic ID the google

544
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,570
analytics idea the yahoo ads ID they
will clone it all off the legitimate

545
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:28,010
site so when you find a copycat fishing
site that's got the illegitimate

546
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:33,320
trackers but there are like . are you
host in Russia a you know okay

547
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,990
bank of america is probably not
operating a lot of campaigns in Russia

548
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:39,890
that's a fish and to this this person
isn't real brighter sophisticated

549
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:45,109
because they just copied everything that
allows us to detect it really quickly in

550
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,400
this case though this guy drops all the
trackers and he uses his own so he pulls

551
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,880
in all the web components but he has his
own tracking ID and so let's go in and

552
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,880
look at that and see if we can learn a
little more here

553
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:03,650
I cannot mouse this way who jumped ahead
so let's look at his google analytics

554
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:09,110
account so this specific google
analytics account has 23 records and

555
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:14,360
what we notice about the 23 records
every one of them is targeting pnc bank

556
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,210
so now my spidey senses just went up a
notch again

557
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,800
ok this guy has a lot of shit out there
but this is actually targeting pnc is

558
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,000
clearly going after him so now let's
look at the individual IDs so what I

559
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,750
started finding as if i go through so
i'm looking at Google Analytics ID 51

560
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:33,440
and then here's 15 i just started
brute-force buzzing through google

561
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,790
analytics IDs he actually separates out
domains by structural patterns and

562
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:41,900
assigns them to individual google
tracking account IDs to track them

563
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,430
separately for some reason I don't know
why but now this is applying a level of

564
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,759
sophistication and targeting I gotta
worry about this guy and he's running

565
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,180
these at different time frames if you go
back and look at passive DNS and heat

566
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,200
map them you'll see him go live shut
things down this is a this is an

567
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,040
adversary we need to keep an eye on and
get ahead of and we can continue to keep

568
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,180
giving off of this now the other thing i
did that was interests

569
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:08,558
thing is so I went in to one of these
and i found i started going through the

570
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,119
individual domains and i found new
google accounts on some of them so he

571
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,950
has more than one google analytics
account so I came in here off the ones

572
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:21,520
to see you can find on this PN C dash
online at mobile that's banking that's

573
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,270
personal

574
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,200
he's got two different accounts into
different tracking ID so I dropping the

575
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,189
other google enix account and guess what
he's got another set of domains

576
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,720
targeting pnc bank so the rabbit hole
just goes deeper and deeper but using

577
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,259
this you can go way beyond who is and
you can do the same thing with that's a

578
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:44,140
self assets as well and i do not have an
example of those so we we are going to

579
00:42:44,140 --> 00:43:07,000
try to wrap this up in seven minutes
which means come on all right what do we

580
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,500
know about social media attackers are
rapidly embracing its actually outpacing

581
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,059
mobile and social media again the
attacks are fishing why why do we think

582
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:21,730
this is hence the graphic social media
has the largest concentration of users

583
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,990
at the distribution choke point and it's
also a distribution choke point that

584
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:32,649
provides the adversaries with sentiment
analysis i love wells fargo starbucks

585
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,430
sucks the adversary already has a
context now you approach you and engage

586
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:36,940
you

587
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,540
plus they have all sorts of information
they have your target they have

588
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,290
starbucks logos keywords all this
information about them and use so now

589
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:49,450
they can combine that very effectively
an awesome stalkerish way so you get

590
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,259
this immediate exposure they can also
use hashtags the campaigns are faster

591
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,540
than regular fish regular fish campaigns
we see last an average about 32 hours we

592
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,779
see about five to eight hours on social
media and the reason why is because so

593
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,109
many social media sites are weakly
authenticated so they can just automate

594
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:09,130
bulk creating and dumping new accounts
very rapidly in fact i think some of the

595
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,520
social media that don't how to monetize
as well actually like that extra user

596
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,609
volume of air traffic but that's
speculation the two biggest things we

597
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:16,560
see are fake

598
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,680
summer service hey I'm sorry your mad at
us

599
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,940
did you know we have a 24-hour service
guarantee i'd like to correct your

600
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,540
problem but first I'm going to need to
collect a little information from you

601
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,500
could you log into your account so we
can get started click here right and

602
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,010
some of its they've got this automated
down what feels like bot level and the

603
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,100
second one is hey we're glad you liked
this year the thousands customer to say

604
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,330
i love Starbucks you know what we'd like
you to do is you click here and download

605
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:47,549
your free gift card so so these two
things again our fishing the pattern

606
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,720
though is both attacks will use links
that lead back to the same thread

607
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,379
infrastructure they using web fishing
and actually the same links that they'll

608
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,190
use in mobile fishing when they siphon
off data and i'll give you a quick

609
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:00,690
example of this

610
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,280
this was from customer service here and
then I'm going to blow through internet

611
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:12,000
are you James so we have time to get
through this this is the last one of

612
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:21,810
these mouse get up here so the links to
this one basically led back to login

613
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,810
your account so we need to get some data
to help you out with the fake customer

614
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:29,640
support so again this is an and this is
no different than what we see with

615
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,940
traditional web fishing or with the
targeted wailing all this I've got this

616
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,210
account it's pretty straightforward I
come in I can see it's been running a

617
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:42,270
while I look through this guy once again
looks like a pretty that this guy has 14

618
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,200
almost 1,500 domains so he's a pretty
active broad-scale shotgun scammer

619
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,279
doesn't seem to target yet we have these
targeted social media accounts we come

620
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,110
in and now i'm giving off his name's
Danny email address has 3,000 more

621
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:59,010
records and and so from this now you can
parse through and you can start finding

622
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,970
has a bunch of different email addresses
now we have to come pivot off all the

623
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:07,470
different email addresses here this
email alone as another 2400 records so

624
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:12,089
we start doing this combined pivoting
but using the data sets again we found

625
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:16,770
this one has three and four results so
he has all these randomized generated

626
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:21,390
domains James thinks therefore old scams
we can discount this is trying to figure

627
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:22,819
out if he's at EDS

628
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,840
phone number now here's where it gets
kind of interesting again the google

629
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,570
analytics changes the story

630
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:34,820
this guy's not only targets pnc bank but
he targets capital one and into it and a

631
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,550
couple other things but it's
predominantly banks there's chasing

632
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:43,430
their there's 25 results i drop through
the records and now I go oh yeah this

633
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:47,509
guy does run Cargill campaigns when I
say guy this is probably a team of

634
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:51,980
people probably some cyber criminals
that are monetizing so long and short as

635
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,650
you go through the different tracking
ideas you'll see they'll break up the

636
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,610
groups of domains and run individual
tracking campaigns targeting specific

637
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,600
institutions so it's probably group of
threat actors putting this together and

638
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,360
the only funny thing is so I went
through the web components to see if we

639
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,490
could sort out and i actually found this
adversaries their stacks the technology

640
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:14,990
stacks they use are almost identical to
capital one because capital one cares to

641
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,930
use everything in the kitchen sink on
their web stacks

642
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:22,100
the only difference was this adversary
keeps their word press patched and

643
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:26,210
up-to-date when I went to the actual
capital one infrastructure they were

644
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:29,420
actually running all these legacy
deprecated versions of WordPress which

645
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,070
was pretty funny to me

646
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:39,380
probably not to them ok James i am going
to i think it from the nods and the

647
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,440
people leaving the room I think
everybody gets the idea that these are

648
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,090
all the same I always going to sound
mobile hear you're really targeted or

649
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:51,380
not that's why all these mobile vendors
are evaporating and give you an example

650
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,760
like halo for some reason the one most
targeted brands on the internet there's

651
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,600
almost 4,000 road mobile applications
out there you know where some people

652
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,680
have none it's like one of these very
polarizing you're either targeted you

653
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,259
aren't wrapped up James

654
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,760
yes so when the other huge things that
we run into time in our dataset

655
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,100
obviously we do a lot of anti add fraud
Manti you know targeted attacks inside

656
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:22,250
the advertising space so we see a ton of
that data you know most of its you know

657
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:26,660
at this point like i said before they're
trending towards low tech stuff so

658
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:31,069
they're doing scams they're doing you
know fix software things like that

659
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,550
we're seeing a lot less of the
traditional exploit kits things like

660
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:40,140
that in our data and really one of the
things that's interesting about the ad

661
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:45,960
ecosystem is how complex is if anyone
has any questions by all means you know

662
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,670
come back to us

663
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:51,270
I can talk to you around the booths you
know probably four hours on the app

664
00:48:51,270 --> 00:49:00,360
ecosystem but yes I know but one thing's
on the advertising side you know we cts

665
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:05,640
is used almost every single time there's
all sorts of traffic distribution you

666
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,560
know there's trappers and there's an
entire underground ecosystem related to

667
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,360
this stuff you know ucbrowser lockers
that are very common you know this is

668
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:20,550
just an example of when the old NSA
browser lockers you know really really

669
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:25,320
awesome English that's in there i highly
recommend checking out some screenshots

670
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,190
at some point but when the other
interesting things is the third party

671
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,970
web components we've seen a ton of
people targeting that stuff just

672
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:37,830
consistently they're popping web servers
they're trying to pull in user

673
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,319
credentials and things like that one of
the biggest issues that we're seeing

674
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:46,710
back to the fishing is so many people
reuse their passwords password reuse is

675
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,640
one of the biggest issues that us as
security practitioners are facing

676
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:57,060
because all it takes is one user to give
their password up it takes a forum dump

677
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:01,230
you know where there's you know tons of
passwords in there they can breathe

678
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:06,720
force that stuff no problem you know and
honestly all it takes is one week

679
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,520
website you know if they're storing
stuff unencrypted today we had the yahoo

680
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,990
breach you know where there was a ton
like 500 million accounts and how many

681
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,200
of those people do you think actually
reuse their password i'm willing to

682
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,930
guess that a large percentage actually
do here on that sound so it should be

683
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:29,490
really clear here we actually started
seeing the first indications of

684
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:35,009
targeting third-party components by
multiple routes for CD ends we saw

685
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:38,050
threat actors specifically going after
CDNs because then

686
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:42,430
like a 12 a thousand multiplier content
you can get after and then they would

687
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:46,720
just change a little bit of contents to
start sourcing in their attacks and and

688
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,930
now we started seeing of targeting
third-party widgets can be marketing

689
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,500
like Alec well that sort of thing but
the main thing is minute most of these

690
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,710
things are outside the scope of the red
team especially these third-party

691
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:00,370
vendors like alaqua so none of that
stuff's getting tested but it's getting

692
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:03,759
sourced in and built into your dog it's
part of your application and it

693
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,760
manifests itself at runtime but it's
usually out of the scope of everything

694
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,200
the red team's do

695
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:13,569
yeah and all scanners won't ever see
this and and that's an important thing I

696
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:18,160
mean oftentimes you know these
components are never in scope as far as

697
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:28,270
assessments go are no timelines whether
were like two minutes two minutes and

698
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:32,620
we'll roll through this real quick so
this is actually a really interesting

699
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,470
attack that we've seen recently

700
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:39,430
we're going to be putting a blog post
out on this probably monday or tuesday

701
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,509
sometime around then but basically what
people have been doing is they've been

702
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:46,090
talking targeting online shopping carts

703
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:50,590
I'm sure if anyone here is worked with
ecommerce sites opencart and things like

704
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:53,560
that you guys probably were just rolling
your eyes

705
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:58,150
there's so many vulnerabilities it's
like the wordpress of the shopping cart

706
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:03,190
world but really what's interesting to
us is the attackers have actually gone

707
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:08,410
to different lengths and they've been
starting to attack the client that's

708
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:12,580
connecting rather than server itself so
they're what they're doing is client

709
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:19,000
injections into the webpages grabbing
the forms and then basically posting

710
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,490
that an actual trading the credit card
data on that stuff we've seen a ton of

711
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:28,750
these websites that have been there and
I'm really sorry that the text is tiny

712
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:33,430
anyone that wants to talk to me
afterwards I can share screenshots and

713
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:37,450
things like that but basically what
they're doing is they're injecting their

714
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:42,480
this piece of JavaScript that looks like
legitimate javascript and

715
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,790
and basically what they're doing is so
on this one

716
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,660
what they're doing is checking for form
data they're checking to see what sort

717
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:58,230
of software is running they're pulling
the credit card feels as soon as the

718
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:04,530
data submitted and then they're pulling
that data / you know different different

719
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:10,650
a couple different ways but we've seen
some really interesting websites that

720
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:16,410
have been popped there's a ton of like
we saw one that was a bank their

721
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:22,830
internal store it got popped through
this and kind of interesting so anyone

722
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,049
that's interested in this feel free

723
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,920
sorry i don't have enough time to really
go through this but feel free to hit me

724
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,920
up afterwards and when we can share
share more information

725
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,819
you know the bottom line is that same
attack again they're essentially

726
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,900
rewriting the temple to the JavaScript
structure to answer key loggers and grab

727
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,260
data and what they have to send it
somewhere so if we go back to our

728
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,690
passive DNS who is what new host hands
what do domain names my connecting to

729
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:52,320
and sending data to if I'm managing my
back surface and I maintain it that way

730
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,640
and all of a sudden I see some new third
parties that I've sending data to and I

731
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,990
can go to start investigating them and
by combining these datasets it should

732
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:05,520
take you long to automate looking at and
go oh it's red and . are you again or

733
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,360
this is going to these things with these
google analytics not related us etc etc

734
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,860
therefore pivot point you should
immediately go like oh this is way bad i

735
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,930
need to shut this down immediately thank
you all for coming
