1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
alright we're ready

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,460
so this year's theme are recharged
spawned off from last year when we

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,940
started we started there behind me you
know that when you first walk into the

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,650
hyatt and the smell before we all get
here and then I'm just getting over fun

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,400
but you know when we leave here we
always felt recharge like you know hey

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,519
we can go on and tackle things and do
things better and that's the reason why

7
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,750
this year's theme was here and so you
know we're looking at other keynotes who

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,590
better to have then I you know two
individuals that have dedicated a lot of

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,670
their time and effort the spawning you
know a whole different vertical that a

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,360
lot of us now are experts in both from
everything from being assist admin all

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,379
the way to security researchers all the
way to know on you know being an office

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,940
and defenses and securing ourselves and
so like to introduce just over as well

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,579
as Ali homes who are from microsoft and
Jeff is is essentially the founder of

14
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,579
PowerShell so

15
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,740
also known as the father of power show
right that's how I much preferred over

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,520
the grandfather basket and happy about
that i was going to make any old jokes

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,300
today so i take it good and you know
lately as well offer my contributions

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,780
standpoint and skyrocketing power shown
what we do from a contribution but

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,540
they're known for a lot more and a lot
better a lot of things they work on a

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,680
Microsoft but their dedication i mean
power so just won't open source and and

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,640
I get up now so that was amazing so good
one on linux I know when I first got

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,220
there the first thing I did was get
powershot linux and then remove power

23
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,890
show from linux but good but it's one of
those things where you know and somebody

24
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,610
that you know uses it on a daily basis
both for office defense the kind

25
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,429
contributions they made on to this
industry is is great i'd like to

26
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,760
introduce them to derby county and give
a warm welcome for opening keynote

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,760
thanks Johnny basically

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:06,320
electrifying so how do you i'm jeffrey
silver I'm microsoft technical fellow

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,859
and I'm just thrilled to be here at my
first derby con yeah

30
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,130
hey I'm Ali homes and my security
architect at microsoft and Dave thanks

31
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,630
for the introduction it's really an
honor to be here everybody says that but

32
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,280
it's true this is this is der beek on
right like where you go to bark on and

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,330
and the talks are often as good as the
stuff that you see and you go to lobby

34
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,769
khan and it's awesome you go outside and
every single conversation is electric

35
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,720
the one thing I got a caution you about
if you go to bourbon con can still be

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,400
some bad news might be praying to the
porcelain gods there so watch out you

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,340
know what and it's the words getting
around it's not our little secret

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:56,660
anymore so three years ago Toby sold out
in three weeks of this year was 12 hours

39
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:03,019
that that kind of excitement is
unbelievable but it is so well deserved

40
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:08,390
so when they asked a question before how
many people had are here for their first

41
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:16,458
time was with her for the first time
this this crowd the way that we bring

42
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,750
the this crowd in is by welcoming them

43
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,549
welcome to the family you're in for a
treat so rather than try to explain how

44

56
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:22,640
working pieces but here's the final

we had a huge team this year and it was
an awesome competition everybody i did

59
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,570
an excellent job but we thought that
with other people then we couldn't have

60
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:50,540
it so there was no johnny has appt we
thought that is your HSN hour

61
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,940
yeah

62
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,810
so ladies and gentlemen due to their
kindness and generosity of that CTF team

63
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,440
that won the CTF they work their buns
off only to donate the fruits of their

64
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,840
labor back and if that doesn't exemplify
unity and and just being in the right

65
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,200
place the right people the right time I
don't know what does that's that's

66
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,200
bloody awesome so thank you and give
them a big hand please

67
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,810
you know you ever go to Burning Man and
when you walk into give you how can go

68
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,620
welcome home

69
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:40,880
well hello so anyway I have a black
patch $1,000 $1,500 will give me two

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:51,680
thousand dollars for every 3750 going
what I've got 3750 i have five thousand

71
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,680
dollars from the man with the porn stash

72
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,480
wait stop it costs six thousand dollars
to run the hackerspace for an entire

73
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,470
year

74
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:14,650
let's make it happen thought six
thousand dollars we have the hackerspace

75
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:34,630
for an entire damn year off one item one
I know what here is that what if you

76
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:40,570
have I have 6750 is anybody else care to
add to our pit

77
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,830
okay ladies and gentlemen we have come
to a conclusion after hours of wrangling

78
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:53,530
argument discussion to face it we have
decided and this is a Dave that we are

79
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:59,919
giving for the princely sum of seven
thousand dollars they're each gonna get

80
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,130
a black badge and we're gonna run the
hackerspace for two-plus years

81
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,060
I

82
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,550
you are

83
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,818
so I see some cult of glowing rectangle
sitting down there and get my hand

84
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:47,820
so those badges they went for seven
thousand dollars each and in case math

85
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,650
isn't your strong point that's not
approval attempt to get the next couple

86
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,909
years of derby for free that's 47 years
of tickets

87
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,110
I can't even imagine what we're gonna be
doing in 47 years but i'm sure that

88
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,150
Derby is going to be epic

89
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:09,150
Dave no no pressure there so from that
auction and the generosity of people

90
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,870
like this in this room the the
hackerspace of uganda was covered for

91
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,550
over two years so we're not just getting
blackout drunk here we're actually

92
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,130
changing the world

93
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,770
this is this is home wing now another
thing that makes derby really unique is

94
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,500
the active focus on defensive talks you
know where who here is involved in the

95
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,510
defensive side of things so blue teaming
rocking a pen test helping your customer

96
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:45,120
figure out how to clean up like this
most of us in this room and at the end

97
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,410
of the day when it comes down to it
everybody we want every attendee to come

98
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,410
and they leave better prepared than when
they came

99
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,230
it's not much good when somebody comes
and sees this great exploit then they

100
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,970
got to go back to work on Monday and say
I don't know it looks cool I've got no

101
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,760
idea how to fix this so talks that when
they when they just go in and they talk

102
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,210
about two minutes of lip service to the
blue team at the very end

103
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,720
that's not changing the world

104
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,890
so here's the thing defense is hard
people like them they know this so Dan

105
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,930
Kaminsky he worked the fabric of
space-time in 2008 when he broke the NS

106
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,780
but he'll be the first to tell you that
that breaking dns itself that was like

107
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,160
the easy part

108
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,490
you know relatively of course right he
came from this great background of

109
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:43,710
security great background of dns but
when i was talking to him about it he

110
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,840
said you know from the minute I had a
hunch that this was possible

111
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,949
it took me about a weekend of messing
around and playing around

112
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:58,140
I finally got an exploit so we can a
hard work he then spent the next eight

113
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,120
months working with the whole industry
trying to figure out how to securely

114
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,030
disclose this how to work on it

115
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:11,790
from then on he spent the next eight
years active on on education and working

116
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:18,240
with the community so he has spent far
far more time on the defensive aspect to

117
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,680
that groundbreaking research in 2008
than he ever did breaking things in the

118
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,839
first place and so he just killed a
black hat this year so things are

119
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,700
working out okay for him I think so

120
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,880
not to sound cheesy but it's like if
you've been here for a couple of times

121
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,160
like you're the ambassador to this
wonderful world that we call derby those

122
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,300
first timers that they that they raised
their hands like reach out let them feel

123
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,050
welcome

124
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:53,339
bring them part of the family so
speaking of feeling welcome Jeffrey and

125
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,300
I are a long way from home or from a
little startup in Seattle that someone

126
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,800
like you might have heard about so how
many of you have interacted with

127
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,599
microsoft security response center for
some sort of response or anything like

128
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,890
that so for some of you it might have
been a frustrating experience for some

129
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,210
of you maybe not

130
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,400
hi this is a great example actually so
James for Shaw has been a great great

131
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:28,170
collaborator with Microsoft 100 grand
off of a off of an exploit bacillus as

132
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,219
part of the blue hat prize 12 hundred
thousand dollars on a defense of

133
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:39,750
mitigation idea so Microsoft very very
much values the work with researchers

134
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:46,170
that that point about the blue hat prize
if you have ideas on what things can be

135
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,490
done to secure the industry secure
products secure microsoft we're all ears

136
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,910
reach out on Twitter reach out on
whatever microsoft you're not gonna have

137
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,910
a hard time finding us out there

138
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:04,439
Jeffrey and I we work on Windows center
windows server system center as your

139
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:12,089
stack so we don't obviously represent
all of Microsoft but we thought we'd

140
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,990
give you get an insight into the way
that we think about security and not

141
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,200
coincidentally it really represents in
it

142
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:27,570
it mirrors the way that security thought
of about across a lot of Microsoft so

143
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,079
one of the most complicated things when
you start talking about security issues

144
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,560
is the distinction between security
boundaries

145
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,279
you've got security features and then
you've got tradecraft so this year at

146
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,260
Def Con Joshua Drake he goes by jada
gave a cock a great talk on how to

147
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,910
improve your vulnerability research is
also speaking later on today by the way

148
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,620
about stage fright

149
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,050
you might want to check that out I'm so
Jay doc has ample experience with bees

150
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,109
and stuff but one of the things that
really struck me when he was talking

151
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,610
about his early time in the industry was
this friend he had and he would always

152
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,149
come running to imitate hey look I found
a new vulnerability found a new exploit

153
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:14,190
and his friend with sediment side and
paid you know it's not really here the

154
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,450
way to think about it

155
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:19,140
the question is what did you have

156
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,599
and what did you get there

157
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,920
found i like to call it the axiom of
choice and so once you've got a

158
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,390
situation could you have accomplished
the exact same thing in a in a bunch of

159
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,800
different ways

160
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,420
if so it's probably not a security
boundary so a great example of if you

161
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,729
cause a thousand dollars of damage after
break into a house and smashing a TV the

162
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:53,529
TV isn't the vulnerability there you had
a bunch of so some of the stuff that

163
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:56,560
sounds really obvious when you laid out
this way but it can get pretty

164
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,649
complicated when you start talking about
in the real world a B is a great example

165
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:09,010
a B they love to talk about every new
ransomware attack they see that using

166
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,630
powershell and the reason they do this
is because they literally can't keep up

167
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,750
with the plain old stuff that just plain
old actually getting downloaded but they

168
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,589
also do this because we as a community
we we encourage it we blog it

169
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:30,830
retweet about it we talked about it a
minute their power

170
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:36,470
I'll problem they don't seem to add co2
told her to fuck problem order next

171
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,470
before problem i don't get it but they
just don't

172
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,880
so let's talk about the anatomy of one
of these malware attacks that using

173
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,410
powershell really what it would end up
doing almost always you get an end-user

174
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,709
double-click son of a dog or an excel
file

175
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,430
you know I saw one of those things on my
desktop the other day I don't know if

176
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,359
you noted so let's talk to you what do
you think so

177
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,940
double-click on the on the document
those things are really going to enable

178
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,470
macros and run the macro that stuff can
be pretty convincing so this isn't a

179
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,230
slam at all on one users themselves but
from that point you're running DBA so

180
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,790
that's visual basic for applications and
that's the real programming languages as

181
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,560
ugly as you might find it and you know
it's got the full capabilities that can

182
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,750
run win32 API common object it's got a
huge library of stuff that can do

183
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:38,000
I've seen a OSP loader written
completely as a vba macro it loaded the

184
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,640
bites off this is the relocations all
that kind of stuff with just BBA so this

185
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,680
is a real programming language but these
bad guys using powershell for their

186
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,329
macros with the land up doing more often
than not is dawning powershell that XP

187
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:59,840
to run a crappy little script that goes
off to see to download an ACCI and runs

188
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,230
the actually like honestly you didn't
get anything there by using powershell

189
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:09,980
DBA has the ability to go off to me to
download an XC and even when people use

190
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,390
PowerShell you know is pretty famous for
its ability to be kind of coming in its

191
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:20,900
use of the ability to call win32 API but
this malware that uses powershell well

192
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:27,319
it could have called those win32 api is
from DBA directly so what would a doctor

193
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,990
friend tell these AV vendors about all
these powershell exploits starts off

194
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,530
would you have well that arbitrary code
execution you could have written a PE

195
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,480
loader and what did you get after using
powershell you kind of got the more

196
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,290
arbitrary code execution so you didn't
really cross

197
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:50,079
any sort of security boundaries there so
this is kind of like the infosec

198
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,370
equivalent of a tautology just saying
the same thing in different words like

199
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,019
here's a good example plz prepaying
advance i don't know if you can see that

200
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,959
little graffiti in there and they're
like like there's any other way to pay

201
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,339
so you notice there it does point out
this is bad form

202
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:11,649
so take note so they've all put it
really well

203
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,069
power shoulder richer the original point
of attack was never powershell no never

204
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:21,639
said this so you know we got a
traditional security boundary and these

205
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,160
are the things that survived full
frontal assault by an attacker and it's

206
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,710
something you can use for your own
security guarantee you

207
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:35,110
so you've got a dedication on Windows
you've got your your traffic management

208
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,090
via firewall you've got the HT access in
Apache like these are things that are

209
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:45,549
protecting your permit from attackers so
these are fundamental elements and

210
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:51,400
they're going to get passion mediately
but the one thing that missing so often

211
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,740
people talk about security boundaries as
they do it without context when people

212
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,040
say this protects you this is like a
meaningless sentence

213
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:07,809
what does it protect you from right like
contact it's critical your web browser

214
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:13,059
it protects you from visiting a
malicious web page of the the file

215
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:18,309
permissions on your OS they protect you
from an unauthorized non administrator

216
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:23,379
acting that file so Power Cells
execution follow you probably all heard

217
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,080
about it but that's a great example
where the bunch of the industry has

218
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,360
failed to talk about contact there

219
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,629
so think about th modern on unix right

220
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:40,120
chmod on unix prevents you protect you
from accidentally running scripts the

221
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,330
execution policy and power shows exactly
the same thing it protects you from

222
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,520
accidentally running a script it doesn't
protect you from an attacker taking over

223
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,210
your machine with arbitrary code
execution and managing to run powershell

224
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,500
code that's why we explicitly added a
value bypass

225
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,000
so that no one would confuse it with a
security policy and yet still and yet

226
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,560
still right and you know we're thinking
about making a change to say maybe

227
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,490
bypass with too subtle but maybe it's
like dash what part of not a security

228
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,490
boundary do not understand like to help
so we recognize it will feel that goes

229
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,570
open source powershell you guys can
submit a PR just please shut up

230
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,670
so one of the places that can really
start to feel money though is security

231
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,350
feature so a security boundary
represents the thing that's going to get

232
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:34,780
passion stuff but a security feature
represents something that can help you

233
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:40,270
with security but maybe it's not
designed for full frontal attack so it

234
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,889
may be a feature is great at for
blocking certain forms of attack or it's

235
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:50,800
great at increasing the cost of impact
those are great examples maybe i think

236
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:59,200
is the best example of a malign security
feature maybe could be Rick maybe it's

237
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,250
just useless

238
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,240
maybe it's actively evil
destroying-everything-in-sight except

239
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,300
for the thing should i love this video
because it Cece do

240
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,320
Nicolas Cage is trying to destroy the
attackers he misses completely and kills

241
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:18,129
all the buildings and people in them so
like babies like clearly not perfect and

242
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,480
if it's barely even a fight for many
people if an attacker wants to do

243
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,080
something they're going to get past baby
and are generally not gonna have to wait

244
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,370
for long so a be vendors like they're
always trying to make their their

245
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:37,360
product more robust but maybe bypass
isn't going to earn a TV right so that

246
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:44,350
said AV save the hundreds of millions of
computers every year from being

247
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:50,350
compromised that generally it's again
like after a user downloads some malware

248
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,870
run the word doc or something like that
so consider some data familias microsoft

249
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,010
security intelligence report so this has
been around for years the great great

250
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:07,690
source of data so every quarter twenty
percent computers encounter malware and

251
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,060
I don't mean like the kind of Maggie
stuff like oh there's that

252
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,669
tracking cookie I mean like this is a
known thing so actual malware that a bee

253
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:21,670
protect them from so that's over a
hundred million users every year that

254
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:29,440
are not getting compromised that
otherwise absolutely would have so

255
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,430
tradecraft you know that that what
people do when they're talking about

256
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,000
when you've got that axiom of choice
you've got your choice of tool

257
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,490
techniques practices

258
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,410
quality of life all these kind of thing
that's our tradecraft comes and so good

259
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,780
tradecraft gives you talk to the place
like this bad trade cat tradecraft

260
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,420
brings you into like the virus total
hall of fame or something I don't know

261
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,160
what it is but pretty bad so this
distinction between security boundaries

262
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,380
and security features this can start to
be the source of a lot of frustration if

263
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,250
you're reporting an issue in a security
like mechanism but then you're told that

264
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:11,500
it's not a security boundary and it's
easy to think that this whole like not a

265
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,730
security boundary response means it's
like the end of the conversation but

266
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:21,250
it's not if it can be the start of this
set of things that aren't security

267
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,920
boundaries but still have resulted in
collaboration that's been some of the

268
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,910
source of some of the richest stuff we
seem in collaboration with this industry

269
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,200
you can imagine

270
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,519
anything like this causing hard feelings
right component to own down go all the

271
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,830
browsers it's obviously not comfortable
if you ever want to see your baby hurt

272
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:50,649
like that but especially in volume this
kind of research really really help

273
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:56,799
companies and products understand areas
that they can focus on here's a great

274
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,730
example this year from Matt Miller and
David West and they gave a talk at black

275
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:07,120
hat so in 2003 you gotta know day he
found a buffer overflow the overall

276
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,590
return address

277
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:17,110
call it a day good party 2016 you need
to bypass a SLR step control-flow guard

278
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:22,090
sandboxing spray mitigation code
integrity Holocaust the policies like

279
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,980
this list goes on

280
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:30,070
the cost for exploit has gone so much
higher and the last 10 years that is

281
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,649
ridiculous it's now often to the domain
of severe severe expertise and nothing

282
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:40,600
you're going to do on a weekend just
replying the whole point here is that

283
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:47,810
collaboration has been the key so
perhaps

284
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,370
the one-sided the most one-sided example
I can think of is of collaboration I've

285
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:58,639
seen is somebody saw this tweet
forwarded to us so that the person

286
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,440
originally thought that they had found
their way into the surface RT tablet had

287
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,690
fun with that but in fact we realized
that this was an issue in secure boot as

288
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:15,950
a whole and so we finally reached out to
them started working with them and we

289
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:22,790
started patching this underlying thing
as part of ms 16 130 all get so I think

290
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,270
that's like a great example of when
you've got a great collaborative

291
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:32,840
community everybody cares everybody
wants to bring things together this I

292
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,520
didn't know that we were running the
nano server bug bounty at that point and

293
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,720
so this this finding was actually in
scope of that bug bounty and we let him

294
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,480
know with the nine thousand dollar check
so like that that that kind of

295
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,060
engagement that the way that it was
reported wasn't ideal but we are

296
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,220
committed to actively working with
people and having that community work

297
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,050
together has gone 0 come a long way of
making things better

298
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:12,140
right so you you might recognize this
guy's Davies kind of a dreamer

299
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,630
haha

300
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:20,650
yes this is these are unapproved slide
haha so before he had darkened the

301
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:27,280
hallways of of a Louisville with that he
gave a talk at DEFCON talking about

302
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,720
oh my god you know he discovered
powershell which was awesome right

303
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,460
however that talk was in two thousand
and sewed a really smart guy

304
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:44,500
not the quickest the ok so after that
right so now powershell adoption sense

305
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,220
that powershell adoption has just been
exploding right as you really used by

306
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,720
everybody right it's used by IT
professionals it's used by the DevOps

307
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,610
community it's used by coders it's used
by intrusion detection people is used by

308
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,899
forensic you don't just use everywhere
in case you're not up on recent events

309
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:09,220
it's even used by unix admins now that
tripe we've now open source power shell

310
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:16,390
and made it available on Mac OS on linux
so it's available everywhere so Dida you

311
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,300
know if you ever curious about how
powershell does something you can just

312
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,800
go to the github repo and take a look at
the code itself if you don't like that

313
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,450
code change it

314
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,960
issue a poll requests where we are
accepting pull request from the

315
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,240
community and in fact we even have
community committers to certain portions

316
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,970
of PowerShell so you know it really is
an open thing this is a new Microsoft so

317
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,680
encourage you to join that ok so you
know increasingly though we've seen a

318
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,860
number of power shelf post exploitation
frameworks right now let no one say post

319
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:56,199
exploitation framework is very important
to note that nothing resembling a

320
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,030
security foundry was harmed in the
making of this framework okay right so

321
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:05,230
at some point somebody got this phishing
email looked like it came from their

322
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:10,120
bosses private email address it referred
to the project they were working on it

323
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,169
referred to their co-workers and said I
need you to you review this document

324
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,280
immediately any double click on it and
then something that happened it just

325
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,660
seemed to go right so there was some
phishing attack they own that guy and

326
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,770
then once they own it they had some
ability to do some other stuff

327
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:31,809
or a server was hacked with a sequel
injection attack again

328
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:36,039
now all of a sudden you have arbitrary
code execution and you can do anything

329
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:43,179
you want you can run luau you can run
Python you can run c++ but at some point

330
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:48,399
you know you quality of life and quality
work matters so you choose powershell

331
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,918
right because that's just that's just
the where all the goodness is and you

332
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,100
choose powershell and then you decide
well I'm gonna go do some wonderful

333
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,570
stuff right so this is you know post
exploitation tool kick is really the you

334
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:07,178
know the quintessential axiom of choice
very quick example essential example of

335
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:13,059
the axiom of choice right on these bad
guys right they could go from patient

336
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:18,340
zero to domain admin long before
powershell and they could do it without

337
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,110
power shell right so that has nothing to
do with it but once you have arbitrary

338
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,369
code access you can do anything you like
by the way I love this one example here

339
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:32,918
what does it take own shell for
bitch-ass admin that try and block our

340
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:39,909
powershell candy fact that you know you
just gotta love that right so anyway

341
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:44,619
with this proliferation of of toolkits
right the exploitation cool cats right

342
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:51,519
there's this app invoke mimic at powers
Boyd PS attack powershell Empire how

343
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,289
pone shell social engineering tool kit
is just the kind of these things right

344
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:00,490
and so it's something you might say boy
you know that they may be these things

345
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,659
cause some part feeling and i'll have to
admit that when i first saw the things

346
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:08,590
that was really kind of taken aback like
oh my heaven you know what what have I

347
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,789
done I've Unleashed this force of evil
upon the world these post exploitation

348
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:13,899
to get this

349
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:18,998
that's like their packaging and the evil
for everyone to accept right and so you

350
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:23,590
know it took a while I sort of had mixed
feelings about it and you know but again

351
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,809
right

352
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:29,408
we know you have your post exploitation
to exploit

353
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,470
yeah

354
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:41,030
okay so yeah you know any business is
good business right

355
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:50,660
however in is the powershell european
conference this year Matt schroeder was

356
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,890
given a talk about powershell Empire and
and all the sudden you know I had an

357
00:29:54,890 --> 00:30:00,230
insight right it became clear dad this
moment of clarity and that moment of

358
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:05,900
clarity made me a strong advocate of
these toolkits and that moment clarity

359
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:11,150
was I conversation with the audience
around hey Lindsey will stop and what I

360
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:16,280
realized was that there is true security
and then there's hope

361
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:22,460
fueled by ignorance ok there's true
security and there's hope

362
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,800
fueled by ignorance and the thing was
that these post exploitation toolkits

363
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,450
shatter that hope with knowledge

364
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,890
ok and that's a good thing ok it
shattered that up with knowledge now

365
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:44,450
what you're left with is fear confusion
even despair but you have clarity about

366
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,730
where you are and your clarity about the
need to act and that's all good

367
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:55,400
stop ok so you know the routine did not
need a any of these frameworks to go

368
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,140
from as a patient zero to do this they
could do whatever they want and so we're

369
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,670
very friendly to these at post
exploitation toolkits and we're going to

370
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:10,460
encourage them right and if they help
people discover their bad practices like

371
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:15,710
finding out that they have 3000 domain
administrators because they were sloppy

372
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:21,830
with their security group management
then this is all good good good stop now

373
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,370
we got to talk about the note

374
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:29,629
ok a lot of you think the guy's a
traitor allow do you think the guy's a

375
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,310
hero all not going to get into that but
I'm going to tell you that the reality

376
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:39,080
is that he had a substantial effect on
security ecosystem

377
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:45,500
ok so powershell are sorry microsoft had
already been committed to a recommit

378
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,980
minus of two security with our trust
work

379
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,169
the computing version 2 we're already
down that path but after the Snowden

380
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:59,600
revelations it was a a an issue of thing
yep we're in and here's how much I'm

381
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,240
going to invest to get by men

382
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,110
here's how much I'm going to invest
because the reality is well everyone was

383
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,330
committed to security and that's really
true really is the reality is that that

384
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:16,189
when you know security researchers would
come and talk to us and say help you

385
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:21,140
know this is possible that's possible
with the sort of exotic exploit a number

386
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,820
of would say huh well that's true but
perhaps a better solve with another

387
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,799
layer of tin foil for your hat i just
love that cat is that the most awesome

388
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,530
captain role anyway what's known made
clear was that these esoteric attacks

389
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,040
were not only feasible they were in
practice today

390
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,480
ok now I know a number of you will say
hey listen you're bad

391
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,820
stop at known was talking about the
righteous you know a hacking of a

392
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,980
sovereign nation state for the
betterment of our of our our national

393
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:00,110
interests and an ok fine but the reality
is used . about true vulnerabilities and

394
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,649
the fact that exploiting them were
feasible and so maybe they're being

395
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,340
exploited by our National Intelligence
Agency but guess what they're being used

396
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,830
by the other national intelligence
agencies as well and from there it's

397
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,970
just a matter of time before the
criminals are using the same exploit and

398
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,980
from there the script kiddies

399
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:24,380
ok so this was a really big difference
now again the conversation had already

400
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,929
been going on but really these
revelations change the scope the

401
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:35,960
magnitude and the intensity of our
investment securities are certain

402
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:43,190
investment in security windows 10
Windows Server 2016 powershell version 5

403
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:49,130
and lots of other things are
substantially more secure because of the

404
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:54,320
Snowden revelations ok and we're also
taking a much more up of mature approach

405
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,490
to this right and if it really started
before the Snowden revelations but again

406
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,090
we really it really drove home the need
to take a more mature

407
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,649
her approach so in addition to hardening
our systems were paying a lot of

408
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,990
attention to this soon reach mind that
assume the bad guys are in what are we

409
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,098
gonna do it about it

410
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,859
how am I gonna find him how am I going
to disrupt them how am I going to

411
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:23,000
mitigate and repair from the attacks now
with all this top right that security

412
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,790
bug that nation-states post exploitation
toolkits you know you might a you don't

413
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:33,589
think you fall into the pit of despair
in fact that was a couple couple years

414
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:38,599
ago but in reality i think that the
wrong way of viewing it in fact recently

415
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,000
i have a switch from being a security
pass the mess to being a security

416
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,619
optimist

417
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:51,440
ok so let's let's step back a second and
talk about spam how to recognize that

418
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,540
that's actually spam sushi

419
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,609
apparently that's the thing though the
the horror

420
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:03,740
anyway so you're like the early days of
email you know you to open up your inbox

421
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,939
and you just be flooded with all the
spam right offers to make certain body

422
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:16,220
parts smaller and other parts larger and
and just you know infected is in 2004

423
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,160
that bill gates that you know in two
years

424
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,920
stam will be solved remember that 2004
ok two years family saw them till the

425
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,680
smart guy but I don't you recall in 2006
spam was not a solved problem right it

426
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,810
was going pretty strong in fact if it
weren't for an unfortunate mishap in a

427
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,369
wire transfer from Nigeria I be sitting
on a beach in Turks and Caicos instead

428
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:45,349
of talking to you so you know
unfortunate there anyway so pass forward

429
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:50,089
and today you know you know plus your
finger it doesn't really seem like a big

430
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:53,839
issue when I occasionally get a random
piece of mail but it largely seems like

431
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,270
a up a solved problem and so what
happened and where the answers is that

432
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:06,619
there's a large vendors right outlook
gmail yahoo that represent the bulk of

433
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:09,400
the email addresses in the world like
over thirty percent

434
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:14,470
so what that means is that when a
stammer goes and sends out spam thousand

435
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:19,359
pieces of spam over 350 of these are
going to be caught are going to be death

436
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,550
into one of these guys get outlook or
start one of their addresses and what

437
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:30,250
that does is it gives these vendors a
clarity as to the patterns and practices

438
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:35,920
right they get a global perspective
around what's going on and these vendors

439
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,650
have dedicated teams full-time team
dedicated to battling spam

440
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:47,710
ok so what that means is when a spammer
tries a new technique you got teams on

441
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:52,180
this johnny-on-the-spot solving this
address in this attack counter-attack

442
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,370
against this before any of us have the
opportunity to open up our spam attack

443
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:02,980
and configuration file right and so this
is a shift from individuals English fam

444
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,290
to team dedicated specialized teams
dedicated to spam this is roughly

445
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:13,390
equivalent of going from the guy in the
whole lap here lab right the Minuteman

446
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:19,120
full-time farmer part-time warrior right
to the guys on the right here dedicated

447
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,380
Navy SEALs right whales off some lethal
forces the world has ever seen

448
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,390
ok and so that the interesting thing
about this is that a parallel many of

449
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:34,330
the things we're seeing in the infosec
community right so a you know I don't

450
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:40,210
think that spam for security are ever
going to fall into the main of solve

451
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,170
problem but I think we're on the verge
of being able to say that at some point

452
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:49,660
we can now see line of flight to the day
when these bulk untargeted

453
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,350
unsophisticated attacks are in the past

454
00:37:53,350 --> 00:38:00,549
ok so as with fam I i think it all first
starts with specialization right I just

455
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:06,160
imagine the guys and no honey i'm not
going to pay money for a past control

456
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,810
professional

457
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,810
I could do this on my own

458
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:21,940
ok i just love that video ok so now you
can ok so what would be the so it starts

459
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,390
with specialization and specialization
in a couple different ways for people

460
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:30,970
and encode the reality is most of the
systems we use today are cobbled

461
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:34,839
together systems of general-purpose
component right you have a

462
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,600
general-purpose operating system

463
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,900
what do you do you put a bunch of stuff
on there you change a bunch of stuff

464
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,610
maybe the good may be bad

465
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,810
you run that then on what on a
general-purpose networking it can do

466
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,580
anything and you've got this arbitrary
operations model we're sort of anybody

467
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,259
can do anything at any time then
surprised that we have some problems

468
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:02,800
ok and now what brings we would kind of
led me to my my optimism what this shift

469
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,660
towards more crafted solution indeed
microservices the heart of a micro

470
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,850
service is to replace things that we
used to do through dll API call and we

471
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,020
now do through protocols and by doing it
through protopic can do that now because

472
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,220
the great advances and and networking
and because we can do that what that

473
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,470
means i can now take that code and run
it in its own dedicated environment its

474
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:31,240
own dedicated environment so what that
means is and then I know exactly what

475
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,040
should happen in that environment

476
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,550
ok and you'll see we've got a bunch of
things that we're supporting in that but

477
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,090
here's sort of the general concepts
right so that you want to be able to

478
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:44,230
have just enough operating system set up
having everything you have just the

479
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,910
components necessary to run that piece
of code microsoft done that now with

480
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,750
nano server anybody nano server that's
something I've been spent a lot of time

481
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:58,870
on sir just to get the focusrite server
in a desktop that F ad server in the

482
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:03,670
desktop because it makes me sad anyway
server desktop is about at nine and

483
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:11,830
gigabyte PhD server course about a five
gigabyte PhD nano server 480 megabytes

484
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:17,319
coordinating megabyte this thing starts
on the vm about 2.5 seconds it is a you

485
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,600
windows server I'm telling you it's
awesome

486
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,339
anyway so then you just add the
component

487
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:25,479
that you need light you want to have
just enough software so you put just the

488
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:29,799
software necessary to accomplish a cast
and then use technologies like device

489
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:35,019
guard and and windows server containers
that that the only code that's going to

490
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:39,129
run in that you have just enough
networking we use firewalls and network

491
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:44,319
ackles to say hey I know exactly who
that guy should be talking to and what

492
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,880
it should be talking to and she like
everything else down right just in time

493
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,210
and just enough administration again on
that machine

494
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,690
I know what you should be doing and you
should we have a technique now to say

495
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,410
those are the only things you do and
here's the only time that you can do

496
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:04,538
them and then ultimately version
controlling everything right with a

497
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:09,190
DevOps workflow now and the model of
immutable infrastructure you put

498
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,660
everything in version control you deploy
that you can rate rapidly and if

499
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,558
everything goes wrong it goes back and
you can find out who did what why

500
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:24,729
ok so it's this world of specialization
ok now these techniques these techniques

501
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:28,269
have been around for a while various
flavors but they've been around for

502
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:33,999
awhile and the reality is is that very
few people are actually taking advantage

503
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:40,328
of these things to build great software
and great secure software so maybe my

504
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:45,880
optimism is unfounded but here's why
don't think it is and that is the cloud

505
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:52,059
ok the cloud the cloud is all about
microservices ok so there's whether it's

506
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:59,349
amazon s2 or Microsoft Bob you know that
each one of these vendors has a rich set

507
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:05,259
of microservices ok and even their one
of the microservices tends to be a

508
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:09,549
worker role where you don't even use I
as infrastructure-as-a-service where you

509
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:13,329
have a vm and do whatever you want to
with it instead you give us the code you

510
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:18,579
want to run will take that code we
hosted in our environment we keep that

511
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:22,719
environment always patch always up to
date etc and then that little piece of

512
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,739
code then calls each one of the
microservices so fact a modern

513
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:30,309
application environment is taking
advantage of this already

514
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,819
ok but now here's where it gets exciting
right

515
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:41,199
and here's where it gets exciting
exciting is that each one of these micro

516
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:48,190
services hosted by the cloud vendors has
their own team of like Navy feels right

517
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,739
these guys are full-time people who are
dedicated their careers are on the line

518
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:57,940
to make sure that service is available
and secure

519
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:03,729
ok and the car vendors like Microsoft
AWS we have full-time red team

520
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:08,979
constantly drilling against these people
looking for flaws pointing out the squad

521
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:11,229
and they're constantly getting better

522
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:15,939
ok so basically we're shifting from this
world of like global anything can happen

523
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:20,920
I don't know what good is or bad is to
this world where I know exactly what

524
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,400
should be happening right but if you
think about it perhaps the most

525
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:32,289
important advance is not just this but
the global perspective afforded by the

526
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:35,559
cloud operating system right

527
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:40,930
that is to say now we're running lots of
people environment lots of people code

528
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:44,410
and we can see the patterns and
practices of what's going on

529
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:48,430
ok so we have something called Windows
Defender advanced threat protection

530
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:54,430
right and what this does is it is it
takes a look at the system and gives you

531
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:59,319
a dashboard right now this dashboard
looks like any debt for you seem in any

532
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:04,808
number product but there's a real key
distinction when you drill into one of

533
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,829
the panels and you take a look at the
file and you right-click on it but you

534
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:14,890
can get is a mallet report upon the
world wide use of that file

535
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:19,059
okay because we have this global
perspective so if you look at some

536
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:22,930
executable and you find out well we're
just drop this on your on your system

537
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:28,569
that executable and only seems been seen
one time in the entire world you might

538
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:30,999
want to pause before running that right

539
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:37,238
this chances are maybe you're under
under an attack right so a so the point

540
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:41,859
is that we have your professional teams
that look at this global perspective now

541
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:45,519
you could say well you know i'd like to
do that myself but you don't have that

542
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:46,979
global perspective

543
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,250
so all that stuff you you want to
eventually get around to you know that

544
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:58,109
stuff around you know threat Intel
sharing IOC analysis adp a attribution

545
00:44:58,109 --> 00:44:59,279
right all things

546
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,170
guess what they're really really hard
machine with all of the new machine your

547
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,430
client machine learning and I could take
a look at the log on patterns i could

548
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,839
detect abnormality just what really
really hard as anybody actually tried to

549
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,990
stand up their own big data system

550
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:19,410
oh my gosh that thing's hard right
really really hard

551
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,280
so why not take advantage of the big guy
right the big guys to doing this today

552
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,740
and you can take advantage of it

553
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,430
so again one of the reasons why i'm
optimistic now a lot of people look at

554
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,180
this and say well hey i'm not going to
send my sensitive data to the cloud you

555
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,890
know what that bad

556
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:40,170
well you know they think they can better
protect their data themselves there's a

557
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,260
word for this right it's becoming the
dunning-kruger effect

558
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:48,420
basically it's that thing that says you
know it people are confident because

559
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,859
they don't have the confidence to know
that they're not competent anyway so so

560
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:58,380
let's go back and rethink that's right
so one out of ten phishing emails are

561
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,970
successful one out of ten right so bad
guy just needs to send email the 10-year

562
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:08,339
employees and guess what they're in our
evidence shows us once they're in it's

563
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:15,840
about 24 to 48 hours before they get
domain admin and from there there in you

564
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,980
may never detect them if you detect them
it takes on average about 200 days

565
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:25,890
before you detect them so that the kinds
of that oh I can better secure my data

566
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:30,629
than the club bender you know clearly
the facts do not bear out the confidence

567
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:38,010
okay and yeah doesn't care about this so
again where I think that things will

568
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,760
really tight i'm very confident of the
cloud model where I think we're going to

569
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,400
be a great ship is when we start to get
to this anonymized commoditized sharing

570
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,780
model right where you know the cloud
vendors all play again with each other

571
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,640
and hey I see some of them then attack
anonymize that information give that

572
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,710
press signature to the other

573
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:04,680
and they can share that and protect
their customers as well and this is you

574
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,799
know you might have heard of this model
of the you know the attackers advantage

575
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,089
of the tenders dilemma right so the
defendants dilemma basically goes like

576
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:15,960
that the attacker the defender have to
be right all the time

577
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:22,140
the attacker only have to be right one
ok now the point is with this global

578
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:28,020
perspective we have the opportunity to
flip this upside down and flip it upside

579
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:32,369
down so now imagine that an attacker
attack somebody but they're attacking

580
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:36,930
them and their hosted in the cloud and
that cloud vendor detect that attack is

581
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,770
able to take that information and share
it with the rest of the world all of a

582
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:45,570
sudden one attack the entire world put
on notice and now all the sudden you in

583
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:50,250
the past we talked about burning 0 days
now then you can be burning your your

584
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:55,290
your procedures your threat your
technique and everyone's going to know

585
00:47:55,290 --> 00:48:03,480
about it so the group gets better and
can better defend the individuals that

586
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,500
kind of security advantage that kind of
stuff is epic you might be thinking well

587
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,839
crowded cloud stuff but what about me
like what can I personally do you know

588
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:16,349
that we're in this room

589
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:19,349
we're trying to make the world a better
place

590
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:23,700
we're all taking different paths to get
there but the ultimate goal is to make

591
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:30,839
things more secure the other people who
aren't in that in that mind spacer at

592
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:34,320
home trying to figure out how to make
how much ransom a father will pay for

593
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,550
the pictures of his children so whatever
right so let me tell you a story comes

594
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:43,650
from Twitter this little account i
follow and it's kind of a funny irony

595
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:48,599
there like there's a swift programming
language apple introduced in 2014 and so

596
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:56,190
they they somehow marry that with
infosec so the infosec Taylor Swift so

597
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:59,010
in $MONTH 2015 they started getting
really interested in around somewhere

598
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:05,560
then they got emotionally invested they
can

599
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,540
big start to look at the way that
ransomware propagates the way that it

600
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,880
actually take hold out of that research
they started locking things down just

601
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,660
based on common stuff like find the
thing take a thing make a change right

602
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:27,490
started sharing a pretty cool gpo here's
another

603
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,520
pretty cool so in in powershell we've
always associated double-clicking a

604
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,380
powershell grip with notepad because
people make mistake this is a gpo that

605
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:43,830
does the exact same thing for JavaScript
now the side you know we talked about

606
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,430
the community nature of dirty pond and
everything else in this this community

607
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:53,879
think it takes zero to pick a screenshot
post on Twitter solve your own problem

608
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,330
just help somebody else right for
somebody else now got helped by that

609
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:04,350
little bit of you know intelligence so
after a while the magic happens happy

610
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:14,130
days blocks of ransomware and the kind
of things got a funny way of like paving

611
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,390
the way for future wind you be like I
just I make a little change solvable

612
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,170
problem make a little chain solve a
little problem and then all of a sudden

613
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:25,140
you've got the ability for the thing
yeah you made that change it worked out

614
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,589
people making more changes are doing the
right thing you know if you're thinking

615
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,890
that you need to wait for some huge like
way up high

616
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:37,920
po2 make things happen you just start to
start pitching in and you might think

617
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,710
that things were happily ever after and
everything all great thank goodness

618
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:57,060
gpo save the day but an insidious
brewing bad days bad days

619
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:07,950
I was they took a look at that was like
a friday afternoon so it wasn't a fun

620
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:14,939
weekend i'm sure but in the end our
intrepid hero prevailed figured out what

621
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,630
was happening made some more changes and
made themselves up a better organization

622
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,609
for it

623
00:51:20,609 --> 00:51:23,819
so this little thing like what is a
ransomware in taylor swift have to do

624
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:28,140
with like us and making the world a
safer place if it's somebody realizes

625
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:33,240
that they can make small little changes
one by when do the boring infosec stuff

626
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:39,029
and make the world a better place and
the funny thing about the creative and

627
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:45,240
engineering processes that it's slow and
tedious right itself is boring so then

628
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,430
petrol put this really really well

629
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:53,220
he wrote a smash brothers artificial
intelligence and he presented it at Def

630
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:57,810
Con this year so avid smash brothers
fighting game competitive people make

631
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:58,920
money off of it

632
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,820
avid smash brothers guys will say like
you're never going to write an AI for

633
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:08,609
this is too much taxes too complicated
so he went home but 10,000 lines of code

634
00:52:08,609 --> 00:52:16,020
had one so this screenshot here this is
showing his AI playing a really weak

635
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:22,530
character against the level-9 computer
AI take no damage your booting the

636
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:26,700
computer off the screen and then doing
something that no human can do manually

637
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,419
called a multi shine it's like you got
to be frame perfect in all your stuff

638
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,540
you're doing just trolling like look
what I can do

639
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:38,130
so you might think that this endeavor
was accomplished with like just shining

640
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:42,030
brilliance through-and-through like
making a I go home and like do awesome

641
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:46,920
stuff but if you hear Dan talk about his
experience with this like most of

642
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,180
engineering is like really hard problems
you bang your head on for like hours and

643
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,529
days you saw that your group and you're
like what's next

644
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,899
bang your head day in the next one it
sucks and blue so at any point you talk

645
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:05,280
to this guy and like ninety-nine percent
of the time he's like this sucks i don't

646
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,390
know what I'm doing

647
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:11,069
I can't make any changes like things are
broken but that's what it feels like

648
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,290
do the hard engineering work but at the
end of the day you get AI that feeding

649
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:22,009
the world's best player that smash
brothers especially at

650
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:26,630
conference like this always see are the
amazing and results so another great

651
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:31,700
example was Evan boot right so you show
this total MacGyver hand here you see

652
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,899
that he made a Keurig machine like open
the box took it apart with some rumbles

653
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:41,540
and stuff like that's crazy a jerk
machine out of a of a hand out of a

654
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:48,410
Keurig machine just for fun and what you
don't see is the 200 hours he sped spent

655
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:52,970
his workbench doing all this stuff you
don't see the eight times he cleaned up

656
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:58,939
like you want to clean up to eight times
so Taylor Swift ransomware is a great

657
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:04,070
example of like being empowered getting
stuff done making one change at a time

658
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:08,330
if it seemed that you have the
opportunity to make a change in just

659
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:12,920
running with it like these are the kind
of change challenges that they faced

660
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,810
with every single day and you don't make
their the real difference and security

661
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:22,460
is us it's it's spending our time
tackling these problems one at a time

662
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:31,700
right so you know if your people manager
right you are leadership role you've got

663
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,649
a really great opportunity to encourage
this mindset I discourages mindset of

664
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:41,750
individuals taking time to explore
sharpen their skills make things better

665
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,680
right

666
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,620
and so the question is are you doing
that right are you creating that

667
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,950
environment are you creating that
culture turns out of the manager you

668
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:54,049
really only have two degrees of control
right one is budget and the second is

669
00:54:54,050 --> 00:55:00,080
culture right so let's talk about budget
right are you creating video i'm a big

670
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,210
fan of spending your budget on people
and training first in the area of

671
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:10,880
security people in training first /
projects / products right lot of people

672
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,440
think that they can just throw money at
a product and boom the security Saul and

673
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,660
that's rarely ever the case right so can
you ship some of your budget from

674
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:27,589
products to say contractors to free your
people up to give them time and space to

675
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:33,400
explore to experiment to get get trained
up right if you think about the main

676
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,600
easing dripping and remote management
capabilities that common operating

677
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:43,029
systems are delivering the people that
give you incredible leverage if your

678
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:48,310
people know how to use that right so you
want invest in your people right so we

679
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:54,520
did a great thing research into a search
engine and search powershell and used to

680
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,410
take me right the phrase used to take me
they found these amazing set of examples

681
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:04,029
right so some guy had written this
automated performance monitoring system

682
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:08,740
that runs every night automatically with
something that used to take hours right

683
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:13,209
or there was this invoice automation
that just happened you took a couple

684
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:18,970
minutes when an infected the past is all
manual and took many hours right and

685
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:23,919
Leeteuk tells us great story but haven't
talked to this small business that had

686
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,820
been affected by malware infected by
malware and the CIO small company decide

687
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,780
what I'm going to figure out the scope
of my problem and so he brings a

688
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:40,390
powershell and wrote a powershell
one-liner using Active Directory and the

689
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:45,220
remote scripting capabilities of
PowerShell and in a few short minutes he

690
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:49,149
knew all the systems that had been
affected by the indicated but you have

691
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:54,250
the X show the indicators compromise and
then they could begin remediation right

692
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,850
this is something that what you know if
you had an external engagement you know

693
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:02,680
would cost tens of thousands of dollars
and have a pretty long lead time and yet

694
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,120
this person was able to just go to the
desktop and do it why because they had

695
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,540
taken the time to invest in their
skillset and their knowledge

696
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:21,610
okay so we're gonna do is 12 black oh so
mastering so as you think about this as

697
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:26,560
individuals right that can seem daunting
like Whitney like it falls to me the

698
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,910
answers yet falls to you right and you
know a lot of us could look at this and

699
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:34,720
then be overwhelmed right ways like I've
got to learn all this stuff I've got to

700
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,310
be the protector and you can begin to
have this this you know imposters

701
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:44,380
syndrome right and Alicia loose said
this really well right

702
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,109
she said hey the reality is that

703
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:50,319
this world where you is perspective
where do you think

704
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:55,239
here's what I know and here's what the
other people now when in fact it's not

705
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:59,559
that at all in fact is that you have
this domain of expertise and other

706
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:03,910
people have their domain of expertise
and you continue to you just want to

707
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:05,170
like chip away at it

708
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:10,749
learn to be better look you know here's
the reality reality is Microsoft has

709
00:58:10,749 --> 00:58:17,049
over a hundred thousand employees a
hundred thousand employees of those

710
00:58:17,049 --> 00:58:21,999
there were only aid technical fellows
working on individual product only ate

711
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:28,029
last year I became one of oh right i
suffer imposter syndrome all the time

712
00:58:28,029 --> 00:58:31,630
right wake up every day thinking at all
man at some point it's going to say that

713
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:34,569
guy doesn't know what the heck he's
doing and I'm going to be fired right

714
00:58:34,569 --> 00:58:39,609
this is a very real thing and so I
encourage you to just say you'll go with

715
00:58:39,609 --> 00:58:44,499
the flow just accepted and just invest
in yourself right so if there's

716
00:58:44,499 --> 00:58:47,589
something that you've been thinking
about doing right so at some point has

717
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:51,160
the psyche of PowerShell and got home I
don't know is that the right thing is

718
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,339
that the one thing if you have one of
those i encourage you to go with it

719
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:55,029
right

720
00:58:55,029 --> 00:58:59,380
follow your passion you don't give
yourself permission to succeed sometimes

721
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,480
it can be a long hard row

722
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,380
example he gave the guy working on the
dozens of time for finally being

723
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:10,420
successful with powershell very
difficult road right in fact pursuing

724
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,710
ended up having to take a demotion of
the monitor that's right demoted took me

725
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,900
five years to get my strength back

726
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:21,489
but then a long run from foam now I'm
technical fellow right so i encourage

727
00:59:21,489 --> 00:59:26,079
you you know in a way it was very
difficult five years but what kept me

728
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,119
going with my passion because I knew
that this was a fantastic model

729
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:36,039
fantastic idea and I just went with it
went with it and ultimately were crude

730
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:40,930
so give yourself the permission to
succeed invest in yourself and I think

731
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,940
you're going to have a whole lot more
fun

732
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:46,869
you guys rock this has been a great der
beek on and enjoy
