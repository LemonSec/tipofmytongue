1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,470
morning everyone thanks for coming when

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,840
I first found out that we were at you

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,190
know 9 a.m. on a Sunday I was like ah

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,410
there's gonna be a total of three people

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,629
counting Rick and I and the cameraman

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,810
and everything so appreciate you waking

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,810
up and coming out to hear or we get

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,900
started into the presentation

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm just leave line them he doesn't like

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,310
the Twitter and when I was making the

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,279
cover page and everything you know I'm

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,899
just like and so annoying that like it

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,660
you know handle him in everything and he

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,579
doesn't have one so I decided to create

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,230
him one and unfortunately if you were

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,890
following on Twitter I decided to keep

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,989
it a secret

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:51,420
somebody blew that the other day and

19
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:52,709
everything yeah but it they did not yeah

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,780
somebody was trying to reach out him

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,789
like Rick you never respond to me he's

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,350
like he talked about he's like I reach

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,199
out to you on Twitter and you're not

24
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,099
responding and he's like well I'm not on

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,539
where he's like yeah you are so but

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,280
we'll go through it a little bit ah and

27
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,229
go over that story a little bit so of

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,640
course you know how to create its where

29
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,470
town and with help with some of the

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,479
people I trust a second's of our friends

31
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,580
you know decided start showing it up I

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,259
gave you know some people to follow you

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,070
know just to make sure you don't had the

34
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,780
good timeline and everything and of

35
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,508
course you know doing some tweets and

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:36,570
then people just loved people that just

37
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,159
really contribute all this stuff and

38
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,829
then you know Dave and Martin were

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,530
totally on board they gave the the spot

40
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,869
of approval for this and it was actually

41
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,549
funny at this morning I woke up you know

42
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,250
got my phone looking over like some of

43
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,049
the emails and of course I see this from

44
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,110
the Ricky oak McHale and I created

45
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,299
you've got 121 recent notifications from

46
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:03,060
Twitter I think it's more popular than

47
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:06,689
my Twitter DML is a solution to some

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:12,330
problems that don't exist don't do that

49
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:12,720
it's not so we come back how do we want

50
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,020
to solve this

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,670
problem does machine learning actually

52
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,650
more disclosure neither of us are data

53
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,200
scientists right and in sort of the

54
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,140
point of this is can you do machine

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:30,000
learning stuff without a d-pad of data

56
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,089
science there's there's a bunch of free

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,130
resources

58
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,790
[Music]

59
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,859
so as we thought about the problem

60
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,660
rattled through again there's a lot of

61
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,640
questions you should actually ask to see

62
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,260
if the problem that you have you might

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:52,359
want to use machine learning to home

64
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:54,970
solve but it distills can't you clearly

65
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,000
state your problem if your problem is we

66
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,650
don't have machine learning that's not a

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,690
problem to solve by getting machine

68
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:08,790
learning that's that's not a business

69
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:08,790
issue that you're trying to face right

70
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,980
his machine learning hood at these types

71
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,140
of problems so machine learning is in

72
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,820
the background there are some algorithms

73
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,130
that are very good at doing certain

74
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,420
types of things there are other certain

75
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,090
types of things that they're not

76
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,790
particularly good at yet or the jury's

77
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,070
out as to whether or not the end at the

78
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,690
end of the day the problems the machine

79
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,900
learning to be really good solving our

80
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,359
pattern recognition problems so if you

81
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,480
can fit your business issue into a

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,270
pattern recognition context it's

83
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,489
probably an occasion where you can at

84
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,140
least start thinking about and then do

85
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,340
you have the right data so the thing

86
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,970
with machine learning is you got to

87
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:56,590
throw a ton of data hit the problem to

88
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:59,200
actually train a machine to do the

89
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,230
thinking for everyone this room is an

90
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,339
expert in security stop or maybe some

91
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,290
people are learning about security stuff

92
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,910
but experts in various domains and

93
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,799
there's that sort of old jurist it takes

94
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,530
about 10,000 hours to get really really

95
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,150
good at something it's not that much

96
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,130
different from an enema and that

97
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,510
perspective right think what 10,000

98
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,219
hours needs in terms of human

99
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,459
understanding all the data points they

100
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,290
get correlated no computers need a lot

101
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,460
of data to be able to think on your

102
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,440
behalf and they're still not going to be

103
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,849
perfect

104
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,850
they're going to give you short brains

105
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:41,349
so our kind of theory on this and the

106
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,360
dollars you never approach it is we have

107
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:47,460
two disparate things to keep in mind all

108
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,460
that we're doing here we I wouldn't say

109
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,400
our fear on this is like that we want to

110
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,260
first do a proof of concept they

111
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,049
actually understand this and our proof

112
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,110
of concept consists in taking one to

113
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,330
spirit framework after we actually train

114
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,810
like that and up that it would actually

115
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:15,940
map one way to another framework that

116
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:20,620
was kind of our first group you know we

117
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:28,570
can actually you know first thing is

118
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:33,090
like we want to take one standard some

119
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,090
of it or multiple controls and actually

120
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:46,509
let's start by trading the system to

121
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,159
like annotate the statements themselves

122
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:52,060
right if we can pull out these words

123
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:55,750
right this is an act this is the target

124
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,810
here's some scoping related words here's

125
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,340
a time frame we figure out what those

126
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,740
keywords are pull those out of

127
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,719
statements now we can start to compare

128
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,300
with all the middle filler words or

129
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:14,949
without some of the suffixes or prefixes

130
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:16,930
or words or the intricacies of like we

131
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,310
can let's compare

132
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,330
let's figure out a way to do to

133
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:24,759
comparison and kind of rank how much of

134
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,440
a match do we think this statement will

135
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,659
these four keywords matches this state

136
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,740
well these different for these five or

137
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:34,150
these twelve is how much does that match

138
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,949
and three is actually okay great now

139
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,599
that we have this list of requirement a

140
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:40,090
requirement via two to six percent match

141
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,509
how do you use we're gonna use it to

142
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,310
focus compliance active right if I'm

143
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:57,759
Mike executive team implement a new

144
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:59,380
framework there's these pages the

145
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,050
contract you don't got to worry about

146
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,580
you're very confident you're doing these

147
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:08,860
thirty things at least from a security

148
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,300
practitioners but uh these three at the

149
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,219
end though you really got to think about

150
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,969
become no match for these kind of

151
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:17,319
security concepts in your really I don't

152
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:20,380
know then the ones in the middle that's

153
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,930
where that middling you know confidence

154
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,400
threshold well think through them see if

155
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,169
you match maybe you only match part of

156
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,960
the so you need to expand the process or

157
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:31,120
even just to really help quickly focus

158
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,909
where you drive

159
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:42,150
based on the documents that continued

160
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:42,150
upon contracts and something like this

161
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:52,710
so we decided to work with Google use

162
00:07:49,259 --> 00:08:00,300
its natural language functionality and

163
00:07:52,710 --> 00:08:05,188
just start my energy just pick out so we

164
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,779
have actions scoping words and this is

165
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:09,199
really kind of what it looks like when

166
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:15,240
you either manually annotate the control

167
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:17,310
using the entity extraction function or

168
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,879
if it annotates it for you based on

169
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:24,300
training it spits something out you get

170
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,550
a whole page you know individual control

171
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,050
requirements that have you know actions

172
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,470
highlighted yellow or whatever

173
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,470
[Music]

174
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,490
and you know get a really high level

175
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:42,789
this is how we're going to do so we

176
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,890
annotated intentionally picked kind of

177
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:51,849
small and similarly worded frameworks

178
00:08:44,890 --> 00:09:00,120
goes imitating time-consuming so we pick

179
00:08:51,850 --> 00:09:00,120
C is top 20 they're all a hundred ish

180
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:12,099
training this is what a target in action

181
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:16,300
then we through pci-dss Adam what's

182
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,480
going to come out don't some stuff to

183
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,479
say

184
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,629
[Music]

185
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:32,700
that like all this stuff but what we're

186
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:34,319
pulling out with that was you know it

187
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,410
was really just to get the extraction

188
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,560
out of the actual comparison we had to

189
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:49,689
[Music]

190
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:52,069
actually take that and then see what

191
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:59,399
[Music]

192
00:09:52,069 --> 00:10:01,378
so kind of from flow perspective not

193
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,839
data scientists we haven't done tons and

194
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:06,360
tons MLS on the path so there's a ton of

195
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,279
good free resources out there so that's

196
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,480
what we did first and then select the

197
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,850
frameworks that we're gonna work with

198
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,639
this is kind of the part of sort of our

199
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,410
recurring operational tasks as we're

200
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:21,680
applying this pick a new framework pick

201
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,680
a new framework and every time we do we

202
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:38,519
get to a place where in our case Lachlan

203
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:41,490
has consistently pulling out those

204
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,089
keywords for us I'm when that data

205
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:49,019
drained the data extracted built the

206
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:51,220
calculator was then compare the data

207
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:56,749
into operation

208
00:10:51,220 --> 00:11:01,110
[Music]

209
00:10:56,749 --> 00:11:02,160
there was a challenge so when Justin

210
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,639
personally thought to be about this

211
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,059
stuff

212
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,279
he had already run through all the room

213
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:10,829
a lot of the free machine learning stuff

214
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,910
that Google had to offer and everything

215
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:13,888
sounded like a really great idea

216
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,209
talking to him about it without having

217
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:18,240
run through a lot of those free

218
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:20,878
resources was extremely challenging

219
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,959
there's an entire lexicon of machine

220
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:32,999
learning stuff it's not one of those

221
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:35,579
things right yeah I know I know about it

222
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:38,069
doesn't really work really really if you

223
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,109
want to start doing stuff use the free

224
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:43,469
resources that are out there run a

225
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,510
couple of the free examples basis and

226
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,210
you'll get a much much better understand

227
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,020
diamond

228
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,020
your own security

229
00:11:51,120 --> 00:12:01,650
yeah help annotate it you know

230
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,870
everything that basically pull a whole

231
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:06,420
bunch of keywords and say anytime this

232
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,460
word shows up in this be annotated this

233
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,860
way so it kind of helped like prep a lot

234
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,420
of our data with that and it was a

235
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,070
Python script it was in their

236
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,800
documentation on Google and everything

237
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,290
so I download it try to run it didn't

238
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,120
work you know if everything so it's one

239
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,219
of those things like you know we have to

240
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,990
dive into code figure out where you know

241
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,450
from that perspective and you know

242
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:34,380
what's working so we had to just even

243
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:37,230
get yeah the other thing about that

244
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,770
script the dictionary annotation style

245
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:43,230
that's worth knowing is so English is a

246
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:47,069
very interesting language and then one

247
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,420
word can mean a lot of different so you

248
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,920
might have one control that says

249
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,620
inventory your assets

250
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,099
okay so inventories my action assets are

251
00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:00,060
my target or you should write

252
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,500
right

253
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,030
[Music]

254
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,100
right yeah the one I like to think about

255
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,060
inventory your assets versus update your

256
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,630
independence

257
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,660
okay so still inventory work it needs to

258
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,939
be extracted but in one it's the

259
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,079
activates the action performed the other

260
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,020
it's the target that you're performing

261
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,940
an action on so the script in Google

262
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,470
documentation it's great it does what it

263
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,330
says it should do as advertised it'll

264
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,790
pull out the word and you have to tell

265
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,160
it whether it's it can only be one thing

266
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,610
and you have to tell it oh is this an

267
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,829
action or is it a target so we had to

268
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,020
sort of do our own thing so that we

269
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,030
could actually because in the cloud you

270
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:44,170
can manually annotate the same word as

271
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:46,209
different keyword types but the script

272
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:51,160
to upload just doesn't work that way so

273
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:56,680
you're looking to do this another big

274
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:59,199
thing that we had to work through so

275
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,949
smart we were talking about this

276
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,430
something oh yeah

277
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,200
controls it controls right it's gonna be

278
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:09,790
these five these are the exact things

279
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:15,040
we're gonna need to actually and I start

280
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:21,000
trying to get into the not even straight

281
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:22,930
so in the back matter is the first and

282
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,870
there's gonna be something that has to

283
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:29,050
be done it has to be done it seems

284
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:31,060
pretty reasonable none of the controls

285
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,199
work raise them right and frankly in

286
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,760
terms of the frameworks that we went

287
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,130
through most of them don't care because

288
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,250
it's inventory your assets there's no

289
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:41,800
factor there okay does the jewelry just

290
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:44,400
needs to be done right a lot of

291
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,709
frameworks also don't have frequencies

292
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:50,730
clearly define out of control by control

293
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,920
right they might say

294
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:55,830
assess your compliance with the

295
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,709
framework annually but whether you do a

296
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:01,950
you know constantly updating inventory

297
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:04,200
refresh your inventory refreshing nearly

298
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:08,340
you know certainly there are pros and

299
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,800
cons a TRO generally doesn't so

300
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,860
frequency wasn't in most of the things

301
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:18,540
either and then in terms of the action

302
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:27,090
itself you know we we had to update your

303
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:30,209
inventory that's actually so the point

304
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:31,560
your being the framework that you use is

305
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,720
going to be critical it's going to drive

306
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,410
the rest of this process right the key

307
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,120
words that you decide to pull out and if

308
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,650
you go into it thinking yeah

309
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,360
conceptually I understand how this is

310
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:46,770
going to work right when you dive into

311
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,150
the data that's going to when you

312
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,520
actually get into the data to solve the

313
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:53,939
problem that you're doing you're gonna

314
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,530
find about different keywords and that's

315
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,540
mine you just need to know that it's

316
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:02,660
coming so that you're updating your

317
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:05,099
frame don't don't waste a lot of time

318
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,770
working through the maze of how should

319
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,860
be annotate this just get into it and

320
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,860
start start animating updated

321
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,600
when you feel good

322
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,960
you can annotate most your stuff

323
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,960
accurately

324
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,840
we talked about this a little bit

325
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:26,290
already you know it takes a fair amount

326
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:29,440
of time and effort to actually get

327
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:34,540
frameworks themselves into a format

328
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,280
where you can compare apples so the next

329
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,959
thing is once it's done you don't have

330
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,020
to do it again for that for anyone okay

331
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:45,340
it's just in them

332
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:47,380
Wow but the nice thing is updates that

333
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:52,390
occur the frameworks tend not to be full

334
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:54,910
sale changes of the of the structure of

335
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:58,360
the framework itself right 853 still

336
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,520
going to be your the start of here's ten

337
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,470
different endings of the sentence and

338
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,240
they'll change the content and you gotta

339
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,770
update that but it won't be made your

340
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,750
structural change so once that formats

341
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,050
done it's more tweaks than the major

342
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,520
issues but it takes a while and it's

343
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,540
again it's one of the most important

344
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,129
things is if you're out cleanse the data

345
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,129
I mean it's gonna be very much

346
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,780
the other thing it takes a lot of time

347
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:29,290
three small frameworks that we ended up

348
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,330
being like 400 individual control

349
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:42,240
statements annotating and get telepath

350
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:42,240
many of them I think we had about if

351
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:52,720
it's we're gonna take you to make the

352
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,220
things smarter but you need to have you

353
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,260
need to keep in mind that this is gonna

354
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:00,790
take a lot again it's not just we're

355
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,680
gonna pro computer the problem it's

356
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:09,310
gonna do training it is the hardest part

357
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:20,530
but ideally you just reuse that

358
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:22,540
knowledge so it have to be done on a

359
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,670
monthly basis annual all that stuff and

360
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:29,680
everything one of the things we quickly

361
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:31,960
found out we didn't have enough data

362
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,280
points of you start training you know

363
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,530
type of things so we actually had to

364
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,899
hold that back you know for our new

365
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,160
stoker concept even though like that's a

366
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:43,420
little bit critical thing to measure

367
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:45,960
like I made no pen test we just didn't

368
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,840
have enough data points

369
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,940
[Music]

370
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,470
yeah Google cloud platform specifically

371
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,450
and different tools we're gonna do this

372
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:58,049
differently when they require for you to

373
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:00,470
actually do they require at least a

374
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:03,149
hundred data points of each link attic

375
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,950
if I didn't have 100 things that

376
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:06,539
actually had a frequency attached to

377
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,159
them and I think what we ran through all

378
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:12,389
three of these things we had like 10

379
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,009
frequencies right it just won't be

380
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:16,019
proven if we won't when you train in

381
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:17,970
that day we don't have enough context to

382
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:24,960
actually figure out what a frequency

383
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:27,179
looks like so we had to actually we had

384
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,009
to pull them out and we have to data and

385
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,100
eventually when we get to a hundred the

386
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:34,090
frequency will be part of the model but

387
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,179
yeah it's a great point just

388
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,179
[Music]

389
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:52,169
so hope this was also a real so when you

390
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:53,519
throw the data into the machines with

391
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:56,140
that month it says train it's gonna

392
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:59,640
crunch it all and for all

393
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,590
[Music]

394
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,760
three or four-hour yeah three or four

395
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:08,610
hours for 400 control students which is

396
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,730
not actually a ton when you actually get

397
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,399
into it right that's a long time and we

398
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,770
were only extracting three keywords

399
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,049
right it's 1508 there are data sets that

400
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,879
are much much larger as we iterate it

401
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:22,740
through this in this probably doesn't

402
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,090
scale I would expect it does up to like

403
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,400
a thousand thousand five hundred

404
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:30,990
controls you can expect it to take about

405
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:41,910
an hour for every I'm sure that adjusts

406
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:43,919
over time once we get by extracting so

407
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,890
there is a day where we're trying to

408
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,650
throw data into the system says eternal

409
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,270
air if you're familiar with Google cloud

410
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:55,080
platform internal error generally means

411
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:56,220
our server did something when we know

412
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,418
what it is we're not going to show you

413
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,350
what it is for a couple different

414
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:03,710
reasons try it again in a little bit and

415
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:10,469
just like you know with exponential

416
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:12,270
exponential right so the problem with

417
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,710
that when you're working with all this

418
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,450
data that's weird you're trying to

419
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,530
cleansed it and sometimes there's you

420
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:20,700
know from a character perspective

421
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:23,220
doesn't want to deal with a non-standard

422
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,730
character you don't necessarily know if

423
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,620
this issue is actual is it something

424
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,640
because there's character conversion air

425
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:39,978
is it something else

426
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:39,979
[Music]

427
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,070
[Music]

428
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:55,789
the slanty tick marks that aren't okay

429
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:59,120
yeah yeah they're the backticks and

430
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:00,919
there's also I forget to control there's

431
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,229
a there's a hidden character the end of

432
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:06,799
one of the statements as well that was

433
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,419
super fun to troubleshoot but again

434
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,039
through all that stuff and we get it

435
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:15,169
uploaded once and then like the next day

436
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:16,580
it's like anyway the point is sometimes

437
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:19,909
stuff is just going to happen on

438
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,830
Google's back end be prepared for that

439
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:23,659
potentially in delay usually it only

440
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:34,699
happened a couple times as we're really

441
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:36,980
working through this for hours before

442
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,720
you know if you have a problem right you

443
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,789
can lose a lot of time really quickly

444
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,990
trying to upload the last framework or

445
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:45,200
work to see if it's something that you

446
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:48,850
change I get me prepared didn't happen a

447
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,850
time but it does happen it might not

448
00:22:49,950 --> 00:23:07,019
a percentage of matching to the other

449
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:19,740
controls huh you know doesn't match how

450
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:23,429
closely and I didn't actually what it

451
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:26,549
should matter so here's the example you

452
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:28,620
know the script and everything I don't

453
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:31,019
your anger on Sunday PHP script that I

454
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,120
wrote and everything but you know on our

455
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:35,570
first example that we did so we want to

456
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,000
kind of keep it somewhere on the IDE on

457
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:40,889
and looking at our controls and

458
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,720
everything here's some other signs that

459
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:44,610
we're getting back and keep in mind the

460
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,460
way the logic of the script works is I'm

461
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:49,620
taking on the source framework there

462
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,580
I'm taking that iterating over every

463
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:55,860
single control which would be the easy

464
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:00,960
Ivers and I'm looking at every single

465
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:04,019
one so basically every single these guys

466
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:07,649
the ID am one and then we're getting up

467
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:10,139
percentage match so if we look at you

468
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:12,989
know three we came down from saying

469
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:16,260
guess these are absolutely matching you

470
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:18,990
know they're in the top six you know

471
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,360
they're tempting and that's great you

472
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,070
know so we're getting like a concept

473
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,779
that it's getting there you know those

474
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,760
are magic poles

475
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:29,399
based on the context of the annotations

476
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,559
are coming back we're doing this now if

477
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:33,989
you notice there's a few ones in between

478
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:36,059
there that it's coming out you know so

479
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,529
if we take you know one three six and

480
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,799
actually validate you know some of this

481
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:43,350
stuff look at this control reading this

482
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,750
yeah none match I don't get out too big

483
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,939
so we still have some work to do but I

484
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,799
want to show kind of progressed with

485
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,500
that like the one control you know Sarah

486
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,500
11.1 oh one is hot match out of all the

487
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,030
controls that we ran

488
00:24:53,500 --> 00:25:02,880
[Music]

489
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,879
so it's close but now we have to go back

490
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,530
so it's a process

491
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:16,630
[Music]

492
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,449
hey the future you know what we're going

493
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:22,769
to be looking at

494
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:25,049
yeah so obviously the the first thing we

495
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:27,029
want to do is is history right it's it's

496
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,499
in some ways very much like a separate

497
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:30,840
we caught the three things we wanted to

498
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:32,940
catch but we also caught some other

499
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,279
balls pause so now we need to tweak

500
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,320
right the calculate compares the

501
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,269
calculation to make sure that we're

502
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:48,450
filtering out the bad stuff based on

503
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:49,679
some other years so we found it was very

504
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,739
interesting as we started looking the

505
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,820
data why we've got some false positives

506
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:58,649
there's some controls that were Auto

507
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:05,600
annotated maybe just one word so it just

508
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:08,748
has an action for some reason or maybe

509
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,129
there's a missing annotation somewhere

510
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:14,669
there's actually not enough information

511
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:18,748
to make leak impaired a statement that

512
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:20,009
just has the word with anything else so

513
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:21,809
we need it we need to we need to pare

514
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:24,059
that down you say look there's a minimum

515
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:28,369
amount of data that you need annotated

516
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:31,999
each one of these patrols to actually a

517
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:31,999
minimum amount of words

518
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:41,070
the other thing that we're gonna start

519
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:42,720
probably once we get is also using maybe

520
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,928
a second round of machine learning to

521
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,669
see if we can do the calculations

522
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:49,440
alright so the comparison right again

523
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:50,159
she learning is really good at pattern

524
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,049
recognition

525
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,090
so theoretically again if I can

526
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:55,619
construct my problem such that all right

527
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,678
now I know what these keywords are

528
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:00,509
getting poured out I can say well here's

529
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,299
a pattern of key words these key words

530
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:05,639
exist in this state of text and I think

531
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:06,869
that's the inventory and I throw another

532
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:09,299
thing at it from a machine learning

533
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:12,199
perspective it says hey it's similar

534
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:14,399
keywords is this an inventory controller

535
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,710
so right now we're using a manual

536
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:21,029
comparison calculator and we probably do

537
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,529
that for a while but theoretically you

538
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:25,019
could probably run through an iteration

539
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:26,700
of ml to extract the key words

540
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,580
themselves and another iteration and

541
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,789
that was you actually do the matching

542
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,789
based on

543
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:44,280
the other topping some hard to get that

544
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,740
better training and getting remember

545
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,000
accurate as he saw in our examples we

546
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,820
really haven't touched anything with

547
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,020
pipes en you know which has its own

548
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:57,330
different verbage and you know you know

549
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:04,379
annotation stuff of that but point in

550
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:07,020
some more so we get the other thing

551
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,360
we're gonna do we didn't have anything

552
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,000
[Music]

553
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,169
actually valid basically us running

554
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,930
tests against it that was doing

555
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:18,420
validation what do some stuff where you

556
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:24,900
can actually put a training testing

557
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:27,300
model next and actually get the median

558
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:31,590
respect to say this is what was right

559
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:34,169
when I trained my model before we even

560
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:36,760
get to the grass like is this right what

561
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:39,950
it actually spit out you know

562
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:44,990
the way popular justices you you can say

563
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:46,549
I want this this data to be testing I

564
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,710
want this day to be training data like

565
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:51,649
you can build different data domains if

566
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,600
you don't do that at all it will when

567
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:57,229
you do an update or when you do a train

568
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,449
it'll peel out a percentage of in our

569
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:05,179
case internal statements some automatic

570
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:07,190
tests in the accuracy so we do have some

571
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:09,289
of that but we didn't choose what data

572
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,970
was actually test data versus what data

573
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:21,350
was trained in it was just the random

574
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:26,480
sample who actually now so we have the

575
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:28,309
challenge is again if it's his part of

576
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,110
its random sampling it just happens to

577
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:33,340
all three controls that have very few

578
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:35,510
annotations right it's an actual

579
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,480
percentage confidences in terms of

580
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:41,389
recall the accuracy are going to be off

581
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,010
because it's validation data is not

582
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:45,309
going to match it's not going to it's

583
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:48,730
not going to fit the general

584
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:48,730
confirmation pattern

585
00:29:49,070 --> 00:30:04,409
so so there is some automated stuff yeah

586
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:06,429
so contract perspective throw some some

587
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:11,149
very

588
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:13,309
loosely structured because your

589
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:27,199
organization probably isn't adopting a

590
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:28,700
new framework every single day so we

591
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,220
want to start to tune this so it's not

592
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,379
just doing frameworks from a training

593
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,090
perspective but it's also a liquid we're

594
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:36,949
using some contracts to help train it

595
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,780
and stuff mountains I think that's where

596
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:47,109
a lot of the operational

597
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:47,109
[Music]

598
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,540
yeah the appendices whatever that may be

599
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,939
so talking about like hey you must do

600
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,590
these 50 things if you're gonna be you

601
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,840
know our customer and everything so

602
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,209
digesting those compared again some days

603
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,129
of what your company does you know

604
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:07,500
looking at where those disparate

605
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:10,250
differences are we need to go back to

606
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,250
the negotiating table

607
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:19,960
Vlessing that one of the things that we

608
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:21,999
found was a problem was getting

609
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,799
normalize data from the control

610
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:26,019
frameworks and everything and this a

611
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,729
little like side project I've had for a

612
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:31,359
little while but it's been on the

613
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:33,869
backburner we've done a lot of work in

614
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:37,029
it route like getting all the controls

615
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:41,019
nice fashion and we're gonna be putting

616
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:43,869
it out on github come on just normalize

617
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:46,509
like if you want PCI data that's easily

618
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:48,849
hard over you know like a JSON or ya

619
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:49,149
know format we have white decide with

620
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,859
that

621
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:52,928
what'll be easily digestible you can

622
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:54,939
take it you know whole part like here's

623
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:56,710
the reference there's a control here's

624
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,210
the text to that with some you know

625
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,889
different fields and all that stuff so

626
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,659
we're gonna be throwing out on github

627
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:10,139
like the next week or two or so like

628
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:10,139
that that's it yes

629
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:17,440
yeah

630
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:21,690
[Music]

631
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,370
yes as they came out with it

632
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:27,120
[Music]

633
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:29,699
yep because on the annotations they came

634
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,040
out with the exact same words and

635
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,140
everything is what came out so yeah we

636
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:38,310
dove into that quickly to see exactly

637
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:40,230
what that was again the set that they

638
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:42,300
pulled out with that it just came out

639
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:45,520
with like the same three works you know

640
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,520
[Music]

641
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:59,530
small statements but the long control

642
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:02,560
had a lot of words so one of the things

643
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:05,050
that we found is the contextual words in

644
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:09,040
terms of the frameworks that we were

645
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:10,389
doing so we taught it to contact textual

646
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,850
words that we cared about it was good at

647
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:15,670
pulling those out the PCI has a whole

648
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:18,520
different set of contextual words the

649
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:22,350
machine learned that if we didn't tell

650
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:27,010
the ML framework how to deal right so

651
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:29,110
part of the reason that match the system

652
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:31,210
model is because there is a lot of

653
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:36,699
context in terms of PCI the machine

654
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:39,570
learning just didn't even like even

655
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:45,640
though they share some of the same

656
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:45,639
[Music]

657
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,299
[Music]

658
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:43,000
we do probably find a way to tie into

659
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:43,000
that just as a resource

660
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:56,949

661
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:12,470
yeah so what I anticipate if there's an

662
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,779
organization that really wanted to go

663
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,450
this road right they probably want to

664
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:20,630
update or standardize the format of

665
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:23,299
security addendum the receive in person

666
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:27,549
so that it matches the format that's

667
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:30,549
consumed by this and ultimately the GRCC

668
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:30,549
similarly

669
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,489
[Music]

670
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,590
yeah so so just not just to make sure

671
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,600
everyone good here so the question was

672
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:19,970
were we waiting the different keywords

673
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,950
differently as part of the comparison so

674
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,990
maybe the action itself the action

675
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,640
matches that's worth 60 percent of the

676
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,229
equation and if the target matches it's

677
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,060
worth an additional 30 percent hood you

678
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,250
know we don't know

679
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:35,060
so the short answer is no not in this

680
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:37,040
pass but that's absolutely used we go

681
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:40,790
forward tuning because that's another

682
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,730
critical component the y2g your pointer

683
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:46,250
question for why certain things are

684
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:48,470
currently seeming to be a match at the

685
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,060
same way but they're not because they

686
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,839
might have matched on a context jeweler

687
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:55,040
but the action in target and those

688
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,970
should be weighted higher so that's

689
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,970
certainly part of the tuning

695
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:56,960
what is recovery what the word for this

696
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,430
control actually means what its

697
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,540
inventory mean here's it something that

698
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:09,410
you're doing or is it something that's

699
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:11,270
so what you have to do that once you

700
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:13,399
pick enough of those words it'll

701
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,660
automatically aggressive the words for

702
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,000
you I think it's gonna be pretty

703
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,500
insistently a manual thing so that was

704
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,050
part of our intent here to to see what

705
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,820
we can make happen once we teach it

706
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:40,949
enough stuff or we get done online

710
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,009
well

711
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,910
but you're but you're absolutely not

712
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:10,770
wrong because it's part of doing this

713
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,029
thinking about other works or ways the

714
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,109
data might be used in one of the things

715
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,300
that we sort of thought about sort of

716
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:17,279
like the Aristotle form control

717
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,000
framework what's that look once you

718
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:27,119
smoosh all this stuff together right

719
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:29,160
maybe not sibling of ML being the AI

720
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,750
step or use usual paths right and

721
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,540
sometimes future caste gives you like a

722
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:37,470
pizza recipe that's like mushrooms and

723
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,790
tomatoes but one of the things that we

724
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,459
thought about doing once we get this a

725
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:44,040
little burn is seeing if we can get the

726
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:47,340
machine to automatically spit out what

727
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:57,900
the sort of more combination of controls

728
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:59,400
looks like we're not necessarily forcing

729
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,130
the big standards bodies to become

730
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:07,100
standardized right but seeing if we can

731
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:07,100
develop something as a side for right

732
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:33,569
another standard

you could utilize more arrogance

processes right to to validate things

738
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:09,210
that the team is doing in terms of know

739
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,100
the manual mappings in turn or even like

740
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,760
for risks to control do you pick your

741
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:16,899
two things that are comparable
