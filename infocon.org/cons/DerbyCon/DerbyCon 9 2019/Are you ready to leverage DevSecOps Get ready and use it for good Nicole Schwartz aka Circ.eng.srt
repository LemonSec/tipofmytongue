1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
hey everybody I'm Nicole Schwartz I'm

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,420
the product manager for the secure

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,670
composition and now Lissa's team I get

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,160
lab also known as I write security tools

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,990
for security people to use I'm an idol

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,599
advocate and I've been a hacker since at

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,820
least high school so we're gonna be

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,850
talking about software life cycle well

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,330
why do devs do what the they do and

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,539
what is shift left meme and why does

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,970
this apply to me we're security actually

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,529
fits into the whole dev psyche ops thing

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,729
and how do you actually get people

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,620
training so that they're not just

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,578
running off and doing things randomly

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,070
that you don't know what they are so

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,350
software development is hard your job is

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,750
hard but their job is also hard and it's

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,640
gotten a lot harder we've started

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,980
introducing Portability like containers

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,949
and we've said ok well now you need to

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,239
understand micro services and zero trust

23
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,920
because you're about to deploy into

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,230
places where you don't know what else is

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,180
there and you can't just trust

26
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,760
everything that is a part of your

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,799
network anymore and also you need to go

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,270
faster cuz we need to do deploys every

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,430
single week and I need a new feature oh

30
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,490
and by the way you have to do your own

31
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,510
unit tests and regression tests and

32
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,939
security we think we want you to do some

33
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,799
security testing too none of this got

34
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,270
taught to developers in schools so they

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,750
just suddenly had all this put on their

36
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,149
plates

37
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,280
I mean none of this is a bad thing it

38
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,130
just means writing modern software is

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,420
pretty complex you know in a lot of

40
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,020
cases they're going to be using agile

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,479
and DevOps together DevOps is a practice

42
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,880
how are we doing the thing an agile is a

43
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,490
process we're going to do it following

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,158
these principles both of them focus on

45
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,259
how do we avoid tossing work over the

46
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,729
wall so if I'm the developer I used to

47
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,159
be like write my code write my code hey

48
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,869
testing there you go come back to me in

49
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,399
a month I'll take care of it and then

50
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,750
months later you get the bugs and then

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,280
you're like gosh what was I doing

52
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:59,219
when that bug happened oh so we're

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,780
trying to reduce that by having in both

54
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,759
agile and DevOps your team actually

55
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,729
understand a little bit about testing

56
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,619
for quality for performance for

57
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,359
following spec and also doing a little

58
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,889
bit of security testing what is a

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,870
cross-site script well there's this open

60
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,230
source tool and if I

61
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:17,510
it'll tell me I have one how do I fix it

62
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,849
so though agile and DevOps are not the

63
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,649
same they're very complementary and they

64
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,329
both grown in popularity in recent years

65
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,260
speaking of growing in popularity

66
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:29,329
they're trendy trendy isn't necessarily

67
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,500
bad but it certainly means a lot of

68
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:32,269
people are going to read some medium

69
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,530
articles and they are now the new expert

70
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:35,000
on dev sec ops and we're going to

71
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,709
implement it and we're not gonna do any

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,299
training and I'm sure you know exactly

73
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:39,980
how well that goes and you might be

74
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,310
inflicted with some of that within your

75
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,140
corporation so if everyone says we're

76
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,269
going to do agile or we're going to do

77
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,250
DevOps or dev psych ops what you need to

78
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:51,650
do is make sure hey can we all get

79
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,510
training so we're all on the same page

80
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,980
can we all at least understand the terms

81
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,440
that we're using and what we're aiming

82
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,790
for so that we have shared objectives

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,280
and by the way security is now a success

84
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,828
metric so can we make sure that with all

85
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,810
the planning security is involved so I

86
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:11,810
can ask for what I want because if I'm a

87
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,329
success metric I as the security team

88
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:17,269
would really love to get a say in what

89
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:19,310
that metric is and by the way remember

90
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:22,220
everything focuses on really small fast

91
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,290
features so you want to come in and

92
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,540
actually have a list of ideas that can

93
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,250
be implemented in small releases so they

94
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,720
don't just go oh that's really big well

95
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,879
how about we do this instead we read

96
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,290
about this have some small ideas for

97
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,730
them to start with to get them to

98
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,929
realize that you're playing on the same

99
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:41,500
team also she have two left everything

100
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:42,799
is going to the left now left of what

101
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,480
well

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,040
software development lifecycle has a

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,578
couple steps you have requirements

104
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,560
design code test deployment maintenance

105
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:53,660
maintenance is important lots of people

106
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,510
forget it for some reason what you're

107
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,400
trying to do is consider each one of the

108
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,040
steps and how you test for those steps

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,169
much earlier in the process during

110
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,448
requirements can you actually plan for

111
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:08,359
some security items and some testing

112
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:10,400
items when you're designing can you

113
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:12,440
reuse architecture that the security

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,599
team has already signed off on do you

115
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,969
make it easy for your architects in the

116
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,620
company to see what security designs

117
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,969
have already been signed off for for

118
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,070
similar projects that they could just

119
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:24,639
reuse instead of having to continually

120
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,800
reinvent the wheel or keep having to get

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,650
proved similar but only slightly

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,180
different architectures so if you want

123
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,919
to get considered earlier you have to

124
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,529
make your life a little bit easier for

125
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,960
the product managers and the architects

126
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:40,270
by the way we're not actually getting

127
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,039
rid of security testers for quality

128
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,219
testers you're just trying to automate

129
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,110
some of the low-hanging fruit so this

130
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:49,509
isn't all about like Oh taking away

131
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:53,499
people's jobs it's about writing better

132
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:56,520
quality stuff which brings me to test

133
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:58,599
everything so the benefits

134
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,188
vulnerabilities get found earlier and

135
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:01,449
remember that whole like tossed over the

136
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:03,550
wall comes back in a month and what the

137
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:05,710
hell was I doing have you ever had to

138
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,870
work on two projects at a time maybe to

139
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,120
you know incidents or to assessments

140
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,650
it's kind of annoying to jump back and

141
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,719
forth like Oh what was I doing over here

142
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,250
and oh what was I thinking when I wrote

143
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:17,110
that note like I thought that note was

144
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,389
gonna be really useful to me later and I

145
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,159
kind of forget the context building that

146
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:22,569
context and being able to do that is

147
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:23,889
really important and developers when

148
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:27,849
they get something from a month ago it's

149
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:31,689
like when I did that form what was I

150
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:33,219
smoking yeah I don't I don't remember so

151
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,479
what was that bug crap well maybe I'll

152
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:36,550
just rewrite it again and interview some

153
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,039
new bug so if we're finding it really

154
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,659
fast then I will hopefully still be in

155
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,188
the same context and be able to fix it

156
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,139
or at least tell you what I was thinking

157
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:46,740
and maybe security and help me tell me

158
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:48,639
how to do it a little bit better so

159
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,379
developers are now on board for

160
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,279
automating some of these security tests

161
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:56,830
and that means that you can be like hey

162
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:58,149
how about this asks can a majority of

163
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,649
our bugs seem to be like simple

164
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:02,289
cross-site scripting stuff that'll catch

165
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:04,569
it or hey a lot of our stuff is

166
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:05,919
dependency based problems we're using a

167
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,439
lot of third-party libraries that are

168
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,969
really out of date can we just do a

169
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:11,500
dependency scan every time you add

170
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,149
something and it'll tell you that

171
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,610
there's known vulnerability there or

172
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:17,740
it's kind of really behind so that

173
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,750
before you use the library extensively

174
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,039
all over the place you can just try and

175
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,960
grab the new one and see if that works

176
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,479
instead of having to back for it later

177
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,628
and forking don't let them fork that

178
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:31,240
idea all right

179
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:32,430
so security is code you've probably

180
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,139
heard this

181
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,680
what do you mean security is code well

182
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:36,320
think about it

183
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,880
ever

184
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,099
in the cloud now is right this config

185
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,150
file and poof it deploys itself into a

186
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,460
whole new environment

187
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,099
and a lot of those environments GCP na

188
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,570
WS have security settings so that means

189
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,430
that I'm writing a bunch of security

190
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,640
settings whether I realize it or not as

191
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,460
part of my deployment and that's code to

192
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,440
me I'm checking it into the repo and you

193
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,500
know chef puppet whatever else is

194
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,510
pushing it out there so as a security

195
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,310
person you should know where are these

196
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,900
config files are going who's writing

197
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,520
them and if they actually have bothered

198
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,690
to read or understand any of the

199
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,270
security settings in your cloud provider

200
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,190
and maybe give them some advice like hey

201
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,870
I made this default config file and

202
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,160
here's my recommended settings if you

203
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,690
want to deviate from there can we have a

204
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,310
conversation about it I'd love to have a

205
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,440
library of pre-approved ones that you

206
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,520
can use so if they're responsible for

207
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,400
doing all of these deployments

208
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,659
themselves you can help them by being

209
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,590
like look I've made a whole library of

210
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,730
these for you you don't have to think

211
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,289
about it just pick one of these because

212
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,880
I labeled this one web app and I labeled

213
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,680
this one mobile app should make your

214
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,110
life easy and they're not going to then

215
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,110
just leave the password off the s3

216
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,490
bucket or something

217
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,230
speaking of we've got a lot of different

218
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,000
people that are accountable for

219
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,400
different areas of security you've now

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,730
got your own internal teams and your

221
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,849
cloud provider and you know this adds

222
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,210
complexity you need to figure out make a

223
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,220
list

224
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:58,789
whatever I got who's responsible for it

225
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,740
and then how do I verify they may say

226
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,450
they're doing something what are they

227
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,580
telling you the truth can you

228
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,469
occasionally check up on that make sure

229
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,450
they're not just bullshitting you and

230
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,460
being like yeah we did that thing now

231
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,260
third-party providers internal teams

232
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,430
everyone can you occasionally make sure

233
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:18,860
they're actually doing what they said

234
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,600
also you need to scale because remember

235
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,190
we're going really fast now and you

236
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,360
probably have spun up a bunch of tiny

237
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,890
little dev teams and they're going a

238
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,360
million different directions you

239
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,860
personally don't scale or if you do

240
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,010
please let me know how I'd love a couple

241
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,750
clones so you need to target the

242
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,460
automation where it matters and get each

243
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,740
one of those teams where is the biggest

244
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,300
risk for that team well they're writing

245
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,039
a web app and it doesn't collect any

246
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,870
money and it doesn't store any PII so

247
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,289
yeah whatever you can do a basic web

248
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,070
scan

249
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,769
y'all have PII

250
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,079
let's talk about that or your the

251
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,730
internal HR server can we keep you off

252
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,019
the network or can we like make sure

253
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,759
it's really restricted with who has

254
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,160
access and can we make sure we do you

255
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,190
know much more testing on that

256
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:02,579
so remember security is now one of the

257
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,920
requirements dev SEC ups get that

258
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:06,180
planned into the projects go to product

259
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,040
and be like well since you know we're

260
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,050
one of the KPIs now can we make sure

261
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,670
that we've got a couple weeks set aside

262
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,500
to do the automation at the beginning or

263
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,569
the middle do not let them wait till the

264
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,110
end because if you matter you're in the

265
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:20,459
begin here in the middle all right so

266
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,970
you are secure and you're in the middle

267
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:25,920
oh okay how exactly do we get here well

268
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,839
the business basically just told you

269
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,329
that they care about you and they're on

270
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,279
board and so now you just need to get

271
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:34,199
the engineers to know what the heck that

272
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,329
means remember they didn't get trained

273
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,519
on this in school and security is now

274
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:40,589
everyone's job the call center needs to

275
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,449
not get social engineered the developers

276
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:43,769
not didn't need to put in backdoors

277
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,060
you know maybe you need to make sure

278
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:46,680
that people wander around the building

279
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,349
close the door behind them you don't let

280
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,540
people into the server there's a good

281
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,069
point Mandodari I say surprise surprise

282
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,420
who would have thought that that

283
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:57,300
security must become everyone's

284
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,279
responsibility and it has to be a normal

285
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,880
part of everyone's process again

286
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,880
security is everyone's job perfect is

287
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,260
the enemy of good enough you're never

288
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,480
going to get perfect with any year

289
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,920
departments or internally so what can be

290
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,360
good enough what can make them better

291
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,849
than they are today

292
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,019
make everyone include security in their

293
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:21,839
processes they're gonna get kind of back

294
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,699
to you where exactly the security gates

295
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,540
should be if you want to call it that if

296
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:25,979
you look over there we've got the

297
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,430
developer they're working on their

298
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,800
little mrs when we talk to developers so

299
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,449
i'm at get lab remember they actually

300
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,990
want to write quality code they want to

301
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:39,870
be proud of the code that they write and

302
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,149
if they can in their mr actually see i

303
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,310
had some security bugs let me fix them i

304
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:46,110
had some quality bugs let me fix them or

305
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,939
hey i didn't have any bugs and i know

306
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,800
because this was on just my mr any of

307
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:51,569
those things that come back or not one

308
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,729
of my teammate so introduce that it's me

309
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:56,069
and so i'm responsible for that and if I

310
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,350
can't fix it I can escalate to May

311
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,020
a person on my team is a little more

312
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,160
knowledgeable or the security department

313
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,569
and having them be able to iterate and

314
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,550
clear all those errors means there's

315
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,530
less for you to review in your security

316
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,430
tools by the time it gets later into the

317
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:13,770
environment so help them to be proud of

318
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,260
their work because let's circle back

319
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:19,350
your business is in business to get

320
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,210
money out of people the people want to

321
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,380
buy the product the developers want to

322
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,440
make the product that everyone's proud

323
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,420
to buy it doesn't crash it's usable and

324
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,800
you want to make sure that it doesn't

325
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,209
end up in the news so everyone doesn't

326
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,979
go home is that that company the cup

327
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,020
reached I'm not sure I want to give them

328
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,060
my data so you all are on the same side

329
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,040
have a product people like are not

330
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,000
afraid of and fork over money and you

331
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,980
all get paychecks so reminder there

332
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,360
could get lub just saying that because

333
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,750
you're about to hear a whole bunch of

334
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,030
stuff about me so when you've got all of

335
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,940
these tools maybe of JIRA maybe a bit

336
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:56,579
bucket maybe you've got github you can

337
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,770
have Trello Microsoft TFS all sorts of

338
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,110
things every single tool that you have

339
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:05,449
there's probably an opportunity to

340
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:08,100
integrate in a third-party point

341
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,440
security system so there's a ton of

342
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,000
silver bullets out there but they you

343
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,850
should probably serve one particular

344
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,270
area so can you get some static scans

345
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:20,790
into whatever your code repo is can you

346
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:23,189
get some dynamic scans into your testing

347
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,110
environment or your deployment area can

348
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,840
you make sure before you're deploying

349
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,670
you've got container checks going in

350
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,010
create stage can you check your

351
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,870
dependencies if you have a lot of legal

352
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,150
compliance issues can you check for

353
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,620
license compliance are we using licenses

354
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,240
that were permitted to use is the type

355
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,460
of entity that we are that's probably

356
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,190
going to be over in create and verify so

357
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,500
get items worked in throughout your

358
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,660
process there are plenty of open-source

359
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,760
tools and if you go ahead on Twitter I'm

360
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,370
going to post these later and you can

361
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,990
integrate in open-source third-party

362
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,970
tools if you want to be able to see them

363
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,350
or if you don't have a lot of budget yet

364
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,790
you just need to prove that they work

365
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,580
before you can move to a paid solution

366
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,750
there's also things out there like white

367
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,060
source and

368
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,180
Blackduck that'll also do similar items

369
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,609
but you can also be lazy get lebas all

370
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,800
baked in already so you can turn on sass

371
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,129
- secret detection dependency scans

372
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,969
container scans and license compliance

373
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,350
without having to do any of that

374
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,790
integration without having to worry

375
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,259
about the fact that you're managing how

376
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,849
many different logins for how many

377
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:28,620
different people and what that security

378
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:30,629
stuff is but the important part is where

379
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,949
can you fit it in and every single one

380
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:34,529
of your tool sets and put in those

381
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:36,599
checks remember verify and reduce risk

382
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,680
what is the boring stuff that you can

383
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,230
just make go away and check on reports

384
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,370
all right training so everyone's excited

385
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,300
they're gonna start doing sass cans

386
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,310
they're going to get something and it's

387
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,930
gonna say that's a sequel injection and

388
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:52,050
they're gonna be like what's a sequel

389
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,519
injection well you probably torture them

390
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,680
with Aiwass training once a year because

391
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,410
you have to anyway right so there's a

392
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,899
budget for training somewhere and dev

393
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,480
psych ops hey look this is now priority

394
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,910
for the engineering team hey engineering

395
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,459
team you need to set aside a budget to

396
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:11,160
do some training checkout vda labs

397
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:13,469
hunter to code bashing there's a lot of

398
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,850
online or in-person training that you

399
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,829
can have your developers take that is

400
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,449
code specific because if you give them

401
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:20,099
some general class they're gonna guy

402
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:21,899
don't really know how this applies to me

403
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,519
but if you're writing in Python give

404
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,199
them Python training if they're writing

405
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,209
in c-sharp give them c-sharp training

406
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,939
make it relevant they actually know

407
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:31,349
what's going on alright you've told them

408
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:32,910
a little bit about here is how you write

409
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:36,360
secure code here are some security

410
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:39,029
principles well why don't you also think

411
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,350
like an attacker I mean a lot of times

412
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,089
when you're learning something doesn't

413
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,920
it stick better when you know like okay

414
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,269
why do I lock the front door well

415
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,769
because if I don't my sister's gonna

416
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:49,680
open my door come in and take my

417
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:50,970
right well if I'm a developer why do I

418
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,989
care if this thing's here well because

419
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,149
somebody's gonna put in you know a

420
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,769
little symbol here and a little similar

421
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:59,040
here and then all the stuff comes out

422
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,540
well okay how did they do that can we

423
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,610
teach them some burp suite some nets

424
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,779
Parker can we run them through some

425
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,180
other kind of stuff so that they're

426
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,980
actually able to be like haha now I know

427
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,300
why that matters and you actually made

428
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,279
me fix it the trick is

429
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,469
for everyone other than basic training

430
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,820
to go to maybe more advanced training

431
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,350
you're gonna want to get volunteers

432
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:22,550
because the people who don't volunteer

433
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,959
are gonna put it at the bottom of their

434
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,959
list and I'm gonna be like I don't

435
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:28,160
really care about this but even if they

436
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,420
do volunteer you've got to make it a

437
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,250
little fun can you have some kind of

438
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,689
board in the office for like here's the

439
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,760
people who have fixed the most number of

440
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,860
bugs in our software that were security

441
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,500
related or here's the people who

442
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,140
actually found vulnerabilities in some

443
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,720
of our older projects you know and fix

444
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,410
those and we didn't even scan those can

445
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,750
you give them stickers what about coffee

446
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,610
donuts pizza it's gotta be something

447
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,040
figure out what everybody likes and give

448
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,779
it to them or is their local b-sides can

449
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,660
you send them to a local b-sides

450
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:02,570
conference to actually attend talks play

451
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,860
in a CTF maybe if you have a good enough

452
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:07,160
training program they can even give a

453
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:10,490
talk which gets into the self-paced

454
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:14,000
learning so what about having a CTF team

455
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:16,640
at work could you get one day each month

456
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,990
where everyone does a CTF together could

457
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,910
you have some lunch and learns where you

458
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,620
and they talk about things that you

459
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,110
learned in the CTF the latest breach

460
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,959
maybe some cool new tool that came out

461
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,579
or you just went to a conference how

462
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,930
many good YouTube videos are there can

463
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,459
you have some repo that you're sharing

464
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,319
all the good YouTube videos with one

465
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:34,760
another so that's a new person comes in

466
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,930
they have the experience of like going

467
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,000
through and seeing like oh I'm kind of

468
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,680
interested in you know this particular

469
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,480
area oh hey you already have like 10

470
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,479
suggested videos for me this is perfect

471
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:49,670
all right so hopefully I've got

472
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,910
everybody on board here where you now

473
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:55,699
have the stick where I matter you can't

474
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:58,250
just put me in the backlog and that

475
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:00,709
means that you have to remind everyone

476
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,880
politely we're on the same team we want

477
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,859
people to give us money and buy our

478
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,390
product they want to trust our product

479
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,620
and to trust our product that means it

480
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,750
needs to work when we say it's going to

481
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:12,530
work and it needs to not give away all

482
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:14,419
of their information and a bad product

483
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,730
or breach could cost us a lot of money

484
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:18,319
or our jobs if we're a small enough

485
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,829
company it could completely put us out

486
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,569
of business so let's set this time aside

487
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,139
for some automation for some training

488
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,490
and

489
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,100
maybe even for growing security

490
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,900
advocates these security advocates can

491
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:31,699
eventually become security team members

492
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,590
or even if they don't do that they can

493
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,510
at least be an escalation point and they

494
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,459
can save you time from having to answer

495
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,350
all of the same questions because

496
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,940
they're embedded within the team they'll

497
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,250
also maybe notice some things and be

498
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,780
your eyes and ears and if they notice it

499
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,280
and bring it up to you you might think

500
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,020
this project that was innocuous and

501
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,670
really shouldn't be high-risk ah

502
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:54,680
you're connecting to what so use

503
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:57,320
security advocates and also trust but

504
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,610
verify your third party one of your

505
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,520
development team says they're doing

506
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:05,449
something are they really just

507
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:09,950
occasionally check in randomly and

508
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:11,960
finally get it baked in as early as

509
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,320
possible when you're doing the design

510
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,380
phase even can you make security part of

511
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:22,730
the original design instead of tacked on

512
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:24,440
afterwards and when you can can you have

513
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,690
it when they're literally doing their

514
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,250
merge requests don't wait until all the

515
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,380
codes ready and going to production when

516
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:32,810
they do that mr can you immediately do

517
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,360
the scan reminder we've got that big din

518
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,889
and then makes your product in

519
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,740
engineering or setting that time aside

520
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:42,350
not just oh yeah we put you in there

521
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,780
you're coming up okay how many Sprint's

522
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:47,780
during this quarter which sprint are we

523
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:50,149
going to be at or if you're doing daily

524
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,040
releases can we pick a certain day by

525
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:55,100
the 15th of each month can we have you

526
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,300
know at least one automation task in by

527
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,810
the first part of the month and one end

528
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:05,389
by the last part of the month and next

529
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:07,010
encourage people grow them you don't

530
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,780
know who your next security team member

531
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,010
is going to be and just think how many

532
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,510
times is it when somebody on the

533
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,680
security teams like I really wish I

534
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,879
understood this language a little bit

535
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,530
better so we could dig into this

536
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,940
wouldn't it be nice have you got someone

537
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,040
who used to be a developer and edit on

538
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,390
the languages or wouldn't it be nice if

539
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,830
you just had a bunch of really excited

540
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,290
developers who are doing a lot of your

541
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,179
first level triaging of vulnerabilities

542
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,730
for you instead of you having to triage

543
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,990
all of them so get them on your side get

544
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,540
them excited give them some doughnuts

545
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,490
whatever it takes

546
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,379
so finally feedback if you would like to

547
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,270
click a QR code go for it

548
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,059
otherwise there is a Google form link

549
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,160
and again this will be up on my Twitter

550
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:57,740
so I think I might have time for a

551
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:59,600
question in there too yes so what we're

552
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,130
doing is we have something Oh

553
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,428
so the question is how are we getting

554
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:07,160
dynamic analysis in when people do the

555
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:09,500
mr so every time an mr is built the

556
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,809
pipeline builds a review app which think

557
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,720
of it as like an instantly built QA

558
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:16,549
environment and then the verify stage

559
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,220
runs all of the quality tests and

560
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:22,908
dynamic tests and coming soon fuzzing

561
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:26,179
tests against that area and whenever it

562
00:20:22,909 --> 00:20:27,980
finds something if it's related to or if

563
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:33,950
it is a new find as opposed to an old

564
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:37,549
find it will associate it to that mr so

565
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:39,679
it runs it against everything but it

566
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:43,418
dismisses or it doesn't show you

567
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,919
anything that was already found before

568
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:47,870
so it's kind of just there is a library

569
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,130
and you keep stacking things into the

570
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,229
library and it's like oh I'm just not

571
00:20:49,130 --> 00:21:04,220
going to show you those right now so

572
00:20:51,230 --> 00:21:10,190
yeah so the question is how do we find

573
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:14,179
that difference I guess it's Delta all

574
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,650
right again always I think how long does

575
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:19,610
that take what the question really

576
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:23,419
depends on how big your codebase is so

577
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:26,389
you can say don't block on the results

578
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:28,039
of this so let it completely and then

579
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:32,620
we'll get the feedback quickly but we

580
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:36,140
won't block the build so all right

581
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:38,989
awesome hopefully everyone can now like

582
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,340
get security built into your DevOps tool

583
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,340
chain Thanks
