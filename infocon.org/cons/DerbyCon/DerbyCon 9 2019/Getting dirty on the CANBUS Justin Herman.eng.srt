1
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:12,629
all right well thank everyone for coming

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,940
down my name is Justin and I am gonna be

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,660
talking about the canvas specifically

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,789
canvas in automotive applications it's a

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,830
little bit about me my name is obviously

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,289
Justin I go by J dog Herman on Twitter

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,028
you can also find me on key bass I'm an

8
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,590
active board member of the neo Northeast

9
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,740
Ohio information security forum which is

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,590
a group that's been going on for about

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,660
12 years I think maybe more in Cleveland

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,059
region and if you guys are ever in the

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,980
area you're looking to sit in one of our

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,750
meetings just reach out to me

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,569
I'm a penetration tester in the finance

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,440
industry I'm into electronics and ham

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,329
radio and also a big board game geek so

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,610
if you ever want to talk to me late at

19
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,770
night you talking about those things and

20
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,350
I'll talk forever so you have been

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,270
warned I am NOT an expert in this I

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,019
don't claim to be I don't pretend to be

23
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,350
I'm not I'm not responsible for any of

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:12,060
the troubles or anything you do to your

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:15,570
cars or anyone elses cars or a rental of

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,150
cars or anything else I am not I'm not

27
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,189
don't follow what I'm saying the

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:27,200
opinions are my own enough not of my

29
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:32,789
employer so last year I drove a pretty

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,780
non remarkable car it's in 1996 if I'm

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,689
know if you guys remember the Ford

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,280
Aspire it's this very small hatchback

33
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:41,220
looks like a shoe and drives down the

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,710
road it has nothing fun in it to be able

35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,880
to really get advanced information from

36
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,139
you got basic Oh to be - hardly any

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,710
other information you can really draw

38
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,140
from that so last year I got myself a

39
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:59,250
newer car this time a little bit older

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,140
but it meant that I could have a new toy

41
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,149
and I could go ahead and take things

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,600
apart and figure out how far it can go

43
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:09,060
with this car hacking thing that was

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,169
available so when I began I was looking

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,239
for

46
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,470
obviously the vector to get in to the

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,600
system and that's of course the

48
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,359
to port right everybody uses those you

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,310
in Ohio we plug in you get emissions

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,730
testing that to say if your check engine

51
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,840
lights on you don't pass and so on it

52
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,329
support I didn't know much about the

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,730
connector itself so what I found to my

54
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,620
research was the SAE defined it the

55
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,760
connector as a J 1692 it has 16 pins

56
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,060
it's sometimes called the data link

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,769
connector and my specifications is

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,970
supposed to be no more than 2 feet from

59
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,959
the steering wheel I'm not supposed to

60
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:48,330
be requiring tools to access now my car

61
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,650
specifically leverages some other pins

62
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:56,120
but the standard that's standardized

63
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:59,570
connections are to use the 1850 with SAE

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:03,660
for both pin and pin pin 2 and pin 10

65
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:08,940
ground on 4 and 5 both first chassis and

66
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:15,240
signal along with iso 15 765 - 4 can bus

67
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:18,239
high on 6 pin 14 has the iso 715 765 - 4

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,010
for the low and then of course the both

69
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,590
the k line and outline and a 12 volt

70
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,290
power supply i don't know what any of

71
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,540
this men and so I started trying to look

72
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,859
into find more information and what I

73
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,870
found was that the SI j 1850 which is on

74
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,100
pen 2 and pin 10 those are really

75
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,830
designed for the Fords they use pulp

76
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,810
width modulation to control it well GM's

77
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:48,480
leveraged a variable pulse width the ISO

78
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:55,830
1990 141 - 2 is for Chrysler European

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:58,920
and Asian cars and the ISO 14 234 K line

80
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,080
and L line were for other other types of

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,070
vehicles that weren't included there

82
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
what a cool point that I found about

83
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,850
this is that not all of these connectors

84
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,590
are the same there's actually a second

85
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,590
specification that's out there which

86
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,769
permits for 24 volt applications and in

87
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:16,190
that case there's actually a divider in

88
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:21,120
the middle which doesn't allow the

89
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:23,340
insertion of the male plug so open u2

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,950
was required in bicarb which is the

91
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,859
California Air Resources Board back in

92
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:32,009
1991

93
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:34,360
and that's really was pushed by forward

94
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:37,210
emissions missions testing they were

95
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,520
having obviously bad emission issues in

96
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:43,448
1970s 1980s and California's always

97
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,719
trying to lead that that the champion

98
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:50,229
that and so in 1981 they required some

99
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:53,319
sort of on-board diagnostics in the u.s.

100
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:56,919
all cars built after 1996 had to have

101
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:59,319
ODB two and it was primarily used for

102
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:03,639
diagnostic support information regarding

103
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:04,629
again just emissions and at this point I

104
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:07,120
got a little confused trying to

105
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:08,889
understand what ODB 2 was versus can

106
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,169
I've heard both of these together and

107
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,240
what I found was that the ODB 2 is

108
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:16,779
basically just sits on top of the can

109
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:20,289
bus it's a it's an language as you could

110
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:21,729
maybe say that would be able to

111
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:30,520
communicate in certain standardized

112
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:34,500
parameters can which was the 15 765 - 4

113
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,400
was required after 2008 for all cars so

114
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,469
if you're thinking about doing this

115
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,669
getting into hacking on cars or having

116
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:42,849
some fun and figure out what's out there

117
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:44,469
and doing some fuzzing having a newer

118
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:50,680
car obviously is gonna offer a lot more

119
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:52,419
features so what happened nobody won

120
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,770
well DVD one didn't actually exist that

121
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:58,599
was manufacturer manufacturer in

122
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,688
specific manufacturer specific to

123
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:03,550
whatever their whims were I've had a

124
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:06,400
vehicle that actually required me to put

125
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,500
a jumper a piece of wire over a port

126
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,258
that was that looked like an oak db2

127
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,550
connector as they say and instead the

128
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:13,870
check engine light would flash in

129
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,979
certain sequences and that would tell

130
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:20,460
you your error code that was available

131
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:24,128
again usually those were again for just

132
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:26,589
emissions testing so the cam bus was

133
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:30,310
actually designed in bosch in the 1980s

134
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:34,899
and uh 1991 they released both a can 2.0

135
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:39,780
a and it can 2.0 B this is again this

136
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:43,600
this was adopted in 1993 by a bi so 11

137
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:46,840
898 the ISO standard now the difference

138
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,320
between a and B is actually the address

139
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,810
length in a you get 11 bits of data for

140
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,060
address and then B you get 29 bits

141
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,580
addressing when you think about like the

142
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,120
OSI model the canvas it's basically in

143
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,789
the in the data link in physical layer

144
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,210
while ODB 2 would be more transport and

145
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:08,620
network so the three different three

146
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,979
different standards that were

147
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:15,760
established out there's 11 898 - 2 for

148
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,590
high-speed this was a binary 1 4 which

149
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,000
is considered dominant apart so we buy

150
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,960
number 0 which is considered dominant

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,280
it's when it's driven low for a low

152
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,320
signal and then driven high where high

153
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,640
signal binary one reason recessive and

154
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:33,219
it commonly floated at I'd run 2.5 volts

155
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:38,680
and when it would return back it would

156
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:42,790
they both return to the 2.5 and I so 11

157
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,930
+ 8 98 - 3 there's a low speed signaling

158
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,670
and I'll show you a little more about

159
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:50,380
that signal and how that one works and

160
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,970
then like so 15 7 6 5 - 4 is the one

161
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:57,690
we're really going to be talking about

162
00:07:51,970 --> 00:08:00,900
and that is a form of the 11 898 - -

163
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,900
it's complicated

164
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,370
so cane can bus high-speed again this is

165
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,310
that high-speed was talking about

166
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,470
there's a differential between both the

167
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:14,530
high voltage and low voltage and both

168
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:18,460
signals the high and low are driven to

169
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,960
their respective voltage potentials it

170
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:24,370
signifies a zero and then when to return

171
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:26,830
they signify a 1 and that's how this

172
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,340
high speed ISO standard was established

173
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,780
this is again we're using high speed

174
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:35,319
network was all on them on a

175
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,970
standardized bus system they had a stub

176
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,790
length of no more and the standard is no

177
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,740
more than 30 centimeters linear bus is

178
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:45,670
terminated at both ends the 120 ohm

179
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:48,010
resistors and everything needed to be

180
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,620
basically and a line and connected up

181
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,750
they did come out with again the low

182
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,370
speed option

183
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,250
which allowed the node individual nodes

184
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,620
to terminate and actually bring up their

185
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,350
resistance both ground and their five

186
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,050
volts but the total resistance on that

187
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,780
was around 100 ohms and with no more

188
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:11,469
than each node having at least 5 ohms of

189
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:14,500
resistance this speed for the high speed

190
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,660
is 500 K and I think I said that sort of

191
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,300
length could be about 40 meters with the

192
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:23,620
low speed you're talking about 30 to 125

193
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,359
K bits so low speed you were driving

194
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,060
individualized signals which are closer

195
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,790
to five and closer to zero and inversing

196
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,310
them now that time for that collapse of

197
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,150
the signal is real reason why we have to

198
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:39,270
slow down the transmit data transfer

199
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:43,480
that can actually occur

200
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:46,210
low speed it can work in a start or mesh

201
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,580
topology it's far more flexible but

202
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,260
again you've got that low speed and when

203
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,690
you are talking about certain systems in

204
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,400
your car high speed is gonna be

205
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,190
necessary for like your engine control

206
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,270
and transmission and brakes and so on

207
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,280
and so forth of all the low speed

208
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,310
systems can be lessee eaters and the

209
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,670
instrument cluster and radio more

210
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,079
creature comforts in the cabin so those

211
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,560
four types of frames that exist on the

212
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,360
can base network there are data for

213
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,239
sending obviously data the remote which

214
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,210
is to request data errors and overloads

215
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:24,430
and errors and reloads are basically

216
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:25,930
sisters of one another it when you have

217
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,969
an error of the system if it detects one

218
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,449
during a frame session it will go ahead

219
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,430
and transmit six dominance which is our

220
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,200
zeros followed by eight recessive ones

221
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,260
and then followed by two inter frame

222
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,050
spacing of at least three dominance if

223
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,360
the system detects needs more time

224
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,240
between neural processing it will create

225
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,940
an overload which is the exact same

226
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:55,540
signal as the error but not in between a

227
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:57,010
data frame or remote frame if if in each

228
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,530
node is there working on the system

229
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,540
locks to keep a tally of how many errors

230
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:06,010
that they're occurring and if they see

231
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:08,410
less than 128 they will

232
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:11,400
go ahead and send active airframe if

233
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:15,040
either if their transmit or receive

234
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,600
receives more than 250 that put a

235
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,599
passive frame which means they actually

236
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,990
don't transmit they just sit for the

237
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,930
allotted time and if the transmit is

238
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:28,000
greater than 255 the device just stops

239
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,699
participating all together in the the

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,180
network until it's reset for most types

241
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,890
of notes so dataframe starts out with

242
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,719
obviously the starter frame

243
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,699
it marks the beginning of the data and

244
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,070
the remote signals I'm not sure if you

245
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,050
can see this oh well it is but that's

246
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:47,140
the portion just little white the green

247
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,449
is arbitration field and this includes

248
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,520
the message message ID and the remote

249
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,470
transmission request bit which that

250
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,689
determines whether or not this frame is

251
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:59,950
a remote request or a standard data

252
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:02,650
frame identify also the identifier is an

253
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:08,500
arbitration field that can be the again

254
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:11,650
the 11 bits or it can go to 29

255
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:15,280
the next is a control field which is

256
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:18,040
just reserved and user determine this

257
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,720
are those reserved bit and then there is

258
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,760
a control field and it's used to

259
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:27,160
determine the data size and the message

260
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,150
ID length so loops so in a frame if you

261
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,860
want to set if you want to send

262
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,800
additional data beyond the payload

263
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:37,170
that's lauded in its data field you

264
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,939
would send a one in that control field

265
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:42,760
versus you sending a zero which is a

266
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,720
very single frame each subsequent frame

267
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:50,439
would get a 2 instead of a 1 and flow

268
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,290
control frames which help determine the

269
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,650
speed and accuracy those are three and

270
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,870
then four and five fourth and 15 are

271
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:02,319
reserved data field this is actually

272
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:05,500
where the data goes and really only

273
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,440
applies to data frames and not remote

274
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,700
frames CRC field as a checksum that's

275
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,910
available to help to determine that the

276
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:15,490
message was not garbled was received and

277
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,930
then you'll have an acknowledgment along

278
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,420
with a delimiter and then an end of

279
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,420
frame all date can bus

280
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,560
to point a we'll have this exact same

281
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,400
thing now if you want to get to 2.0 B

282
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,890
you what you're going to do is you're

283
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,050
going to change out the arbitration feel

284
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,150
and make that one instead of a zero and

285
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:37,599
then that will actually extend the total

286
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,610
amount of data that you can total send

287
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,480
but you're going to then just after that

288
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:45,090
arbitration just after that remote the

289
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,020
attrition field you'll have another

290
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,390
section which would be another nineteen

291
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:55,480
bytes like it allow you to have

292
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:57,670
additional identification so when two

293
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,240
nodes on the network identify a

294
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:03,219
collision or they are as they're

295
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,170
processing through they need to

296
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:10,030
arbitrate who's gonna actually transmit

297
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:13,959
well they will listen for their own

298
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:16,150
transmission and then after they have

299
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,280
waited the allotment of time they will

300
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,709
go ahead and process based on their

301
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:25,449
message ID lower message IDs receive a

302
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:27,490
higher priority Oh db2 is lagoon lives

303
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,890
on the can bus and it's a part of the

304
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,110
unified diagnostic service that is

305
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,780
closed source and for has been

306
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:37,090
generating some open XE I am which is

307
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,890
another type of replacement for the

308
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,210
unified diagnostic service but I'm I

309
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:44,470
don't have enough information about that

310
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:47,380
Oh buddy two messages are again filled

311
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:54,210
out this you see it on the request seven

312
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:58,210
F sorry seven D F 0 to 0 1 the 70 F is

313
00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:00,730
the identifier along with the bytes and

314
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,740
length which is 0-2 and the mode that

315
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,190
you're requesting there's a series of

316
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,890
modes that are in oh do be two messages

317
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:11,590
when D G sees come up dice like

318
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:15,100
diagnostic trouble codes they are

319
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,750
appended with a P or B or C or au that

320
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,180
it stands for power train body chassis

321
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,800
or user the second digit determines

322
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,140
whether or not it's government-issued or

323
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,640
a manufactured issue and then the third

324
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,720
digit will determine the system that

325
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,100
it's actually involved in with

326
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,530
subsequent being the actual error

327
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,380
message so if you're getting started and

328
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,400
it's run a little bit long is I began

329
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:39,400
with using

330
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:42,430
an l2 329 R and torque it's basic

331
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,970
Android app available for free and

332
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:48,099
that's the elms 233 27 are pretty good

333
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,540
for just checking oh to be two messages

334
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,860
but I wanted to get into something a

335
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,530
little bit more and I wanted to actually

336
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,050
send canned messages so I actually

337
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:58,120
picked up a scan tool and obd2 link MX

338
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,829
plus didn't really offer me enough

339
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,710
control and I found the buffers were

340
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:07,590
overflowing so I went to a machine ax m2

341
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:11,140
open loop in comma AI pandas in order to

342
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:13,450
enumerate the can network I I'm aware

343
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,160
that there's kantack can do and can able

344
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,020
I'm not used any certificate I'm an

345
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,089
experienced those the software that

346
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,490
you're gonna use for that is at least I

347
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,650
used with savvy cam and putty with or

348
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,750
hyper terminal but if you're in Linux

349
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,920
environment sake can is a great option

350
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,910
along with cane utils and if you have

351
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,760
Wireshark on a Linux machine you can

352
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:36,219
actually address it cane messages that

353
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,630
way so when you're collecting data

354
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,180
you're gonna go to reduce the

355
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:43,480
signal-to-noise so what that meant for

356
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:45,099
me was I turn the car off and captured a

357
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,290
baseline signal when the system was

358
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,410
still initialized so just after turning

359
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:53,050
the car off waiting captured that

360
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,120
particular baseline and then went and

361
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:58,569
captured a unknown signal so five

362
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:03,220
presses of a key or pushing the pedal

363
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:05,200
down and back up with a no sequence from

364
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,940
there I take both data sets and I will

365
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,459
go ahead and eliminate the baseline from

366
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,810
the sample and basically rinse and

367
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,480
repeat do this multiple times in

368
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,950
iterative and then I've got a something

369
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,680
to really work with as far as analyzing

370
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,780
so ago I would then count the incidents

371
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,760
of messages from the filtered sample

372
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,490
data and then I look for timing between

373
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,859
the messages so I'm you know once if I

374
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:30,880
push the pedal five times and I only see

375
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:32,620
one action then obviously the the count

376
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,480
is not correct if I see one at the

377
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,070
beginning and one and three at the end

378
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,210
and I push it four times and it's

379
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,360
probably an issue because I should have

380
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,700
been coming up in even patterns and I'll

381
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,159
eliminate matching signals between so if

382
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,970
I've pushing a button on the steering

383
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,760
wheel

384
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:52,620
up down is probably going to be fairly

385
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:56,520
close in coming from the same module and

386
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:59,408
might be similar data so I can use those

387
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,480
when you're testing obviously there's

388
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:03,960
dragons there that's concerned because

389
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,100
you're now transmitting onto the bus and

390
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,750
you don't necessarily know whatever

391
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,789
messages you're sending out but

392
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,190
hopefully we'll littling that down using

393
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:14,740
some frequency analysis as a strong way

394
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:20,230
to be able to put yourself in a better

395
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:21,820
position I did have my car lock up where

396
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,400
I needed to power cycle it but a simple

397
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,270
power cycle fix that division testing is

398
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,620
another method for determining what

399
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,360
which messages are what and trying to

400
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,289
reverse-engineer those so you take the

401
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,260
full sample you send you retransmit the

402
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:42,429
first half and you see if you're the

403
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:45,190
impact on the system is viewed or not if

404
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:48,070
it was then you divide that first sample

405
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:51,039
up and of course three is fuzzing it's

406
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,080
not very productive effective because

407
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,299
there's a lot of data points that give

408
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,080
me happen in there and it becomes very

409
00:18:55,299 --> 00:19:00,370
difficult once you've got the message or

410
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,439
you've got an idea of the message and

411
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:06,270
you want to know more about what each

412
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,980
data bit stands for there's an open DB C

413
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:12,460
which is basically a lookup table

414
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,490
between how to convert the data sections

415
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:21,179
in the message to human readable

416
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:24,669
information so how many rpms and such

417
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:27,490
some suggestions on if you're looking to

418
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:29,740
try to do to do this is obviously look

419
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,169
for pattern recognitions and I recommend

420
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,059
Google search searching for a similar

421
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:36,070
issue similar makes and models and

422
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:39,220
brands is a strong way that you'll find

423
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,510
more information some ideas if you're

424
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,080
looking to get into yourself would be

425
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:46,150
you know preconditioning your car or

426
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,710
autopilot with comma AI home automation

427
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,380
so when your car gets home because it

428
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,510
has a GPS most likely that you can go

429
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,220
ahead and receive that make other

430
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,679
automations inside your home turn on or

431
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:59,290
whatnot nav controls if you're like mine

432
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,320
I have my phone set up so when

433
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,590
connect your audio jack instead of you

434
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,879
bluetooth I can still use the thumb pads

435
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,250
directional keys on the wheel in order

436
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,500
to control the phone additional

437
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,900
resources of the car hacking village is

438
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,590
a great opportunity building your own

439
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,940
bench lab is very informative car

440
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,850
hacker's handbook excellent book

441
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,220
available by no starch press and there

442
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:27,459
found out this today is actually there

443
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,570
is an application called IC sim along

444
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,890
with can utilities and you can actually

445
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:34,600
create a virtualized bus in order to

446
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,850
attempt to learn a little bit more and

447
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,919
experience yourself and with that I'll

448
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,919
finish thank you

449
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,990
