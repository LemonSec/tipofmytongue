1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,220
[Applause]

2
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:08,670
again I'm done alright adversarial

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,690
emulation no applause for that one

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,838
alright alright hello let's take a look

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,930
this is the last talk you will ever see

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,140
at Derby con first of all I'm sorry that

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,279
it's mine

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:30,240
so ending on a low note it's your fault

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:33,380
what was that don't stop talking or the

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:39,750
last forever we'll see how that goes

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:41,280
so how to serve Smee yeah come on

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,769
some of you are old enough to have seen

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,960
the twilight zone right there are no

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,000
experts in this space I'm not gonna

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,520
pretend to be one but I do get the

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,890
microphone so fundamentally this entire

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,410
talk is going to be discussing the fact

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,449
that I think that there is a different

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,370
approach to how we need to look at red

20
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,739
teaming part of this is going to be

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,170
concept I really like philosophy I think

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,200
all too often in this space we spend a

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,840
lot of time getting really technically

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,400
deep and we missed the point of did we

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,600
need to spend that much effort in that

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,320
direction what's the most common access

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:27,780
technique out in the world period

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:32,250
fishing click on an email why does it

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,990
work people click on the email write the

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,770
Nigerian prince is still a Nigerian

31
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:41,460
prince because it works I don't have to

32
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,390
be clever we don't have to be clever to

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:49,350
win statistics are in our favor

34
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:51,240
email is a system that I can send one

35
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,710
email I can send a million emails and

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,798
there's very little cost difference as

37
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,689
an attacker to do that so if I'm sending

38
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,299
a million emails and I just keep sending

39
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,719
a million emails I mean somebody's gonna

40
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:08,700
click on them right I was talking to a

41
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,709
see so last year and we're all trying to

42
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:14,640
get some sort of metrics they may seen a

43
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:18,640
metric on security that means anything

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,959
they don't exist why do you think we

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,690
have entire products that just give you

46
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:29,890
colors your security is polkadot yellow

47
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:32,020
whoa it's diseased and he was so excited

48
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,369
because he he was he'd implemented

49
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,660
fishing training so first of all he was

50
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,750
just excited he had a metric and he's

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,820
like we started we baselined 32% of

52
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,920
employees clicked on in emails fucking

53
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,239
morons

54
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,769
he didn't say that that's me that's more

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:50,590
my personality I apologize to the

56
00:02:44,770 --> 00:03:01,840
children didn't I almost throw up her a

57
00:02:50,590 --> 00:03:04,720
fuck it's even warmer is it because it

58
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,040
says ego on the slide in this community

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,060
we're a little too much driven by ego

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:14,459
Walter and then you get to throw it up

61
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,460
this is how you find out your insides I

62
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,720
did have to wrestle with my earlier

63
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:31,410
icing today where that was exactly what

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:31,410
was about to happen yes

65
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:37,599
[Laughter]

66
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,599
[Applause]

67
00:03:37,879 --> 00:04:16,259
if you're gonna do something you should

68
00:03:41,189 --> 00:04:19,039
go all-in or don't do it right I

69
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:23,780
actually don't know what this is yeah

70
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:23,780
this is this is a this is an alcohol

71
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:40,998
[Applause]

72
00:04:43,409 --> 00:05:18,249
you sacrifice for your craft tonight

73
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,998
can I can I emulate this part virtual

74
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:20,999
bryson drinks it

75
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:36,299
[Applause]

76
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:53,460
32% clicked on this fishing training

77
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,620
baseline and he's like then he was

78
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,700
really excited and then we've been doing

79
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,600
it we've been doing this training we do

80
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,010
in this training we've been doing this

81
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:08,070
training and finally Nate stopped

82
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:10,590
clicking on things we got down to 27

83
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:18,599
percent what up bitches

84
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:21,830
I'm like but still above zero only takes

85
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:31,260
one in right

86
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:34,260
27% times a million is what a number we

87
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,150
need to not be driven by winning we need

88
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,770
to not be driven by our egos we need to

89
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,719
not be driven by what seems sexy

90
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,620
technically what we need to be driven by

91
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,440
is what actually gets results what

92
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:52,500
matters if it doesn't matter why are you

93
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:54,660
doing it so pretty much we're gonna have

94
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,100
Walter running around to your job sites

95
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:01,800
and if you're not doing something you're

96
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:04,350
going to get Iced so i'm Bryson this is

97
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,580
me I've been doing this stuff for a long

98
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,260
time I founded Grimm I just launched

99
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,890
scythe and actually just kind of a cool

100
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,980
little story about that last Derby con

101
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,479
so we're one year old and Derby con was

102
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,440
our first conference as a vendor ever

103
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,090
and at Derby con with the handshake with

104
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,090
John strand at Black Hills was our first

105
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,679
customer so I mean we all we all like to

106
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,179
talk about the fun part to Derby con but

107
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,680
there's also a business side of this too

108
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,479
and so I always said we'll have a

109
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,830
special place because Derby con really

110
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:39,300
was our first customer and then I

111
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,979
co-founded the ICS villo

112
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,949
this is a nonprofit that does critical

113
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:46,620
infrastructure education awareness and

114
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:48,590
I'm the unicorn so you ever see a grown

115
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:57,840
man running around look like an idiot

116
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:59,310
that's me so some more quick background

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,060
on that I'm not gonna I'm not going to

118
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:05,340
show whatsoever I assure you just what

119
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,949
sent me on to to this talk was a few

120
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:12,409
years ago a large corporation who you

121
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:14,520
all know and shop at came to us because

122
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,840
they had pretty much run to the end of

123
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,020
the rainbow of being able to measure

124
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,580
their defense said okay like could you

125
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,039
build us a one-off implant like does

126
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,378
this thing and I was like wait hold on

127
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,000
so the amount of effort it's taken for

128
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,620
you to get through your bullshit

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,319
procurement process to come talk to me

130
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,760
you've done all of this research because

131
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,310
I'm gonna give boys and girls I'm gonna

132
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,990
give you some great life advice the best

133
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:40,439
ideas or what somebody else gives them

134
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:43,079
to you and they gave me one that's

135
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,910
that's what led to sight but and what

136
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:47,489
came out of that is I realized because

137
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,020
we see the problem with cybersecurity is

138
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,810
again the metrics we can't measure

139
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:54,230
anything we can measure things with time

140
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,550
but like how do you measure security

141
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,079
right that's why we do red teaming

142
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,640
that's why we do penetration testing we

143
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,609
are just trying to continue to find

144
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,740
little elements of the stuff but it's

145
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,870
snapshots in time where do we actually

146
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,709
get something that when I figure it out

147
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:13,170
today it's still true tomorrow and I

148
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:16,680
realized it's because when we're looking

149
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:19,469
at the entire scope of an attack that's

150
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,510
infinite there are an infinite number of

151
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,770
ways to gain access they don't have to

152
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,990
be technical again I don't think of a

153
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:28,079
phishing as a technical attack it's

154
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,880
social engineering or I put something on

155
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,609
a USB stick and you plug it in for me or

156
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,189
I break into your company and I just log

157
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,510
on or I pay somebody insider threat to

158
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,820
do it right there's an unlimited number

159
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:44,550
of ways to just show up but here's the

160
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,360
thing unless you're living in your

161
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,060
mother's basement

162
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,240
you don't just pop shell and drop my can

163
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,979
be like well that was cool

164
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,900
anybody do that

165
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,250
because I've gained access to your

166
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,720
system doesn't mean I've done anything

167
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,060
yet all I've done is open the door and

168
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,540
walked in it's what I do next

169
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,290
that entire chain actually is finite and

170
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,490
so this is where I came up with this

171
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,339
idea called the bounded attack

172
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,950
philosophy I first unveiled this at

173
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,630
shmoocon a couple of years ago and back

174
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,490
to metrics out of these several hundred

175
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,130
people who suffered through my

176
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,140
half-baked idea back then pretty much

177
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,540
only two people not told me not that I

178
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:28,620
should kill myself so that's a good

179
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:30,240
start still alive but it's contentious

180
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,530
to point out some of these things

181
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,600
because I think a lot of times we don't

182
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,310
want to question so what I came up with

183
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,350
this first of all why in cybersecurity

184
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,790
is this the only industry or discipline

185
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:51,450
that I know of and all of humankind

186
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:53,730
where we cry like little babies where

187
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,640
somebody else knows my things better

188
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,920
than I do why that doesn't seem right

189
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,840
and then I realized there's one space

190
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,670
that's not true about this because

191
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,120
attackers cannot defeat the laws of

192
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:09,990
physics

193
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:11,910
nobody can yet yet when I go on wires I

194
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,670
am one zeroes like everybody else that

195
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:17,630
is a 1 in zero I can't do anything about

196
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:20,849
that as an attacker I have to use

197
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,650
electrical impulses or optics right for

198
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,370
transmission layer one is always layer

199
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:29,160
one nobody can be clever at layer one

200
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:31,170
where I'm clever is where I try to hide

201
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:36,420
within the communication protocols from

202
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:38,130
layer two up but here's the thing I can

203
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,689
only talk in the protocols that you

204
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,300
already have in your environment right

205
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,160
the natural pattern of life the way that

206
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,709
your business everybody is already

207
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,630
speaking and doing those things I can't

208
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,720
be something else if I showed up with

209
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,130
some super secret squirrel protocol you

210
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,990
don't have to speak Russian - no I'm not

211
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:58,200
speaking English because that's what

212
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,950
everyone else is doing communication

213
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:05,240
protocols are a finite space I can't

214
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,240
the dowon's don't just come out

215
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:15,510
and the defender chooses what those are

216
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,840
I have to blend in with what you're

217
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,280
doing

218
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,160
I can't bring something else to the

219
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:24,839
table finite axis the next one is

220
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,680
behaviors attackers actually do the same

221
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,180
thing over and over and over and over

222
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,530
we're seeing interesting techniques but

223
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,930
at the end of the day the behaviors are

224
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:36,240
the same and there's a limited number of

225
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,770
behaviors you care about and so my

226
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,210
assertion which underpins all of this

227
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,710
and I'm still working on a lot of the

228
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,760
research because the behavioral side is

229
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,550
where we start going down some rabbit

230
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,500
holes is we can bounce the attack space

231
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,719
by you can only talk certain way and you

232
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,310
only do certain things and those are

233
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,230
both finite axes which gives me a

234
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,390
Cartesian plane that this is where you

235
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,860
will be you're not going to surprise me

236
00:12:54,390 --> 00:13:00,000
tomorrow because I know where you're

237
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:08,460
going to go I mean not me personally I

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,900
mean the stupid look isn't faked going

239
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:14,640
back to our earlier thing about the fish

240
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:25,550
and the access what is the largest risk

241
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:29,880
exposure in your environment the people

242
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:31,859
people how many solutions in this

243
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,120
industry actually address the people

244
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,560
side as I walk among the people I

245
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,040
remember meeting you last night you're

246
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:44,160
regretting that decision now aren't you

247
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,800
probably not many not many I don't know

248
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:52,110
any we are fond of creating nerd

249
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,280
solutions for nerd problems I you know

250
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,560
what if I ever do a stand-up routine

251
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,790
again I just want you there yeah keep

252
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:03,390
your shirt on but you know keep laughing

253
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:05,579
like that it's the people now do not

254
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,530
conflate the humor here of what the

255
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,990
average user looks like with the fact

256
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,069
that it is not the users fault users are

257
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,770
using computers the way they were

258
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,390
intended right it's not my fault I

259
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,920
clicked on an email there is nobody on

260
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,569
this planet that is sophisticated or

261
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,319
smart enough all of the times and never

262
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,250
get fooled by a

263
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,390
I'm sorry there can be that good you are

264
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,760
using the computer the way it is

265
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,130
intended that is the purpose so if you

266
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,020
are not looking at how people are using

267
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,970
computers in your environment from an

268
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,650
attack perspective you're missing most

269
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,650
of the understanding of what's your risk

270
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:47,459
all right oh I feel like that's actually

271
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:49,050
in the title all right 15 minutes all

272
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,180
right red team and penetration testing

273
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,560
just quickly the way I simplify it so we

274
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,290
don't get confused about semantics and

275
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,430
afterward you can say it was the Isis

276
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,760
fault that I came up with something this

277
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,500
stupid pen testing is looking at system

278
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,660
hardening where how do I technically

279
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,110
exploit something to gain access red

280
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,250
team is all of the post access well

281
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,040
correction doesn't have to be post

282
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,900
access but red teaming is going beyond I

283
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,360
just got on a box too I should

284
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,430
understand what is the enterprise risk

285
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:23,420
exposure and what is the contextual risk

286
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:27,229
to that so red teams today tend to be

287
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:31,290
exploitation focused we love our shells

288
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:33,150
crown jewels this is this is simplifying

289
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,490
things again I'm a simple person

290
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,840
but today's red team is mostly and

291
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,340
there's a lot of reasons why there are

292
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,020
constraints right we do not have

293
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,360
unlimited time we do not have unlimited

294
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:46,680
budget customers for some reason keep

295
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,910
complaining about money I would I would

296
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,939
love to have a customer just coming to

297
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:53,280
me and be like write a number and do

298
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:58,890
that red team and I'll be like ten

299
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:03,300
million dollars every year and then I

300
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:09,120
don't have to give talks ever again but

301
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:10,469
so the today's rate what's that atlas

302
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,610
I'm glad that has your name on your

303
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:18,920
shirt is that in case you get lost it's

304
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,920
because I'm speaking but I can't read

305
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,839
okay so today's red team simplistically

306
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,490
is all too often is a very surgical

307
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,660
perspective for a lot of the reasons

308
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:31,040
that there are constraints on it which

309
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:34,819
is I get in one to one boom own domain

310
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,319
drop Mike peace out it works for a

311
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,820
certain degree except for a lot of

312
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,680
enterprises are having fatigue about

313
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,520
that they're like they want again of

314
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,699
course

315
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,470
what did I learn stuff

316
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,820
guess what how much of that stuff I'm

317
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,760
actually gonna fix the next time the red

318
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,230
teamers come back all of you who do pen

319
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,670
testing a red teaming how often do you

320
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,200
see the same things with those clients

321
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,550
over and over again raise your hands if

322
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,230
you see it all the time every single

323
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,790
time it's like why did you even pay me

324
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,930
to do the test I could have just taken

325
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:04,938
the report from last year we're all

326
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:09,230
trapped in the cycle where we are going

327
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:11,240
down together and a lot of that again is

328
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,329
that's not how a real-world adversary

329
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,620
works this is one of the things that we

330
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,389
need to understand what we also look at

331
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:20,300
things like capture the flag understand

332
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,800
the capture the flag is a game it is a

333
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,480
game that has walls that those walls

334
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
should be as hard to see as possible but

335
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,199
those walls are really finite because

336
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,750
again we don't allow a capture the flag

337
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,280
to last over three years for example do

338
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,040
we know adversaries that have that kind

339
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,629
of time frame do we know adversaries

340
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:40,220
that say like think of things in terms

341
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:41,630
of millennia as an entire culture huh so

342
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,640
what do you think they're doing when

343
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,630
they're actually doing attacks do you

344
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,040
think they're following that same

345
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:54,140
cultural understanding exactly little

346
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:56,590
baby internal red team's right repeated

347
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,910
engagements a lot of a red team's

348
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,919
administrative overhead is when Dead Set

349
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,450
cops or DevOps or the blue team or the

350
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,130
sock is like hey we're pushing out this

351
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,570
thing could you validate it before we go

352
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,770
out I mean it's not even like really red

353
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,120
teaming but that's an administrative

354
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:11,150
requirement that happens when you're

355
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,860
internally in an organization and then

356
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,350
external red team's we love them because

357
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,209
there's this unique other perspective

358
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,459
one of the things I always try to push

359
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,140
with clients here is a lot of clients

360
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,460
really like the black box perspective

361
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,630
right you're gonna start from nothing

362
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,370
because I want to know everything that

363
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,410
you can do only you know with this like

364
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,199
limited timeframe and budget and you

365
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,360
know so that'll be a real adversarial

366
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,190
equivalent when you think about how many

367
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,199
tens of thousands to millions of dollars

368
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,429
to assets throughout the entire world an

369
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,870
amount of research they're doing when

370
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,600
they be four they even actually conduct

371
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:45,379
the test compared to a consulting

372
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,449
company huh maybe it's easier just to

373
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,150
like let's do white box where we move it

374
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,530
down so we can focus more on

375
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,940
understanding what's actually happening

376
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:58,160
on your enterprise as opposed to just

377
00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:00,380
what's your posture and the other final

378
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,780
piece is when you're doing an assessment

379
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,030
it's a snapshot we go back to the

380
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,649
ability to measure things understand a

381
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,178
limited engagement that's like two weeks

382
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,970
or four weeks or whatever whatever that

383
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,660
is that's a snapshot in time how many

384
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,169
variables

385
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,970
influence that result right Suzy not

386
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:18,800
coming into work turned out to be a bad

387
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,850
thing whereas Bobby did and everything

388
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,159
got screwed up during that assessment

389
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,959
the standard deviation of what did we

390
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:38,210
actually learn is a question mark

391
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:40,309
we don't know all right add vary that

392
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,840
was on purpose because I wanted to show

393
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:46,010
how the Russians were fucking with me in

394
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,570
real time so what do we want we'll be

395
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,000
doing adversarial emulation first of all

396
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,980
we want something that was customizable

397
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,809
it needs to change based on what we're

398
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,610
trying to demonstrate the purpose of

399
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:57,050
adversarial emulation is understanding

400
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,300
the contours what's really going on in

401
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:03,710
that defensive environment particularly

402
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:06,678
if you spell it correctly repeatable we

403
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,790
want to be able to share this kill say

404
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,100
an insight when I'm talking about those

405
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,780
contours it's not that I win but it's

406
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,610
that I understand where the choke points

407
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,500
and where those apertures very wide and

408
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,770
where they're very narrow and you can do

409
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,690
simple tricks to move beyond those if

410
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,940
you think again what an adversary can do

411
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,440
adversaries can steal certs and sign

412
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,500
their own software making that look

413
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,000
legitimate does anybody in this room do

414
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,860
that

415
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,950
the FBI is right back there

416
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:36,289
no we don't that's illegal that's the

417
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,460
nation state level capability and so if

418
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:39,500
we're going to emulate something like

419
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,090
that then maybe we should just like sign

420
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,700
the software and whitelist it to be able

421
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,279
to then move past that choke point

422
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:48,710
emulating that behavior so just a quick

423
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:51,830
question I'm going to start with a poll

424
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,179
and then what we'll interrogate um does

425
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,408
anybody think that it matters that

426
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:56,600
there's a difference semantically

427
00:20:54,409 --> 00:21:00,980
between emulation and simulation raise

428
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:19,428
your hand if you think yes okay Caitie

429
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:20,230
nickles from mitre yes I am actually

430
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:24,799
coming back here

431
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,370
so why simulation implies it's an exact

432
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,918
match

433
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:30,049
emulation sort of in the spirit of but

434
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,669
we can never match adversaries exactly

435
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:34,680
so I prefer I mean they should rather

436
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:41,390
than simulation I love that

437
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:41,390
[Applause]

438
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:47,539
do we have an unlimited supply of people

439
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,299
that actually know what they're doing in

440
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:52,299
the space I'm clear proof ooh don't you

441
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,389
ever own again this is what the bottom

442
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,210
looks like so feel good about yourselves

443
00:21:56,389 --> 00:22:00,500
right again I apologized at the

444
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,899
beginning that this was your last Derby

445
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:07,519
con talk but your self-esteem will be so

446
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:09,229
much higher as you leave we have a

447
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,360
people problem we don't just have a

448
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:15,139
people problem on the user side we have

449
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,029
a people problem on our expert side we

450
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:19,010
need to find a way to quickly be able to

451
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:23,120
bring juniors up and be able to get them

452
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:25,610
going faster all right white box first

453
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,908
black box we talked about that defense

454
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:31,120
validation Katie actually just gave this

455
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:31,120
slide

456
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,789
Wow she's amazing

457
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,080
really is like if you guys don't follow

458
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:41,309
like the coins on Twitter you're a moron

459
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,629
she really is one of the one of the best

460
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:47,668
in the brightest I'm actually not that

461
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:50,630
like I love you what was that drive to

462
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:58,470
come back yeah I know I was just

463
00:22:50,630 --> 00:23:03,030
harassing her okay um who here uses an

464
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:05,730
MSP in their organization how good are

465
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:08,158
they they're not good how do you know

466
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:13,830
they're not good you I'm gonna skip over

467
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:17,460
there what's that

468
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:19,908
they have great metrics wait hold on is

469
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:25,770
that them self reporting on themselves

470
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:28,280
yeah huh I've also heard of one MSSP and

471
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:31,500
I won't name names I think they're here

472
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:35,210
who they charged by the number of

473
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,210
tickets that they opened on themselves

474
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,780
like we're not even back into security

475
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:41,960
now we're just looking at business

476
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:48,059
practices and that's a brilliant one I

477
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:51,000
mean it is if the customers pay us we

478
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,559
want to be able to understand so in

479
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,110
terms of metrics I think what we have

480
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,700
today there's only three metrics that I

481
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,799
think we can definitively say matter and

482
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,659
they tie back to the time how quickly

483
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,490
with it this is the purpose of

484
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,559
adversarial emulation is how quickly

485
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,940
because it's about resilience right

486
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,200
we're in that phase of cyber security

487
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,880
where resilience is the thing that we

488
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,350
said is most important and the ability

489
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,320
to measure that is a question of time of

490
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:17,100
how quickly can identify anomalous how

491
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:20,010
quickly can I respond how quickly can I

492
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,330
remediate and then there's some sub

493
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,419
metrics inside of that where you might

494
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:27,500
have something it's like well when did

495
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:29,220
our tools see it versus when did a human

496
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,260
understand that that was something worth

497
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:39,740
interrogating and then how long did that

498
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:41,929
take mitre attack

499
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,429
so sitting next to Katie Nichols is

500
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:47,870
another fantastic individual from

501
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:51,220
lighter named Adam Pennington they're

502
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,219
never coming to any of my talks again

503
00:24:52,510 --> 00:25:00,500
who knows the Pyramid of pain you do now

504
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:02,090
right credit to David Bianco so this I

505
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,770
think is a great way of looking at it

506
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,059
and going back to again Katie really

507
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,740
should be getting this talk apparently

508
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:09,918
because she summed it up so nicely here

509
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,020
is emulation versus emulation is really

510
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,340
a question of scale and how much effort

511
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,820
we want to push into these things of

512
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,199
exact versus approximate the biggest

513
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,668
flaw that I see in the way that the

514
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,419
industry has responded to mitre attack

515
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:26,179
because it's very comprehensive it's in

516
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:27,830
a nice little like check box look so we

517
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:30,260
just start to look at it like check

518
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,529
boxes if you're using it like check

519
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:35,840
boxes you're not going to get anywhere

520
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:37,190
because focusing on those particular

521
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,889
technical implementations there are a

522
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:43,070
number of ways to do those emulation

523
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:47,299
versus emulation behavior versus

524
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:50,779
signature so threat intelligence today I

525
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:52,940
would suggest is mostly I will tell you

526
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:55,010
statically what I learned yesterday and

527
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,809
by the time I tell you fundamentally

528
00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:00,350
it's already out of date because I can

529
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:07,580
give you signatures does malware ever

530
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:09,110
change its signature on the fly it can I

531
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,750
can also tell you what domains are bad

532
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:13,189
does malware ever change its domains

533
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:22,399
that it's going through its c2 on the

534
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:24,200
fly or IP addresses right and then we

535
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,668
get the detailed analyst report because

536
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,440
at the end of the day this is what's

537
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:30,950
informing our adversarial understanding

538
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:35,510
be able to emulate it who reads the 40

539
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:38,690
to 60 page reports and how easy is

540
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:45,290
to take that report and action it he's

541
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:46,250
shaking is that no sigh we need

542
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,320
something better

543
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:51,110
we need something where it is easier for

544
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,879
us to take this information in a format

545
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,290
for us to be able to do the adversarial

546
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,790
emulation this is where I'm pointing out

547
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:58,040
what I'm talking about and what we will

548
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:59,570
continue to go through here has a gap

549
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,399
where the industry is not giving us the

550
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,439
information we need in a way to be able

551
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,390
to do this easily otherwise we're back

552
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,740
to the expert problem of we can stand up

553
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,060
on stage all day and give you opinions

554
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,720
but you know what they say about

555
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:16,399
opinions I figured out let's see with

556
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,420
like jump in on that good call and then

557
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,220
the final piece for being able to

558
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,240
adversarial emulation is to take actual

559
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,520
adversarial malware and try to neuter it

560
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,900
which is a complex process of course of

561
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,129
reverse engineering to understand

562
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,010
exactly all of the things that it's

563
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,420
doing and then trying to be comfortable

564
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:37,730
to safely employ that back into your own

565
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:41,030
environment who's done that um you have

566
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:42,500
I couldn't your hand like brief like oh

567
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:46,610
oh I even thought it was a guide in

568
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,750
front of you hand was so brief see I'm

569
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,010
not going for dramatic effect I'm

570
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,070
actually trying to be functional so I'm

571
00:27:49,010 --> 00:28:00,890
running tell me about that it's very

572
00:27:52,070 --> 00:28:05,060
difficult mmm what's your name by the

573
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:09,860
way what Mike generic white guy name

574
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:14,629
cool now I don't even know why you're

575
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:17,379
videoing I'm never up there I'm totally

576
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:20,540
fueled by spear and off whoo

577
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,450
miter attack more detail miter attack

578
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:26,409
lots of things new favorite miter attack

579
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,410
sub techniques

580
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:31,500
credit to mr. attack himself Blake Strom

581
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,630
there they really are doing some amazing

582
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:39,129
work I think it's it's more the fault of

583
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,920
us that we have yet to figure out how to

584
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:44,200
take this and do something more with it

585
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,490
the way I like to think about it is this

586
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,730
is a periodic table

587
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:51,760
it describes elements just like we do in

588
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:53,050
chemistry and an attack is a combination

589
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,080
of multiple of those elements to

590
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:57,430
describe a full attack for any of you

591
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,750
who have a criticism of the attack

592
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,550
framework first of all they are

593
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:03,000
incredibly receptive they are still

594
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:05,110
sitting here after Ivan being an asshole

595
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,490
there are wonderful patient people but

596
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,770
they know really honestly if not I don't

597
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,540
work for my turf so we're clear but they

598
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,760
really are open and they have done a lot

599
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,620
in terms of pushing this the thing to

600
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,350
understand is whatever your criticisms

601
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,750
are this is now a way for us all to talk

602
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:22,990
easily to discuss what's happening right

603
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,120
we now have a common vernacular that's

604
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,980
like step one after like admission that

605
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,709
you're a drunk you have a way to be able

606
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:35,050
to talk about it step two we have more

607
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:37,720
steps to go so the good and the bad

608
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,340
we just talked about this it's a way of

609
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,790
focusing on things behaviorally and

610
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:44,409
being able to discuss those and over

611
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,490
time going back to that standard

612
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,400
deviation question when we take

613
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,410
snapshots it's a great way to visualize

614
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,130
effectiveness and understanding as long

615
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,090
as we are not focusing it as a checkbox

616
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,490
this is a lot of where we see the the

617
00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:03,220
abuse right the abuse is the use of it

618
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:06,610
not the framework itself so some open

619
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:09,400
source options also made by mitre so I'm

620
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:15,969
gonna show two different open source

621
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:17,680
options and you will see how how well

622
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,450
they works trying to do certain

623
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,990
different pieces for emulating

624
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:25,420
particular adversaries had some

625
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:28,630
challenge some of these things didn't

626
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:30,670
work back both of them had problems so

627
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,110
don't take this anything more than a

628
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,880
nominal perspective and I will share my

629
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,620
slides so a lot of the detail of what

630
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,110
you'll be seeing on those are more just

631
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,418
like a snapshot of understanding by the

632
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,279
end of this year

633
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:45,299
you will push out a report that looks at

634
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:48,609
all of the 20s I think is 23 different

635
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:51,759
see to emulation options with the

636
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:56,649
high-level pros and cons and guide so

637
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:59,769
this is just two of them I promise I was

638
00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:02,018
sober when I put this together all right

639
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:04,539
so caldera first of all is attack from

640
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:07,450
day one it is built-in it is integrated

641
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:09,419
it is like here is a way to take attack

642
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,129
and bring it with adversarial behavior

643
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:13,779
into your environment and it's open

644
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:16,059
source and actively developed I think

645
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:20,440
what version two just came out like this

646
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:23,980
past summer yes okay the con part of it

647
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:27,850
is its agent based the challenge with

648
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:30,460
agents so caldera I feel works really

649
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:32,080
well when you're trying to test like a

650
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,090
golden image it works really well in a

651
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,918
lab it's not something you can easily

652
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,480
move into a production environment and a

653
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,369
lot of that is because of the kind of

654
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,789
resource utilization that is required on

655
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:46,379
that actual end point we'll just note

656
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:49,259
there's some bugs and I'll show them and

657
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:55,389
customization was also a challenge

658
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:57,039
caldera so I said I'll share these

659
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:59,350
slides so you can walk through all this

660
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,200
a little bit more detail but first we're

661
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:05,259
going to try to build a custom adversary

662
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,749
and we're going to struggle with that

663
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:11,049
so we tried doing that we use PowerShell

664
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:14,580
to inject the agent and we just sort of

665
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:14,580
get an unknown error of it doesn't work

666
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:24,070
actually what you know I'll pause here I

667
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:26,259
did literally try to conclude to show

668
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,609
that like this is like the real world

669
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:28,989
perspective not just that we're

670
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:30,699
emulating real world but also the

671
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:32,799
challenges of working with a lot of

672
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,059
these tools do you want me to cut

673
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,009
through that or do you want to see

674
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:38,499
literally me struggling with trying to

675
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:40,919
get some of these things to work you

676
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,919
want to see me struggle

677
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:55,370
hmm okay so I'm gonna hide behind here

678
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:01,260
okay so they have this really convenient

679
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,150
thing like I said that with the miter

680
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,390
attack framework being integrated into

681
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,260
it that I can pull up adversaries in

682
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,580
this case we're pulling up something

683
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,660
called hunter you can see all the

684
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:20,580
different phases with the different

685
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:23,310
pieces works on Windows yeah okay so

686
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,659
we're trying to build a custom piece

687
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,220
like said what's really nice about this

688
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,540
if you notice on these filters here

689
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,360
where you're building up the payload is

690
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:32,159
it's right back into here's the

691
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,780
different column in that column here's

692
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,160
all the techniques here the sub

693
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:37,110
techniques available to that click click

694
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,730
click and it's I mean it's right there

695
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:42,199
you can see the contextual code right

696
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,200
next to it describing what's happening

697
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:58,530
so we're building up across the

698
00:33:49,770 --> 00:34:00,270
different phases here was the bug

699
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:01,620
alright so please enter an adversary

700
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:04,530
description of this custom adversary we

701
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,929
just built did I just enter a name as it

702
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:09,300
prompts me yes I did

703
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:12,090
computer I did I just sent her name like

704
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,260
it told me to and the pop-up that keeps

705
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,870
popping up there is you have not entered

706
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,850
a name

707
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:28,259
you can't enter a code up there that's

708
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:29,880
the only place to do this kept typing so

709
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,610
we were unable to build a custom

710
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:35,640
adversary for some sort of strange input

711
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:38,310
error I I don't know why do you do you

712
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:40,859
guys know no I don't know it was really

713
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,529
frustrating so we went with a pre-baked

714
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,720
adversary instead of trying to build up

715
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:48,300
build up one if you're not aware they've

716
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,699
also been doing periodic evaluations

717
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,610
where they take participating EDRs and

718
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:54,719
they are at they're emulating particular

719
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,339
adversaries

720
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:01,109
through a combination of cobalt strike

721
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:02,520
and caldera so for a starting example

722
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:05,609
that's out there published by The MITRE

723
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,069
there is apt 3 that they did and I think

724
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:11,430
that published in January so here is all

725
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:14,038
the code of a pre-baked adversary that

726
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:16,288
it spit out from us pushing this

727
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:18,539
different things now we're gonna run

728
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:21,059
this on the endpoints we're gonna

729
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:22,410
install the agent and go one of the

730
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:24,480
things that was a little freshening here

731
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:26,970
is that a couple of the functions for

732
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,500
what the adversary did failed and there

733
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:32,430
was no error message for why those

734
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:34,079
failed so that was a little rough the

735
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,700
other thing is that the code also

736
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,940
removed all the back slashes for all

737
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:41,279
directories turns out computers like

738
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,020
that but they don't like it when you

739
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,829
remove them so I don't I don't know why

740
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:49,200
that happened is this good enough

741
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:52,470
struggling for you Jeff ok because it's

742
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,609
it's feeling very warm up here like he's

743
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,558
supposed to show us adversarial

744
00:35:53,609 --> 00:36:04,380
emulation and he's really doing a

745
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:09,569
semi-decent job see I don't I don't know

746
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:11,190
why this is all so the challenge with

747
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:12,720
with giving these talks is you end up

748
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,839
only being able to show up at 2:00 p.m.

749
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,578
with what you've fully completed not all

750
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,869
of the things so like I said I do

751
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:20,190
promise by the end of the year we'll be

752
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:25,829
pushing something out looking at a lot

753
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:27,089
of this in more detail next up next up

754
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:33,059
all right there you go PowerShell an

755
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:34,920
empire it's dying the Python that is

756
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:36,809
based on has been deprecated and it is

757
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,660
no longer under active support which is

758
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:41,190
a challenge

759
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:44,129
PowerShell why do we love PowerShell

760
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:47,010
from a red team perspective it's

761
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,900
built-in you just gave me the tools and

762
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,940
I ran with it from a defensive

763
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:56,150
perspective what's what's the immediate

764
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:59,220
solution to catching that what's that

765
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:01,039
all I have to do is see when you call in

766
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,078
to my essentially managed instance right

767
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,299
all I have to do is awed it when you

768
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,470
tell me you're here like that's

769
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:09,270
literally it

770
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,830
all I have to do is when you call to use

771
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,210
me just notice that you're not supposed

772
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,700
to call to use me because the attacker

773
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,290
has to come up and do this

774
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,149
going back to emulation versus emulation

775
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,700
so this is something that's very popular

776
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,770
with the living off the land perspective

777
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,770
from a red team view because why would I

778
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:27,870
bring my own tools to the table but in

779
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:30,509
terms of the threat landscape we don't

780
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:34,109
actually see that much power shell being

781
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:37,020
used because it's really easy to catch

782
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:39,000
but from a defensive perspective moving

783
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,160
past that hey I am auditing for your

784
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,980
unauthorized invocation of PowerShell in

785
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,569
my environment because that's a flag we

786
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,040
need to be looking at the behaviors of

787
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,630
what happens if PowerShell is still

788
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,270
being used in my environment which is

789
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,320
one of the things that Empire helps do

790
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:55,259
so that I can be focusing on that

791
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,790
PowerShell functionality of what it's

792
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,700
doing in my environment as it iterates

793
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:02,060
through the stages to its ultimate

794
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,060
mission

795
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,620
all right so Empire okay we're in

796
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,520
so using listeners opening meterpreter

797
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:22,169
we were having some issues with

798
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:35,910
meterpreter opening up with an empire

799
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:43,890
here so we're going to use a dot bat to

800
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:51,109
launch it I said I was sober when I was

801
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:51,109
typing and this was our meterpreter fail

802
00:38:51,260 --> 00:39:01,470
so moving beyond that all right so we're

803
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:09,560
going in and we are going to try again

804
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:14,520
by doing a DLL inject and here we go

805
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:17,270
back slashes all right

806
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,270
listeners active

807
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:26,538
what what are you laughing at that I

808
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:34,309
that I typed help do I look like I need

809
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:35,599
help ya know the intent with that so

810
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:37,130
that you could see all the commands that

811
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,660
were available at any particular stage

812
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,220
so as like I said when I share the

813
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,920
slides afterward because this goes by

814
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,118
really quickly for for time purposes you

815
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:49,760
can see a lot more of what was actually

816
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:53,690
happening in detail alright so we're

817
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,819
back in Windows with an agent we're

818
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:58,369
going to use HTTP I think that there was

819
00:39:55,819 --> 00:40:01,730
a problem with one of the protocols

820
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:09,589
before and we're now in with HTTP as our

821
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:12,890
c2 egress that is a ton of functionality

822
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:19,759
right there right half of that is

823
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:21,890
PowerShell half that is custom Python so

824
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,299
this was this is the real power of this

825
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,509
is when we're looking at particularly

826
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:29,089
the very specific elements of any sub

827
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,339
technique that I want to do Empire is a

828
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:34,400
phenomenal option to go to that level of

829
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:40,250
granularity if we have the guidance on

830
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:42,529
what we're emulating to do that which in

831
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,539
the purpose of time I'm sorry I'm gonna

832
00:40:42,529 --> 00:40:47,029
cut this part short okay living off the

833
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:52,069
land we were talking about that so there

834
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:53,329
is a repository called low pass so

835
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:55,700
living off the lands binaries and

836
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:58,670
scripts the challenge with it is it's

837
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:00,828
windows-only again a lot of these things

838
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,210
come back to what we make use of in them

839
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:03,529
and so one of the flaws we see out there

840
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,480
is it's tempting to focus on the

841
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:11,539
signature versus the technique of what

842
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:13,609
is teaching us alright so in terms of

843
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:15,500
what we want to emulate again I go back

844
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:17,509
to the original premise here of what

845
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,760
kind of behaviors are we looking at the

846
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:21,890
first one which has particularly struck

847
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,160
city governments municipalities

848
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:28,670
throughout the United States is

849
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,440
ransomware and that's because all of

850
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,970
these city governments are effectively

851
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,410
below the cybersecurity poverty line

852
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,810
they may heard that phrase before

853
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:38,020
courtesy of Wendy neither also one of

854
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:40,220
the smartest people ever

855
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,590
there are haves and have-nots in this

856
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,419
space and unfortunately all of us the

857
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:46,780
citizens are being served by local

858
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,660
government that are have-nots and

859
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:52,100
ransomware is creating this destruction

860
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,080
ransomware does it in two ways first of

861
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,060
all intentionally where I'm doing that

862
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,230
because I want to make money through

863
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:02,450
cryptocurrency the second is as a decoy

864
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:04,400
because ransomware could be another way

865
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,600
to cause destruction and environment

866
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,930
that makes it look like I'm doing

867
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,910
something else

868
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,870
escalation escalation can be done

869
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,700
through a combination of social

870
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,160
engineering if you give me my password

871
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,620
then we're good there all the way to I

872
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,049
can use technical methods for being able

873
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,310
to use proof of concepts which is the

874
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,230
same way of looking at controls

875
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,660
validation or configuration checking for

876
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:28,670
something that's out there if it's

877
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,310
patched I know that that doesn't work if

878
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,990
it isn't I know it does anyone see the

879
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:36,020
study that came out on the effectiveness

880
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:38,020
of patches came out like two months ago

881
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,310
you did

882
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:43,790
it's Fernando right yeah I remember

883
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:46,870
meeting you in Austin and January you

884
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:49,550
mean the one from Kenna and Phi India on

885
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:53,920
vulnerability of scoring okay yeah it's

886
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:53,920
a it's not just C D F F 10th

887
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:58,910
turns out patching also introduces

888
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:03,110
errors who knew that software developers

889
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:06,529
screw things up patching is not the

890
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:09,080
panacea but knowing particular thing can

891
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:11,720
exist at a particular point again going

892
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,549
back to the CBS s scores again this is a

893
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,830
concept that's been abused because

894
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:22,430
something is a CBS s 10 does that mean I

895
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:31,069
care maybe who said maybe I was just

896
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:32,629
over there maybe right context most user

897
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,640
computers do not have direct internet

898
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,770
access most servers do not have direct

899
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,569
internet access that was the thing that

900
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:40,430
was so interesting about a particular

901
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,740
Bank that has been in the news in the

902
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:44,779
last few months was the fact that it was

903
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:47,229
one step for all of that that was the

904
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,230
shocking part

905
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,870
and I think that the insider threat she

906
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,390
did that at like 30 different companies

907
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:55,160
when is that like the number can you

908
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,509
imagine one person compromised like 30

909
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:01,420
different companies at that scale and

910
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:01,420
then talked about it on social media

911
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:08,690
persistence so everyone knows our

912
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,370
persistence is right like this is my

913
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,110
ability to survive everything from as

914
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:15,230
simple as you've turned your computer

915
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:21,760
off all the way to you've completely

916
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:24,410
rebuilt an image and I'm still there and

917
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,250
then of course our favorite which is

918
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,779
credentials

919
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,730
everyone knows something like mini cats

920
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,170
right there are a ton of ways from past

921
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:32,120
the hash to different ways to stealing

922
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,250
different kinds of credentials by golly

923
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,359
right running out time here networking

924
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,460
activities what's going on in the

925
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,410
network so that's again where I argue

926
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,810
that that's a finite space you have to

927
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:43,640
talk through that space there are of

928
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:46,490
course out-of-band options there are a

929
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,690
lot of other ways that a threat can get

930
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,330
something out of the environment but

931
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:52,130
when we're talking about 99.99% of

932
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:55,790
attacks we're just going back through

933
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:57,140
your wires and I'll just repeat it out

934
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:59,810
loud because the cloud is your friend

935
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,700
and your enemy there was a really cool

936
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:03,410
IOT talk yesterday and I can't remember

937
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,089
the gentleman's name where he talked

938
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:08,210
about a whole cloud infrastructure for

939
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:09,860
IOT compromise we're checking out if

940
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,380
that's enough detail to do it with since

941
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,600
I don't know his name

942
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:16,100
lateral movement lateral movement is key

943
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,930
because lateral movement is how we're

944
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,000
establishing contextual business risk so

945
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:22,210
understanding this is gonna surprise

946
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,400
everyone attackers are not omniscient

947
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:27,520
most attacks it's like alright I first

948
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:31,070
get a call back in the real world I'm

949
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,690
somewhere I know kind of who I'm with

950
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:34,400
because I've been targeting them but I

951
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:36,170
don't know where I am there and more

952
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,490
importantly I don't not only do I know

953
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:40,130
where I am I don't know where I want to

954
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:42,560
go and so it's a question of time and

955
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,710
persistence from what am I going to be

956
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,810
doing for me to get where I want to go

957
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:50,060
how long how do I do that lateral

958
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:51,799
movement is the biggest piece to do that

959
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:55,279
again it goes back to access isn't the

960
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,370
question that initial compromise is most

961
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,960
likely not where I wanted to go if you

962
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,950
were to pick one target in any

963
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,440
organization

964
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:09,740
to go after a person wise function who

965
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:11,630
would it be the front desk sales pelas

966
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:17,330
done the objective Fernando stop it's

967
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:18,860
hard what help desk okay but help desk

968
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:20,090
or theoretically technically smart

969
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,150
people there that's gonna be a harder

970
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:25,190
target I would argue recruiting

971
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:27,020
recruiting is the one function that is

972
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,580
required to interact with strangers all

973
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:33,320
the time and open everything they send

974
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:34,910
them that would be my primary target but

975
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:39,140
recruiting doesn't give me anything of

976
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:40,339
interest itself but it got me in then we

977
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:43,940
start laterally moving to Weber of

978
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:47,210
interest toward a purple team purples

979
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:49,360
great yay purple unicorns insert and

980
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,360

[Music]

983
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:13,520
and inserting slide like we're done

984
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:16,520
