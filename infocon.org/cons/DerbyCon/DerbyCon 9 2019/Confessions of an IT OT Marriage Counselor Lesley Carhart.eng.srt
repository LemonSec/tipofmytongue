1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
so some of you actually know the word

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,290
that's in the title that's talked that I

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,350
have 20 minutes to teach you about

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:11,190
that's awesome so hi guys my name is

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,290
Leslie and hi

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,420
and I work for a company called Drago's

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,810
and I'm also known as hacks for pancakes

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,220
and my company does industrial control

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,680
system our critical infrastructure

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,299
security and my job there is digital

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,400
forensics and Incident Response on

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,160
critical infrastructure industrial

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,519
systems like power water oil and gas

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,500
manufacturing transportation like air

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,420
travel train stuff like that so stuff

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,000
that goes mostly stuff that does stuff

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,829
I've been an input stock for about 12

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
years now and something I'm not

19
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,989
admitting to an IT and I do some other

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,789
stuff but basically when a power plant

21
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,440
gets hacked on the person one of the few

22
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,199
people in the world who get called out

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,480
to figure out what happened to me

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:57,089
so have you ever been raise your hand if

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,788
you ever get tired of all this new crap

26
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,609
in InfoSec like blockchain next gen

27
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,280
cloud you're all sick of it right okay

28
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,210
so I've got great news for all of you

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,939
great news everyone

30
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,309
you too can go back in time and escape

31
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,949
all this stuff you can explore such

32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,259
exciting topics as Windows NT that can't

33
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,820
be upgraded proprietary and obsolete

34
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,460
industrial products with no

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,389
documentation XP and Betty computers

36
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,798
with a mandatory 20 year life cycle and

37
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,720
extreme environments with safety

38
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,460
concerns like very cold very hot

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,590
explodes good things like that

40
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,689
corrosive all for the low low price of

41
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,860
all the modern threats that we have to

42
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,960
deal with today and IT security

43
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,730
following you there like the Terminator

44
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,860
so let's start with some basic

45
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:43,630
terminology in industrial control

46
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:47,110
systems so the first one I'm going to

47
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:49,390
talk about a lot is processes so when I

48
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,850
talk about a process I'm talking about a

49
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:55,000
thing that happens kinetically in an

50
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:58,030
environment your process could be making

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,330
tans cans of tuna it could be making

52
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:04,030
20-sided dies it could be pumping gas

53
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:06,580
out of the gas the pump at the gas

54
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,990
station into your car there's all kinds

55
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,050
of processes it's around us in our daily

56
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:14,260
lives they can be there are usually

57
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,600
digital physical things so things that a

58
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,220
electronic system impacts but there's

59
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,590
lots of mechanical processes out there

60
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,570
too before we had digital devices we had

61
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,940
cans of tuna made by something some kind

62
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,130
of machine so processes are things like

63
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,520
assembly lines they're things that make

64
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,959
a kinetic thing happen ot when I talk

65
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,310
about ot and I throw that word around a

66
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,890
lot I'm talking about operational

67
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:37,840
technology that's a common term for an

68
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,549
environment where a process happens so

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,959
the OT environment is your Factory it's

70
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,800
your power plant it's your water

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,209
treatment plant

72
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,920
it's these environments where these

73
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,530
scary interesting awesome things happen

74
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,850
that we're going to talk about today

75
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,980
industrial control systems are the

76
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,109
systems which control those processes

77
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,030
they make them happen they make sure

78
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,130
that the right amount of tuna gets in

79
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,540
the can they make sure the cans go the

80
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,950
right speed down to convey I don't know

81
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,480
why I'm a tuna thing I think I'm hungry

82
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,410
but anyway we're going to talk about

83
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,320
tuna so we're going to talk about that

84
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,450
now a lot of people eat interchange ICS

85
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,700
and SCADA they are not interchangeable

86
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,950
terms and I don't have to time to go

87
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,380
into a huge description of why they are

88
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,359
not interchangeable terms today but

89
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,790
industrial control systems can be non

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,280
digital things they can be just a

91
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,810
mechanical wheel some steampunk gear as

92
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,220
it turned that make the tuna come out

93
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,530
and go into the can of the conveyor belt

94
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,480
go they could be something from the

95
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,209
1970s where there's just a couple wires

96
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,060
and when the sensor feels a pressure on

97
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,480
the plate it dumps tune into the can you

98
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,709
can have SCADA systems they're awesome

99
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,018
before we had SCADA systems we had

100
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,790
distributed control systems which make a

101
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,350
bunch of parts of the processes happen

102
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,000
together at once you have a bunch of

103
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,319
controllers out there that do various

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,599
mechanical things

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,189
it synchronizes them but SCADA systems

106
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,170
are even more sophisticated those are

107
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:59,049
very very fancy digital systems that

108
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,268
organize your production timeline and

109
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,639
know how much your production levels are

110
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,200
per day in per hour and all of that is

111
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,239
dynamically changing over time by

112
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,399
operator control so that's that's kind

113
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,409
of cool but industrial control systems

114
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,819
aren't necessarily SCADA systems so

115
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,920
please don't use those terms

116
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,719
interchangeably and please don't think

117
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,310
that there's no digital industrial

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,099
control systems that aren't SCADA

119
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:25,180
because there's lots of digital but dumb

120
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:27,340
industrial control systems so where do

121
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,120
we see industrial control systems so I

122
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,789
do a talk called ICS but Stu and ICS

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,949
buts is about how we use ICS as an

124
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:37,810
exception everywhere like when we're

125
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:39,970
talking about all these general rules we

126
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,770
have an IT we're like yeah scan your

127
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,789
whole environment but don't but don't

128
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:49,000
scan ICS so we try to kind of treat

129
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:53,050
these as exceptional situations but ICS

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,840
system ICS security is all around us ICS

131
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,090
are in electrical power plants that are

132
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,330
keeping the lights on in this room they

133
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,008
are in manufacturing that got all of the

134
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,930
supplies for this conference here the

135
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:07,210
transportation systems that ship them to

136
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,860
the door they're in oil and gas which

137
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,780
provides the gas to our cars and the

138
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,130
heat to our buildings they're in water

139
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,008
treatment when you turn the faucet on

140
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,349
they're in logistics they get the

141
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:19,360
aircraft from point A to point B when

142
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:21,159
you have any kind of automation and

143
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,139
systems and this has been the case for a

144
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:26,860
long time you have industrial control

145
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:29,919
systems there in the world we have a lot

146
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,259
of challenges in ot environments right

147
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,698
now so the first one is pretty obvious

148
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:35,680
it's that these systems are really

149
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,659
really really important to how we live

150
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,849
right think about all the things I just

151
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:41,620
mentioned all the verticals they are

152
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:43,330
things that are transparent to our daily

153
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,729
life you turn on the faucet you expect

154
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,990
water to come out you pretty much expect

155
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,340
the power to come on when you turn the

156
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,370
light unless you grew up somewhere where

157
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,900
there's really unstable power we're used

158
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,250
to these things working and we don't

159
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,349
really think about them working in the

160
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,280
background but they're super important

161
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:59,950
think of

162
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:04,989
maersk being hit by ransomware a couple

163
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:07,690
years ago when you know they the impact

164
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,280
of Maris being infected was overarching

165
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,480
it reached in all kinds of different

166
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,429
industries all of a sudden we couldn't

167
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,370
get Oreo cookies because they're

168
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,380
shipping wasn't working right so ICS is

169
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,940
something that goes ignored until

170
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,010
something goes catastrophic ly wrong

171
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,480
until something explodes or we turn in

172
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:25,450
the faucet and water doesn't come out

173
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,730
and of course that makes industrial

174
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,950
control systems desirable targets for

175
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,010
both insiders who are angry at their

176
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,750
company and more sophisticated

177
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,210
adversaries who are like hey you know

178
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,610
it's suck the power not going on when

179
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,130
you turn on a light switch or water not

180
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,300
coming out or contaminated water coming

181
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,930
out when you turn on the faucet

182
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,870
bad stuff right so yeah that people want

183
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,360
to impact those systems and because

184
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,229
those systems on more and more internet

185
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,169
worked and there's a lot more

186
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:57,610
convergence between our IT systems and

187
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,650
our ot systems they're looking very

188
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,419
similar these days there's they're

189
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,849
facing a lot more of the commodity

190
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:06,580
attacks as well that are impacting our

191
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,500
IT networks so yes ransomware if it

192
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,840
moves over to an OT network is going to

193
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,090
do some bad things that was interesting

194
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,890
that's just to keep you awake I see on

195
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,500
your phones back there anyway this is

196
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,180
super important stuff guys so anyway so

197
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,550
yeah there's more commodity attacks out

198
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,860
there and I said earlier we treat it

199
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,810
like an edge case we are like yeah yeah

200
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,490
patch all the systems but yeah not those

201
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,100
ones and over in ICS we just don't do

202
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,870
those so we treat we either ignore it

203
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,880
completely or treat it as this weird

204
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,229
edge case that doesn't affect us that

205
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,219
much when it's like the thing that

206
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:42,250
impacts us at most in the world and

207
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,130
unfortunately as there's been AI t know

208
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,539
T convergence over the last 10 20 years

209
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,479
we've done a really bad job of

210
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:50,830
interfacing with ot personnel so we've

211
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,020
come in there and we've been like why

212
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,849
you're under running Windows NT that's

213
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,940
terrible get it off your network and

214
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,010
they're like let me tell you the 15 page

215
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,360
explanation of why I cannot upgrade from

216
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,190
Windows and he and we're like that's

217
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,180
fine you're getting fired if you don't

218
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:08,460
get that upgraded to Windows 2018 or

219
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,220
whatever

220
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,380
yeah so we we were horrible to them and

221
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,080
they hate us and we also think that

222
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,509
they're not doing their jobs which is

223
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,520
another issue I mean they really in a

224
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,870
lot of cases are their job is making

225
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,120
sure that the light goes on when you

226
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,949
turn on the switch so we have this

227
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,320
antagonist ik relationship going on

228
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:29,449
between IT and ot and that's a really

229
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,718
big problem

230
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:36,060
there are also nearly infinite

231
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,250
proprietary technologies going on in ICS

232
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,900
and in the ot environments there's tons

233
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,250
of vendors out there there's tons of

234
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,529
verticals like we talked about think

235
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,240
about how wide manufacturing is you

236
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,890
manufacture everything from like drugs

237
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,450
and pharmaceuticals to like I do

238
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,010
lanyards for your badges like this all

239
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,140
gets manufactured this is all different

240
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,300
equipment that makes this stuff like so

241
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,550
super wide vendor space lots of

242
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,770
proprietary technologies and a lot of it

243
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,479
is legacy it's been around for a long

244
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,310
time and the systems that make your

245
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,020
lanyards they're not replacing them

246
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,689
every five years they're like really

247
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:13,439
really expensive systems and they run

248
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,330
older system technologies and because of

249
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,580
these legacy and obscure technologies a

250
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:21,870
lot of our familiar IT systems just

251
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,820
don't work there which sucks so why do I

252
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,620
do this job why do I work in ICS

253
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,050
security where I could be working with

254
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,089
wonderful modern technologies like EDR

255
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,400
and dealing with Windows 10 systems that

256
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:35,459
have good security and stuff because

257
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,910
this is super super important industrial

258
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:40,619
control systems run our world and a lot

259
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,870
of them are digital these days yes

260
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,209
they're still analog fail-safes and

261
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,640
analog industrial control systems out

262
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,579
there but a lot of systems are now

263
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,529
digital and a lot of them are running on

264
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:55,890
more IT based systems because it's cheap

265
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:57,540
and it's easy and people like it so we

266
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,750
really need to keep these systems secure

267
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,010
and I hope that you can at least at the

268
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,900
end of this talk appreciate how

269
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,810
important these systems out are and how

270
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,449
prevalent they are and we're facing a

271
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,400
lot of threats so we're facing commodity

272
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,709
threats because I said there's a lot of

273
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,420
convergence between you know IT

274
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:16,949
environments and ot environments we're

275
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,779
starting to see more Windows systems

276
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,790
risk

277
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:21,259
to see more network connectivity we're

278
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,420
starting to see more commercial routers

279
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:25,519
and things these systems are starting to

280
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,889
look a lot more like IT systems that are

281
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,389
more familiar to us and that means that

282
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:32,749
they're vulnerable to things like worms

283
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:34,490
ransomware and a lot of those things can

284
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:36,230
have more of an impact on those systems

285
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,879
because they're more vulnerable and

286
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,670
they're more obsolete and they're less

287
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:44,059
monitored so they can have a big impact

288
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,439
there's insider threats so there's you

289
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:47,029
know the exponent ex-employee at the

290
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:51,430
power plant who's really mad one of the

291
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:54,559
first cyber take a drink impacts on an

292
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,758
industrial control system was a sewage

293
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,639
treatment plant this is long before

294
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,680
Stuxnet in Australia where a angry

295
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,350
operator dumped tons of sewage because

296
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,229
he got fired and he knew how to control

297
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,980
remotely control the sewage system and

298
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,180
it was a horrible mess and of course

299
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,850
there's targeted attacks there's

300
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,800
espionage learning how we do our

301
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,259
operations the United States for various

302
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,758
reasons and reconnaissance so maybe they

303
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:21,319
could shut off the power later or make

304
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,759
water polluted later or do something

305
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:25,040
horrible in the future when there's a

306
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:27,860
case to do that and there's of course

307
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,079
act of sabotage that goes on usually in

308
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,509
conduction with political events or

309
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,149
wartime events etc so that's actually

310
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,709
happening there's a lot of foothold

311
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,730
building going on in the industrial

312
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:42,439
space right now unfortunately

313
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,870
it's also a really really cool field oh

314
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:46,849
my gosh guys like it's it's soo these

315
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,949
are unending challenges for security

316
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,870
people like this is a whole new wide

317
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:52,609
world of technologies and vendors and

318
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,290
protocols we need to do a lot of

319
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,600
vulnerability research we need to learn

320
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,279
how to do forensics on industrial

321
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,959
devices and we need to know how to do a

322
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,220
lot of protocol analysis in these

323
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,279
industrial protocols that are

324
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,290
proprietary and undocumented etc and

325
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,540
there's a lot of easy wins like I call

326
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,370
myself an IT and ot marriage counselor a

327
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,800
lot because a lot of what I do is sit in

328
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,420
a room interest mend relationships that

329
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,149
have been totally destroyed between

330
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:20,120
operational teams and IT security teams

331
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:21,829
and doing this has an immediate impact

332
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,230
on security posture we all know there's

333
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:25,699
no unhackable system but we're we're

334
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,829
building defense-in-depth right we're

335
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:28,189
trying to be better our deterrence and

336
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:31,370
bill

337
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,260
better our security posture so all we

338
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,090
can do is is keep building on to that

339
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,620
and rebuilding those relationships and

340
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:39,200
doing little bits of research here and

341
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,910
there make a big difference so there's

342
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,320
some common misconceptions about ot I

343
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,900
want to blast through really fast so the

344
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,700
first one is ot staff don't care about

345
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,470
security they don't care they're not

346
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,590
patching anything they won't scan

347
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,360
anything okay so they do care about

348
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:56,090
security but what they care about is

349
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,740
consequences and if you don't change you

350
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,840
need up you need to do a big shift in

351
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,340
your mental understanding of what's

352
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,920
going on in these environments it's a

353
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,450
different perspective completely and we

354
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,209
should have the same perspective an IT

355
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,280
but we suck at risk modeling so we're

356
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,780
really bad at it all t people think

357
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,360
about consequences and we should too

358
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,560
they think about my worst day ever is

359
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,720
the power going out and a bunch of

360
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,650
people dying or the plane falling out of

361
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,060
the sky or our sewage treatment plant

362
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,160
contaminating a body of water those are

363
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,290
solid consequences that they care about

364
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,780
they don't care if that's caused by an

365
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,510
insider doing a cyberattack or a piece

366
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,740
of mechanical equipment failing what

367
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,390
they do know is they care about that

368
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,920
specific consequence and then from there

369
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,130
they can tree down and think about the

370
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,319
things that could cause that consequence

371
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,689
now we NIT tend to do like hunting in a

372
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,010
vacuum we say I'm gonna look for a bad

373
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,040
guy so I'm gonna look for somebody

374
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,470
misusing SMB or I'm gonna look for

375
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,209
somebody who's dumping stuff from a

376
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,890
domain controller we think about things

377
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:57,410
in a vacuum which is actually really bad

378
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:59,840
we should be doing this thinking about

379
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,670
consequences seeing which is if the

380
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,260
entire industrial network is infected

381
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,630
with configure does it cause a

382
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,560
consequence you care about think about

383
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,720
that for a minute

384
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,760
we as security IT security people are

385
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,620
gonna be like yeah yeah yeah it's

386
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,960
configure we gotta clean everything the

387
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:18,710
OT person goes okay I did consequence

388
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,440
and risk modeling and I said if there's

389
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,570
no impact on these systems that will

390
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,730
decrease performance by X percent it's

391
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,890
fine if they're infected I've actually

392
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,300
Madol this out and I've evaluated what

393
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:31,100
impact configure will have on these

394
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,229
systems and it does not result in a

395
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,550
consequence I care about now what would

396
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,470
have a consequence is bringing them down

397
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,990
for three days at millions and millions

398
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,510
and millions of dollars or cost that is

399
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,510
a big impact rate

400
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:46,730
so there's also ICS is a singular

401
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,380
monolithic thing so there's a ton of

402
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,010
verticals in industrial we just talked

403
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,810
about them all

404
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,660
that's huge there's hundreds of vendors

405
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,180
and they've thousands of products and

406
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,890
product releases it's a huge space it's

407
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,479
much bigger than IT in a lot of cases

408
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,520
there's way more operating systems and

409
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,290
protocols going on in industrial then

410
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,620
there isn't a traditional IT environment

411
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,839
so there's tons of work to be done there

412
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,670
and none of it looks the same it's all

413
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,820
different analysis and protocol

414
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:16,550
dissection and stuff and then we have

415
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,050
the ice IT people who see ot systems on

416
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,949
shodhan and they're like the world's

417
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:24,260
ending I see a power plant and maybe it

418
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,730
is maybe it isn't industrial systems are

419
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,040
really really complex we talked about

420
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,110
processes earlier processes are complex

421
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,520
there's tons of processes process loops

422
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,950
that go into power getting into your

423
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,140
house from generation to transmission

424
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,260
you know it's it's tons of stuff going

425
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,610
on and there's lots of safety controls

426
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,709
in place because we think about these

427
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,240
consequences so again we're thinking

428
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,310
about consequences so we think about

429
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,440
something exploding how do we contain

430
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,969
that explosion we don't care if it's a

431
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,709
cyber and thing that's causing the

432
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,150
explosion but we have to think about

433
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:55,609
that consequence and contain it so we

434
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,520
build in like analog or physical safety

435
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,529
controls can't bring may damage a system

436
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,750
or have no impact at all hooking buttons

437
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:03,620
maybe there's a safety system in place

438
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,390
maybe there isn't

439
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,029
maybe there's a human operator there

440
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,040
looking at changes maybe there isn't an

441
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,570
adversary really has to work hard to

442
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,730
understand this stuff and a lot of it

443
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,620
try takes a ton of reconnaissance most

444
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:19,100
industrial attacks we look at take year

445
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,959
a year of reconnaissance to investigate

446
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,020
the system before an impact is attempted

447
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,609
and so simply seeing an HMI in shodhan

448
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,900
does not mean that something's going to

449
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,690
explode tomorrow

450
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,459
aha air capping so my industrial network

451
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,780
or my ot environment it's air gap so I

452
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,020
don't have to worry about it yeah it's

453
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:39,030
not that's a lie it's not air gapped

454
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,010
maybe if you're really lucky it's in a

455
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,709
different feel and which is not air

456
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:46,170
capping guys VLANs repeat after me VLANs

457
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,790
are not air gapped VLANs are not air

458
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,400
keping come on okay good all right

459
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:53,099
you're with me here it's not layer two

460
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:56,459
attacks are a real thing and dmz is in

461
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,620
industrial are varied in their actual

462
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,570
solidity there's usually a lot of holes

463
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,950
poked through firewalls to the

464
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,420
industrial environment for various

465
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,730
reasons there's cloud services in

466
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:08,819
industrial now there's monitoring

467
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,910
services statistical analysis historian

468
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,770
services etcetera so and there's always

469
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,600
people bridging out of the industrial

470
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,750
network to like vendors and stuff too so

471
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,520
completely breaking segmentation and

472
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,319
then there's they're really hard to

473
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,109
learn how am I ever going to move from

474
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,000
IT security to ot security it's really

475
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:28,949
not that bad you start with a small

476
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,630
chunk you understand that it's a huge

477
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,340
space it's a massive field of its own

478
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,620
and you start with something small you

479
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,500
say I'm gonna learn how to program a PLC

480
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,939
or I'm gonna dissect this protocol I'm

481
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,280
gonna learn Modbus really well over

482
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,780
learned dnp3 really well you just start

483
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,280
somewhere you just start with with

484
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,379
relevant to you and interesting to you

485
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,629
and you start somewhere and there's lots

486
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,510
of familiar IT systems in ot networks

487
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,280
it's full of Windows now guys these HMIS

488
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,860
that are doing the fancy control screens

489
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,020
are all like XP embedded and stuff so

490
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,810
like that's that's what they are and

491
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,520
that's what they're supposed to be and

492
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,139
some security is better than no security

493
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,550
like get out there and try to do

494
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,540
something to impact this really

495
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:12,629
important space so how do you start as a

496
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:15,240
security person getting into ot so I'll

497
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,070
talk about two cases one is you're in an

498
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,690
organization that has an OT team right

499
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,610
now and you're trying to fix things and

500
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,320
do the security better or you're just

501
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,100
interested in doing it as a hobby or a

502
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,300
career so if you have ot in-house

503
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,250
understand that you need to rebuild that

504
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,750
relationship but you need to see things

505
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,750
from the OT perspective look at

506
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,920
consequences I recommend donuts when you

507
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,420
go in there you want to meet those

508
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,830
operators and try to rebuild that

509
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,720
relationship have good easy

510
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,580
conversations don't come in there

511
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,200
looking like an auditor because they hi

512
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,260
eight auditors because auditors don't

513
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,370
understand that ot works differently

514
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,830
understand that things like bad pen

515
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,300
tests and bad security audits probably

516
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,010
ruined their perspective and their

517
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,500
understanding of what cybersecurity is

518
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,940
and appreciate and leverage the

519
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,440
knowledge they have about their systems

520
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,100
they know the process is better than

521
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,260
anybody else and consider how IT and ot

522
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,030
convergence can best be achieved in your

523
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,460
environment so how can you share

524
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,960
resources how can you build your instant

525
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,310
response and your emergency management

526
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,490
plans together your disaster recovery

527
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:16,409
plans together can you use things that

528
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,210
they've built like they may have really

529
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,130
great great emergency response plans

530
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,370
because they think about these physical

531
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,090
consequences keep an open mind that's

532
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,959
the bottom line

533
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,550
fight your biases as a cyber security IT

534
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,050
professional and try to think like an

535
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,080
operators start trying to think about

536
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:37,620
consequences and about the the process

537
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,210
is actually in use so if you just want

538
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,350
to learn ot security you're gonna you're

539
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,550
gonna need to start somewhere and I

540
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,300
recommend starting with the Purdue

541
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:48,090
reference model like all things like the

542
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,639
kill chain and like the OSI model it's

543
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,230
not perfect it's not perfect and there's

544
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,120
endless debates about throwing it out

545
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:56,010
because it's not perfect model it's

546
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,899
educational it helps you understand kind

547
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,160
of how things are put together it's

548
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,200
still a good teaching tool and it'll

549
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,870
help you understand what's in industrial

550
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,700
networks so at the top of the industrial

551
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,739
network you've got your your corporate

552
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,420
network and that's like your servers and

553
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,160
your workstations and stuff that's the

554
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,530
network you're familiar with and then

555
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,680
there's this dmz at level 3.5 that's

556
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:20,490
usually that's separation air get not

557
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,200
air capping your view and it goes into

558
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,720
your DMZ or firewall that goes in here

559
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,520
at DMZ to go into your operational

560
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,020
environment and that's where you have

561
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,790
like jump servers and stuff to get

562
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,590
across and maybe a navy or a patch

563
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,840
management relay that goes into that

564
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,000
environment then beneath that you've got

565
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,129
a bunch of Windows boxes or Linux boxes

566
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,660
those are like your your workstations

567
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,000
where your engineers and your operators

568
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,280
work your analysis and patching machines

569
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,650
for the industrial systems your

570
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,899
reporting servers your like your your

571
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:52,200
systems that do like historian services

572
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,150
and stuff like that and beneath that you

573
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,890
start having like operator workstations

574
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,540
and your HMIS you

575
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,400
machines that are showing the human

576
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,980
machine interface for the devices like

577
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,549
red light bad green light good stuff

578
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,910
like that

579
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:07,740
we need that you've got PLC's so you're

580
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,390
more simple computers that are actually

581
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,210
issuing controls to the lower level

582
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,610
devices like your your actuators that

583
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:16,920
make the the door open or make the

584
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,020
temperature go up and down etc etc or

585
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,120
they accept impact from things like

586
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,389
sensors that say the temperature is too

587
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,370
high or too low and so you've got very

588
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,400
simple devices on the bottom moving up

589
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,500
to more familiar ite like devices at

590
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,110
higher levels and each one of these

591
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,929
levels speaks different protocols to the

592
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,178
one beneath it and above it so in the

593
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,890
one process environment in OneNote II

594
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,690
environment if you've got a ton of

595
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,549
protocols going on you've got a ton of

596
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,870
different devices going on they're all

597
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:49,520
speaking and functioning together

598
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:51,840
differently so a lot going on there

599
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,340
so I recommend you spend some time with

600
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,730
that and think about what's going on at

601
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,320
each level might experts in your org ask

602
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,320
some questions drop shadow them if you

603
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,330
can like they have a lot to offer you

604
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,659
also can do a lot of OS int in a space

605
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:08,370
and yeah I mean spend a lot of time on

606
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,630
Google and scripty you can find manuals

607
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,459
that you're not supposed to have for

608
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,650
lots of these devices especially legacy

609
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,000
old ones on script II go ahead get out

610
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,500
there and start looking into this stuff

611
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,910
pick a device that's interesting to you

612
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,000
or a verticle that's interesting to you

613
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,440
and we do have IT tools who that can be

614
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,940
used in industrial environments

615
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,700
Wireshark has a ton of industrial

616
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,740
protocol dissectors remember your

617
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,380
high-level protocols on the purdue model

618
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,760
will be more familiar to you than the

619
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,780
lower-level protocols that are like

620
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,010
serial or just simple electrical signals

621
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,600
they're gonna get weirder as they go

622
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,340
down the purdue model but they're also

623
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,409
in many cases going to get simpler

624
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,820
there's no encryption down there they're

625
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,280
they're relatively simple things that

626
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,139
you can learn

627
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,520
I got some resources take out your phone

628
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,900
take a picture if you're interested in

629
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,860
learning more here's some vlogs that

630
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,450
will help you learn more about

631
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:58,129
industrial I've got a couple at our site

632
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,550
that I've worked on like our reading

633
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,660
list and stuff the one that I did on

634
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,639
building you through the relationship

635
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,400
back up between IT and ot teams that

636
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,570
goes into this in more depth and sans

637
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,830
has some great training there's

638
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,120
commercial training out there where you

639
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,560
can learn more about industrial but

640
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,770
there's so much open source stuff out

641
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,840
there too so we have just a couple

642
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,100
minutes what questions do you guys have

643
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:27,830
about industrial what can I answer for

644
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:29,270
you that's the ultimate question that I

645
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,000
get asked in every single talk about

646
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:34,129
industrial that I do data diodes so data

647
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,480
diodes are these things you stick in a

648
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,640
network connection that only allowed

649
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,140
traffic one way and they seem like an

650
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,850
awesome idea you're supposed to put them

651
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,590
in your industrial network to keep

652
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,149
somebody from accessing things from the

653
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,580
wrong direction like the thing that's

654
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,050
reporting it's status can only report up

655
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,850
nothing can access it downward unless

656
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,210
you walk into the building sounds

657
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,770
awesome

658
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,990
I've seen them in like one facility ever

659
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,670
nobody actually uses them in practice

660
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,950
and I think it's a lot because it's

661
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:59,360
these systems are complex and it's hard

662
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,890
to do and it's hard to get a maintenance

663
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,020
window we might see more of them in the

664
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,840
future but everybody talks about them in

665
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,450
the space in industrial and we never see

666
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:14,230
them in use or in wide use at least like

667
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:14,230
it's crazy next yes sir

668
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,870
no I mean it's a mix it's a mix you can

669
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:32,410
see yes so my only seeing windows out

670
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:34,179
there especially at higher levels no I

671
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,980
mean there's Linux systems out there but

672
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,840
man building a sequel server is a really

673
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,690
easy way to do a historian database and

674
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,010
a XP embed it's a really easy way to

675
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,780
build a user interface that's

676
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,220
lightweight yeah you see you see

677
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,389
everything and then down at the PLC

678
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,830
level of course it's all proprietary

679
00:24:46,390 --> 00:25:01,630
operating systems Arduino whatever so

680
00:24:49,830 --> 00:25:03,220
yeah yes sir yes sir and we have on our

681
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:06,460
website as a company we've got a lot of

682
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,860
yes so I'm sorry yes they're prompting

683
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:12,280
me to read the question so is Russia

684
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:14,469
poking at our stuff yes we have a lot of

685
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,060
threat intelligence reports for a free

686
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,250
download on our site about that about

687
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,899
that a series we're seeing we do not

688
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,790
name nation states and our reports

689
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,980
it seems pretty apparent if you know the

690
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,240
correlation between various threat actor

691
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,800
names between companies but we do that

692
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,980
for a reason we never name threat actors

693
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,350
but there are advanced nation state type

694
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,240
adversaries that are building good

695
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,919
footholds in our environments and doing

696
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,080
a lot of reconnaissance about what's out

697
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,480
there I cannot tell you from a

698
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,770
geopolitical reason it's not my place to

699
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,170
tell you from a geopolitical standpoint

700
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,340
why they are doing that but I would be

701
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,080
very concerned that there are

702
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,820
nation-state advocate read between the

703
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,320
lines here please I would be very

704
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,600
concerned that there are nation-state

705
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,520
type adversaries building footholds and

706
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,419
doing extensive reconnaissance of our

707
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,420
industrial environments god I don't know

708
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:07,260
who is next I'm sorry

709
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:09,540
yes sir success stories oh my god I so

710
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,320
might my marriage counseling stuff I sit

711
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:14,428
in rooms with like I they pay not

712
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,830
exorbitant but reasonable lots of money

713
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,809
for me to sit in a room where their IT

714
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:21,809
and their ot teams meet for the first

715
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:24,540
time and they talk to each other and I

716
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:26,100
say like five words I like add in some

717
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,139
context like this every once in a while

718
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,090
and they're just meeting for the first

719
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,040
time and that makes all the difference

720
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,959
in the world all of a sudden the IT team

721
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,940
realizes for the OT team and sent

722
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,770
somebody to DEFCON one time and they're

723
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,110
really interested in security and then

724
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,879
the IOT team is like wait you're not

725
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:44,010
gonna make me patch the system that has

726
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,919
a 20-year support contract that I can't

727
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:50,070
break by upgrading the system oh do you

728
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,640
get it okay we can talk now so yeah all

729
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,990
the time

730
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,280
that's a really fun part of my job is

731
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,919
going in and seeing those those

732
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,240
relationships be rebuilt and people you

733
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,890
know starting to build better

734
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,040
understanding of how those teams are

735
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:06,090
going to converge do I have any time for

736
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:08,270
more questions or one more okay yes

737
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,270
ma'am

738
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:17,880
[Music]

739
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,879
I'm not laughing at you I'm laughing

740
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,190
with you ma'am she's she asked how often

741
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,900
do you see insecurity built into new

742
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,300
facilities new products and stuff in

743
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,460
industrial it's getting a little better

744
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,990
but okay so the thing I'll end with this

745
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,810
is cos this is a really important note

746
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:35,910
the lifecycle for industrial devices is

747
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,460
really really long when you go out and

748
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,560
you set up a power plant you're buying a

749
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,210
bunch of stuff at all levels of the per

750
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,350
to model you're buying your PLC's you're

751
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,950
buying your historians you're buying

752
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,909
your HMIS

753
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,010
you're buying your engineering

754
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,510
workstations from the same vendor and

755
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,940
they all work together because they've

756
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,500
been designed to work that way and

757
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:55,350
you're buying that with like a 20 or 30

758
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,700
year support contract and to keep using

759
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,620
that equipment and have it supported by

760
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,240
the vendor if you upgrade those systems

761
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,860
or you modify them they're either gonna

762
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,950
stop working with each other across

763
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,659
layers or they're going to they're gonna

764
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,070
stop supporting them they're do the tech

765
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:12,360
will no longer come out and support them

766
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:15,179
so yes the system's being built today

767
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,649
have more security built into them when

768
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,870
systems are going to be replaced with

769
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,390
those think more like the decades

770
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,129
instead of years when things break they

771
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,840
get replaced when there is an outage

772
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,450
window once a year some things get

773
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,129
upgraded it's a slow process because of

774
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:32,970
the way that these systems are designed

775
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,260
and implemented and upgraded I sorry I

776
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:37,110
don't think I've got time for any more

777
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:39,440
questions but catch me outside catch me

778
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,439
at the bar
