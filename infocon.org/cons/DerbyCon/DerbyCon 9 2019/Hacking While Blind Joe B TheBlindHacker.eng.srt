1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,150
for anything on blind SQL injection

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:07,289
that's not this talk my voice is dying I

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,750
talk too much

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,219
which ironic that I stream and I do

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,509
everything and I come to Derby home for

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:18,289
two days and I'm dead so it's gonna be a

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:23,310
my watch is going apeshit cuz it's no

8
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:32,549
time for my talk I know so this is my

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:34,079
first talk at Derby con it's been tastic

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,430
conference I am sad to see you go as

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,960
everybody's been saying so but with that

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,719
again he's hacking why blinds is to talk

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,600
about Who am I so I am the blind hacker

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,989
I try not to say that I'm disabled but

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,300
more or less differently-abled

16
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:53,489
this see so well what some of the things

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,680
that I also like to do is I still I'm a

18
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,739
big goonie a big gamer a big nerd a

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,800
total geek but I also like to consider

20
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:06,750
myself an educator a mentor in a life /

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,420
cyber coach at this point see I'm also

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,670
for my day job I'm a hacker a pen tester

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,680
red teamer my official job title

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,040
director of offensive security at active

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,470
cyber I also like beer and bourbon so if

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,400
you see me at bars be glad to take some

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:26,280
beer and bourbon off your hands let's

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,409
see so like you know other things that I

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,450
do so you know one of the things that I

30
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,140
personally like as a hacker I'm more of

31
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,210
a network guy

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,040
I'm more of a systems guy when you start

33
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,419
getting into some of the webapp stuff

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
it's a little tougher with the visually

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,540
impaired impairment uh you know I've got

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,759
my personal ways around it so those are

37
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,140
I'm getting better and better but you

38
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,250
know a lot of these other tools are

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,170
still built with a lot of GUI

40
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,299
functionality so it still gets tougher

41
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,280
mita now I gotta zoom out I wanna learn

42
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,439
where everything is and move forward

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,899
with that

44
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:00,210
so this Wildheart systems and I heart

45
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,729
networks those are a lot easier for me

46
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,179
mater I like to you know I still mod

47
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,890
codes games scripts I'm terrible at

48
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,649
coming up with something fresh but I

49
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,319
will find somebody wholesome

50
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:15,140
work and modify either suit my needs or

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,548
suit the the jobs needs I love modding

52
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,140
hardware and SBC's I know that sounds

53
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:20,959
weird someone blind trying to play

54
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,268
around with a soldering iron and things

55
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,010
like that but fortunately now I've

56
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:27,379
learned that for a few dollars I can

57
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:31,640
actually just have someone in trying to

58
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:34,909
do it and ship it to me it takes a month

59
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,260
to get to me sometimes because I'm sure

60
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:37,849
they're wondering why there's this weird

61
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,000
circuit board with the USB dongles

62
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,409
hanging off of it but I'll talk if

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,599
you're interested in more about that

64
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:47,179
stuff I have a lot of stuff on my

65
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:50,119
streams and I don't tweet about it much

66
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,220
but on my discord let's see what else I

67
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,129
have here so again really break it down

68
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,099
so the blind hacker I started its last

69
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:58,939
August it's so it's been a year or a

70
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,119
little over a year now

71
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:04,340
I don't but is it September still so

72
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,620
that's been something I kind of grew and

73
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,590
I started talking about doing the

74
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,370
streaming and mentoring because I wanted

75
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,989
to talk at Derby con and I was like I

76
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,959
you know I'm I can do this these are

77
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:20,239
things that I really want to do and so

78
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,620
then I was all about it all so yeah I've

79
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,299
got a couple years to prepare and then

80
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,299
in January Dave was like this would be

81
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:27,919
the last one well I guess I need to

82
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:30,739
submit a talk and present at the last

83
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,540
Derby con so here we are a lot of

84
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:34,879
community outreach one of the fantastic

85
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,409
things about being labeled the blind

86
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,819
hacker it's a lot of people go hey I'm

87
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:41,060
visually impaired I'm losing my vision

88
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:43,728
or I'm totally blind and I have no clue

89
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,590
how to use these tools so I get a lot of

90
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:48,260
community outreach people going hey what

91
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,180
are ways that I can use tools and hex

92
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,069
editors for the blind and things like

93
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,690
that and so I haven't found many of it

94
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:55,909
so again I grab people other people's

95
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,280
code i modded it and a couple of these

96
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:59,959
students that I was working with doing

97
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,430
dfi are classes now at least we're

98
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,109
getting them some of the tools in the

99
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,400
right order so if you're developer and

100
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,530
you want to help out I'll talk about

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,569
more that and some other slides but we

102
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,769
could definitely use more help for CLI

103
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:14,858
tools and then so that's the proactive

104
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,859
outreach

105
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,700
so what am i you know what I have is

106
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:24,380
called Labour's hereditary optic

107
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:27,650
neuropathy lho hen so what is that it's

108
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,230
a mitochondrial oh there's some fancy

109
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,450
words to you that I so essentially the

110
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,000
mitochondria of my optic nerve of my

111
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,370
whole nervous system they don't produce

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,170
100% energy if you remember from your

113
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,700
biology classes in school the motor

114
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,260
consciousness powerhouse the cell takes

115
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,240
the ATP inputs that power

116
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,610
well just imagine I'm trying to be in a

117
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,160
little GMP you know he's functioning at

118
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,900
40 50 percent so but it specifically

119
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,350
affects the center of my nerve so it's

120
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,419
the center of my vision that's blurry so

121
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,260
if you really wanted like go look some

122
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:02,810
stuff up I have it on my 14 484 genome

123
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,490
and allele so if you've ever seen the

124
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,500
genetic map count you know fourteen

125
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,210
thousand four hundred eighty four spaces

126
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,680
and that's the area that I've affected

127
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:16,520
by but to me that's I hit a button

128
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,380
that's life and just keep going right so

129
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,590
it's hard to explain what I see so I

130
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,790
found this terrible picture online so if

131
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,289
you look at the left picture it's

132
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:29,270
supposed to be a little girl holding a

133
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:30,860
sunflower and for me I my poor for

134
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,510
vision is actually mostly sharp for my

135
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,060
center vision it's very blurry it's not

136
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,890
black anymore it had earlier on when I

137
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,090
got a first affected I couldn't see

138
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,070
anything through the center of my vision

139
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,109
right now my extendo vision is the first

140
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,800
row in the center after that it's just

141
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,479
fuzzy colors that's an example so that's

142
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,250
pretty much what it's like the best way

143
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,599
I can say is it's kind of like when you

144
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,700
go underwater you come up with chlorine

145
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,740
I but focus that specifically in the

146
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,130
center so the right picture is what is

147
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,600
more affected by however I can see the

148
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,219
sunflowers or daisies in the background

149
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,440
whereas what I'm looking at is typically

150
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:08,720
blurry or kind of misformed or

151
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,910
structured um so how I do work a lot of

152
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,919
accessibility options I particularly

153
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,810
prefer magnification still since I still

154
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,789
still have a larger portion of my vision

155
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,600
but at times I have used screen readers

156
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:23,030
um you know a text-to-speech voice to

157
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,710
text and you know text output from

158
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,469
terminals and stuff if I have time I'll

159
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:31,210
try to show you guys an example of that

160
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:33,070
um so uh screen magnifiers screen

161
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,299
readers so my workflow a lot of people

162
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,860
like oh what is your workflow like it's

163
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,330
got to be you can just I think it's the

164
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,460
same as every other pen duster red

165
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,010
teamer because I don't think I do it

166
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,140
differently I just look at its

167
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,510
differently you know same thing a

168
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:50,979
numerate innumerate try harder RIA

169
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:54,400
numerate exploit you know yeah grab a

170
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:59,500
foothold and take home the bacon I'll

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,409
write a report so you know how you know

172
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,760
how I do it kind of continued like

173
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,740
specifically like the hacking I

174
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,250
definitely prefer CLI things like

175
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,140
Metasploit and map um if you develop CLI

176
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,930
tools fantastic I probably use them

177
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,960
thank you if your tools are heavily GUI

178
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,610
such as necess cobalt strike it's a cool

179
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,590
trick GUI I get to play a little bit

180
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,420
more with because they do have the CLI

181
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,000
you can run a lot more convinced these

182
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,470
days and moving towards that but I just

183
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,110
want to say like the difficulty

184
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,180
sometimes is that the GUI there is

185
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,100
really tough to use when I'm trying to

186
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,380
zoom out if I exploited a bunch of boxes

187
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,120
that are chained together and I it's not

188
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,409
organized right it's still hard for me

189
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,380
to see it so that's why it's kind of

190
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,520
like a mint face and then of course my

191
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,320
toughest challenges again still is uh um

192
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,510
things that are like heavy GUI heavy so

193
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,990
I love bloodhound but you guys that

194
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,940
develop it got it from neo4j and Java

195
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,700
cuz I can't if I was fully blind there's

196
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,410
no way I could use it at all so you know

197
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,180
if you're again if you're trying to

198
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,680
develop tools stick the command lines

199
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,419
things like that are better for

200
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,419
accessibility and everyone

201
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:15,030
so so how to approach people by the way

202
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,100
so a lot of things people go like they

203
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,559
come up to me and they're shy I'm not a

204
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,870
shy guy I'm kind of extroverted still an

205
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,720
introverted hacker but I like kind of

206
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,430
outgoing I guess um so you know I would

207
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,810
but however I do advise that you move

208
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,979
very slowly and cautiously towards

209
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,199
flying people they are usually like

210
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:34,020
rabid animals at first kidding you're

211
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,940
kidding just like a normal human being

212
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,199
right about some of you that have

213
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,450
approached me or know me just so you

214
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,070
come up say hi sometimes you know if I

215
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,070
don't recognize you right away you know

216
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,270
to say your name things like that you

217
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,810
know and if you're if you're in a

218
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,550
situation where you know that you think

219
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,319
that they need help one it just just

220
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,520
Astor's hate you need help just like a

221
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,700
normal person right it's kind of the

222
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,899
whole consent rules these days uh early

223
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,610
on when I started losing my vision

224
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,500
sometimes people would come up and like

225
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,360
snatch things out of my hands like oh

226
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,920
you're not doing it right like how am I

227
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,830
to learn how to do it right if you're

228
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,969
not gonna let me fumble through this

229
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,830
some of the things I say if you do hire

230
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,480
visually impaired people or work with

231
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,579
them you know just try to align with

232
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,260
them in some way um you know what I mean

233
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:18,930
by that is if you know that they have

234
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,459
similar interests you kind of it's again

235
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,800
it's a normal human being thing just try

236
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,359
to approach them in align with them and

237
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,699
like say hey I understand what you're

238
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:30,420
going through or I'm trying to I want to

239
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,579
align with you recognize the difference

240
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,170
between frustration and misunderstanding

241
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,479
because sometimes you have people go oh

242
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:39,390
take a right left at the red thing go

243
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,740
right and hold on and then they kind of

244
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,329
like oh are you stupid like now I'm

245
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,190
misunderstanding right now because I

246
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:46,529
don't know these things or these words

247
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,940
you're saying at times you know

248
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:50,070
fortunately I have a lot of my decisions

249
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,390
still so I don't run into that often but

250
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,829
I see other people who are totally blind

251
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,439
and they're like they try too personally

252
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:57,000
hey I'm here you know don't forget like

253
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,110
you know they know you're there they can

254
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,579
hear right yeah but but when they go hey

255
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,120
are you trying to get somewhere do you

256
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:04,500
need help

257
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,329
and then you and then you're trying to

258
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,010
describe to them you gotta use you know

259
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:10,500
hey it's actually about two blocks up

260
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,569
it's two blocks over you know you're

261
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,910
gonna smell this plunking by potentially

262
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,610
you know try to again focus on what they

263
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,980
might see or hear themselves oh there's

264
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,000
a terrible traffic stop here you're

265
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,310
gonna want to be careful or you're not

266
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,920
gonna hit my car but

267
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,989
like that so I had a big example that I

268
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,459
wanted to say is like if you see me out

269
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,310
in the lobbies you know some people

270
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:35,180
sometimes still just go ciao Joe I'm

271
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:37,160
like me Joe where are other shows and

272
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,800
then people go you know over here and

273
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,969
I'm like you know visually give me a

274
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,959
larger wave because I'm not gonna be

275
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,350
able to see your face again unless

276
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,990
you're ten feet away or so so again the

277
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,089
big example is just do a big wave you

278
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,300
know maybe if I'm really confused still

279
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,800
come retrieve me you know come hit you

280
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:59,779
or over here and then you know I'll come

281
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,790
gladly come over see so how to learn

282
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:04,279
with someone with low vision

283
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,680
so you'll see LV for low vision VI

284
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,270
visually impaired and blind so there's

285
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,699
it's like different categories it's like

286
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,860
hard of hearing deaf things like that so

287
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,630
low vision is technically what I have

288
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,970
and I am visually impaired I'm not

289
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:19,010
actually applying so those are the key

290
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:22,339
differences there if you see LV the VI

291
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,080
um again just when you're approaching

292
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:25,160
people if you want to learn with them if

293
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,110
you want to teach from them or if you

294
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,400
want see beats hot by them it's still

295
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,400
just approach the mic inaudible

296
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,170
person they they well most educators

297
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,699
most people that are learning they want

298
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:38,120
to they're flexible they'll learn with

299
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:40,250
you just like with everything else give

300
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,450
them the same benefits of trying things

301
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,790
on their own kind of like the prior

302
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,800
slide just let people fumble through it

303
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,280
so that way and you know it takes less

304
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,479
and less time the more they do it right

305
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,069
outside of that encourage them just like

306
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,170
everybody else right hey you know you're

307
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,120
doing it you know here's some key things

308
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,650
that maybe I'm witnessing or seeing is

309
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,690
going on so here's some things you could

310
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,920
try differently but again they're gonna

311
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,130
fumble through it and do it on their own

312
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,680
anyway one of the things that has have

313
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:08,990
spy uh teacher who was like hey some of

314
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,339
my students are blind how do I deal that

315
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,440
nine it's like well if they ask for a

316
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,240
short time give them extra time don't

317
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,880
just inherently assume that they're

318
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,529
gonna need it um that happened a lot

319
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,180
when I was coming through high school

320
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,910
and right after I lost my vision because

321
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,010
I pressed it early it's not only started

322
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,420
affecting me at the age of sixteen so

323
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,740
then teachers were like oh he needs all

324
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,150
this extra time and we'll put him in

325
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,980
another room and all these things I'm

326
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,990
like oh I mean if you give it to me in a

327
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,580
format I can ingest and understand I was

328
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,100
done before most of the other students

329
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,160
anyway

330
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,750
so it's like no I don't actually know if

331
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,069
this exercise but if I go hey you know

332
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,110
what this is something difficult for me

333
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,470
understand that might be something that

334
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,940
will happen recaps you know sometimes if

335
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,610
you're going over a complicated or

336
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,830
sensitive topic having a recap module

337
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,370
where you're like hey did you understand

338
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,370
the concept

339
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:08,390
hello folks Andy here unfortunately for

340
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,550
some reason the audio dropped at this

341
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,610
point but we zooms at about the 20

342
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:16,209
minute 17 seconds all for the

343
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,210
inconvenience

344
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,140
your this is what's going on and see if

345
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,340
they can you know just like with a

346
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,080
regular education see if they can

347
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,870
reiterate back to you what you just

348
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,899
iterate it to them

349
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:33,070
let's see be inclusive of course that's

350
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,540
one of the big things that we talk about

351
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,040
here in 2019 but some of the things that

352
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,899
I don't see is people being more

353
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,240
inclusive to even those people with

354
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,680
disabilities it's still kind of a hard

355
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,130
thing when you shun people and of course

356
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:49,240
lots of shell stuff SSH actually

357
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:52,510
ironically I talked to TJ Noll and since

358
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,190
his community our hijab with offset I

359
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,230
told him hey I'd love an accessibility

360
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,730
version where I don't have a GUI but I

361
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,200
can spend up a screen reader and I'll

362
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,480
help you drop tools in there and

363
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,520
literally he's like oh yeah I'll go I'll

364
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,140
go talk to God milk tomorrow and then

365
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,690
like today alls then he shows me

366
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,850
something that now there is a Cali

367
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:15,010
accessibility option in the meta

368
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:18,280
packages so thanks to that let's see so

369
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:21,490
some some examples some examples of like

370
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,320
me at times going you know hey is this

371
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,520
version is this something based on my

372
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,889
visual impairment or is this something

373
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:32,080
based on kind of my knowledge so I took

374
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:33,970
the ACP at the beginning of 2018 now so

375
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,210
I actually only missed it by one of the

376
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:40,180
like 15-point boxes there's 25 point box

377
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,830
and I popped the shell on it but I

378
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,390
couldn't find the user and the reason

379
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,169
why is because the tool that I used was

380
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:49,030
the wind Windows email and it pulled the

381
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:50,950
clicker text password and user name out

382
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,070
and put it in the file but if the file

383
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,490
is so big I kept scrolling through and

384
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,659
so then I was like alright so moving on

385
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,810
so it was kind of one of those things

386
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:05,200
like alright I get it now and then other

387
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:07,540
things just I love plain text shell

388
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,950
output is fantastic you know if you're

389
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,190
gonna build Huey's make sure you add a

390
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,750
CLI somewhere or the ability to use some

391
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,610
kind of a PID control it that's another

392
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,870
thing I've talked to you to people that

393
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,969
are totally blind about like writing an

394
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:21,010
API for necess even though they sort of

395
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,680
got rid of it oddly it still works

396
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,270
sometimes but like writing it in

397
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,330
terminal so that way they can still use

398
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,230
the CLI I was going to give an example

399
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,480
of nmap shell output but we're running

400
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,040
low on time here so if you want to hear

401
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,690
what it end map shell output sounds like

402
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,129
later I'll crank up some speakers where

403
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,620
we'll hijack some and we'll play some

404
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:44,240
but we'll just keep doing that any

405
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:45,770
questions if if you're really far out to

406
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:54,500
use the honor system just yeah your

407
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:55,610
question I don't have the queued up at

408
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,890
the moment so I'm definitely gonna have

409
00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:03,830
to take a moment to do it elsewhere

410
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:05,360
all right if you want to contact me on

411
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:07,040

I'm streamer by the way as the blind

413
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,668

that I do hack the Box I stream I do

415

417
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,660
in there and you know you're not blind

418
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,370
and you know try to troll me or why

419
