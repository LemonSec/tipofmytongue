1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,010
I am yep you have the right person

2
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:32,009
alright I think we're gonna get started

3
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,260
here all I want to thank everyone for

4
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,420
coming today and hear my presentation

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,879
and I want to thank also Jason for

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,500
drawing in a crowd for me so hopefully

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,239
hopefully I can share some nuggets of

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,250
information today I want to share a

9
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,260
little bit about just what I've learned

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,000
over the past couple years around I've

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,550
been in information security now doing

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,530
this for about 12 years and over the

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,930
past probably two years I've realized

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,000
that there are some changes of things

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,100
that just need to happen around the big

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,129
data analytics place that we can improve

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,390
and get better and I've looking have

18
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,479
things that I've done over the past

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,880
probably 1012 years has have anybody in

20
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,890
here written a script or a file or

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,658
anything does anybody here have probably

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,670
hundreds of those packed away across

23
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,020
probably ten different computers and you

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,320
wish that you could find it whenever you

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,179
need that's same for me so I I've had

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,130
done so many different things you so

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,080
many tools over the years that I wish I

28
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,789
had a repository in a place where I

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,710
could go back and leverage you continue

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,060
to build on that information so that's

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,890
kind of what I want to share today with

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,820
everyone are some some opportunities

33
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,490
where we can all get better and do that

34
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,689
it's a little bit about me I my job

35
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,089
title I'm an information security

36
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,758
architect that's really a fancy way of

37
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,310
saying that 80% of my job is doing

38
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,409
PowerPoint and on the days that I feel

39
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,930
dangerous I'll crack open Excel so

40
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,729
that's but um but in my spare time

41
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,770
security is a hobby as well so when I go

42
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,840
home spend time with family than a night

43
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,670
my boss always jokes that I don't sleep

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,860
because I love doing security research I

45
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,200
love reading about technology following

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,149
I'm on Twitter you probably don't know

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,280
of me as much but I probably know of you

48
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,649
a more of a lurker doing that and you'll

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,760
see that Twitter is crossed off of the

50
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,610
top so if you see me in the brochures

51
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,010
Ryan underscore alkanes well for years I

52
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,959
have wanted the handle Ryan a try no it

53
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,060
is driven me crazy that you've had to do

54
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,860
underscores and all these fancy so I

55
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,930
thought I'm gonna I'm gonna own my dummy

56
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,730
and I'm gonna take this back so I looked

57
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,709
up who had the handle a couple weeks ago

58
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,899
search them out they didn't have direct

59
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,060
messages so I figured out exactly the

60
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,730
kind of location the country did my

61
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,200
google hacking spotted I think this is

62
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,940
the person who it is their white pages

63
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,429
started searching all of his followers

64
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,840
from Twitter over on Facebook try to

65
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,060
identify them on Facebook send him a

66
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,290
direct message thinking man what's it's

67
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,989
gonna cost you've got to be a hundred

68
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,129
dollars get my handle is gonna cost

69
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,079
what's the what's the going to rate and

70
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,510
I asked and he offers that up to me so

71
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:57,159
it was pretty awesome so in a way giving

72
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,108
back if anybody after this conference

73
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,790
wants the underscore Ryan underscore

74
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:02,790
Elkins it's up for grabs

75
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,379
so let's get to the information I want

76
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:10,119
to start with thank-yous as well so part

77
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,230
of part of being in information security

78
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,030
is learning from everyone else that's

79
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,920
why we're here that's why I go to

80
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,599
derbycon year every year to touch base

81
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,458
with all the people all the experts that

82
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,349
I've crossed paths with it's it's

83
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,690
awesome to learn from everyone and I'm

84
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:24,698
I'm not in expert in all the things that

85
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,290
I'm going to show you today but I feel

86
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:29,049
that I've been able to learn and gain

87
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,608
knowledge from tons of different experts

88
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:31,870
across the industry where I can start to

89
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,940
piece that together and that's what I

90
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,980
love about security that's why I I get

91
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,049
so excited about the job is we're in

92
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,119
this to solve puzzles fine solve the

93
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,280
world's most challenging problems where

94
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,109
hey at a global scale every single day

95
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,209
it's exciting it's powerful the things

96
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:48,280
that we can do that's why I love it but

97
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,870
I also love that we don't have to learn

98
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,639
everything ourselves we can pull the

99
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,109
information we have an open community

100
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,669
where there's there's so much

101
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,440
information out there just how can we

102
00:03:54,669 --> 00:04:00,879
best leverage it how can we use it and

103
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,349
how can we apply it effectively this

104
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,629
quote is something that's really

105
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:06,849
resonated with me and this was a

106
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:09,459
presentation by a David Rohde for Wired

107
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:12,548
but he mentions things will never move

108
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,169
this slowly again and I thought this was

109
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,720
a couple years ago said and that rings

110
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:18,699
so true we hear so much in our industry

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,959
around just burnout and how fast and

112
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,190
we're overwhelmed and we don't have

113
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,260
enough staff we don't have enough

114
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,000
resources how do we address this how do

115
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,650
we do with it how do we do this and

116
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,180
that's a problem it's just

117
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,460
it's everywhere you go you will never

118
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,710
not have enough work in your hopper to

119
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,180
finish the job you should always be busy

120
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,669
always doing this but we need to change

121
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,590
how we work how can we evolve so we are

122
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:40,090
not just following Meno processes and

123
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,349
being those bottlenecks we have to

124
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,330
evolve because the world is evolving

125
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,880
around us and we have to move either

126
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:51,490
faster than them or at least move with

127
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:53,740
them this is kind of my view of the

128
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,660
world from a security security

129
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,210
perspective so you have I call it the

130
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,070
poll on security this is the hundreds of

131
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,479
vendors it's the I charge square we're

132
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,889
going to sell you all these things that

133
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,330
you put this on your network in your

134
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,460
secure will fix it we're a hundred

135
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,349
percent good you're guaranteed these are

136
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,789
all the guarantees that you buy all the

137
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,310
shell for that we've spent millions of

138
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:14,919
dollars on over the past decade all on

139
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:18,580
your on-premise network tied together

140
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,990
offering you protection and that's not

141
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,159
where the world's headed and I see

142
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,560
that's not we're a little headed it's

143
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,630
it's already long past worth five years

144
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,669
behind already in terms of doing this

145
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,430
but you hear a lot of this concept

146
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:31,780
embedded security security by design

147
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,580
this is baking secure in its

148
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,020
decentralized in the model it's using it

149
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,389
as be some would call the security

150
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,190
champions getting decentralized that

151
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:41,349
information providing the standards the

152
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,180
guidance the controls enabling teams

153
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:44,650
empowering teams that are not in

154
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,720
security functions to make those

155
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,120
security security requirements bake

156
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,130
those into their solutions if we don't

157
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,099
there's going to be these fears of

158
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,630
applications running everywhere and they

159
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,460
can either have security or they don't

160
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,680
have to but it's going to happen one way

161
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,448
or another and we stick with this bolt

162
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,949
on security model we're going to fail

163
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:05,260
we're not going to scale and it's going

164
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,030
to be a false sense of security as Jason

165
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,310
previously kind of spoke about on that

166
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,020
top that's or in the prior talk that's

167
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,880
not where I want to be I signed up to be

168
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,948
in security to be on a winning team to

169
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,750
win to stay ahead of the adversaries and

170
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:18,970
everything that I want to put together

171
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:24,610
teach us we want to be on that winning

172
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:27,550
side so when you take those those

173
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,830
spheres of security now today's world

174
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,479
it's no longer you're talking from your

175
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,940
own premise building to the cloud

176
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,520
you are talking hybrid multi cloud where

177
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,599
you're going on premise you're going to

178
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,190
Amazon Web Services you're going to

179
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,810
Google you're going to as your office

180
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,210
365 her rope

181
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,190
Salesforce and then hundreds of

182
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,289
third-party SAS providers that perform

183
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,270
niche operations for your company and

184
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,620
not only that but those communications

185
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,990
now are not happening through a

186
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,850
centralized visible corridor where you

187
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,430
would typically apply your logs or your

188
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,080
span ports and your your Kaz bees and

189
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,780
all this these connections need to

190
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,030
happen cloud the cloud across in

191
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,530
addition to your data center in the

192
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,989
kicker that's not even on this slide are

193
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,059
your users you talk about edge computing

194
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,380
we hear more and more there there is no

195
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,880
you want to put them on the Internet

196
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,979
allow your services and you want to be

197
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,840
secure but your your mobile workforce

198
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:19,240
now no longer is going to be on that

199
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,479
that secured Network and your facility

200
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,000
you add users to your and this is a huge

201
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,700
massive spider web that we have to

202
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,800
secure and we are we are losing in many

203
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:35,650
fronts on this and we need to find

204
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:38,020
solutions how many of your security

205
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,150
programs feel like this where you have

206
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,190
everybody around you the biggest buzz

207
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,260
right now robotic process automation we

208
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,940
need to get faster we want to do all

209
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,770
infrastructure as code when you write

210
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,210
your code you need to write it you put

211
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,490
in github you do a pull request that

212
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,260
goes to your CI CD pipeline and you were

213
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,789
deployed in seconds that's how our

214
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,110
business wants to run that's the speed

215
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:58,330
we have to run to stay ahead of our

216
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,220
competitors you have information

217
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,469
security in there being the manual you

218
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,300
need to meet with here it's the it's the

219
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,400
Ryan and so on so show we need to make

220
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,080
sure either that's not ok that's not how

221
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,419
we need to operate we need to be

222
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,310
data-driven risk driven these decisions

223
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,409
should not be in our heads on making

224
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,910
when when we make a decision based on

225
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,620
risk when you go to your Security

226
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,479
Advisor or somebody and they're making

227
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,160
that they're really doing a data-driven

228
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,570
risk calculation or they're just

229
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,090
guessing one or the other they may not

230
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,370
admit but those thought processes need

231
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,979
to be put to put the code codified there

232
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,870
is no reason we be that manual I mean or

233
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,549
talking point in that step we have to

234
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,229
move because if not they're just gonna

235
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,789
cut us out it's not they're not going to

236
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,469
wait on that barrier forever and we

237
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:40,029
don't have time we have to build that in

238
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,159
and you start thinking about how can we

239
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,920
automate those decisions and at the same

240
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,720
time we talked about how exhausted we

241
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,699
are and how much we're burnt out let's

242
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,230
automate these things let's not repeat

243
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,330
the same thing twice if you have to make

244
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,950
the same decision or you ask the same

245
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,500
questions over and

246
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,720
that's crazy that's not sustainable for

247
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,430
anybody and nobody wants to do that so

248
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,500
let's start put that together I know

249
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,270
when you think about architecture

250
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,160
objectives and how to secure system

251
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,770
typically you ask the same things yes

252
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,290
how do you have malware protection you

253
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,699
have a firewall do you have logins you

254
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,319
you ask the same things over and over

255
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,910
let's just write that down in into your

256
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,410
development team and say you do these

257
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,640
things if you can't do it talk to us

258
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,439
we'll figure out we have a streamline

259
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,870
risk of exception process we'll pass you

260
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,550
through move along and then the risk can

261
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,560
be overtaken by the business they can be

262
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,510
signed off we've effectively quantify it

263
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,609
and we haven't slowed them down that's

264
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:37,060
that's where we need to get to and we

265
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:39,580
need to be effective this has resonated

266
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,010
with me since I've read it and it's

267
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,200
resonated with me because I feel it is

268
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:47,590
completely true and completely accurate

269
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,510
and through actuarial data so insurance

270
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,860
actuaries what they do is they measure

271
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,560
risk you think of insurance companies

272
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,180
they can they they will charge you this

273
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,319
cost and cover you for the cost of

274
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:01,780
floods tornadoes hurricanes water fire

275
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,090
cybersecurity they their business model

276
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,160
revolves around effective risk decisions

277
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:08,860
based on your security posture on your

278
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,569
decisions and we are failing as a

279
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,160
security industry in doing this it's

280
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,350
embarrassing that our insurance

281
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,540
companies the analysts the scientists

282
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,300
the statists that know nothing about

283
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,069
information security can tell you your

284
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,140
organization you have this percentage

285
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,030
chance of getting breached versus this

286
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,290
and you know who the seaso is going to

287
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,430
listen to they're gonna listen to the

288
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,050
insurance companies they're not going to

289
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,640
listen to you as an engineer saying I

290
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,859
need this tool this capability or this

291
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,770
vendor these are going to be analytic

292
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,870
data driven across industry information

293
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,810
that is going to have extensive value

294
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,940
and it's it's sad that we can't display

295
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,589
that effectively as an industry we need

296
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,360
to get better and that's not saying that

297
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,680
we're family but we need to be partners

298
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,570
with the insurance industries the

299
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,310
actuaries we need to learn what are they

300
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,350
doing that we're missing what are they

301
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,390
doing differently maybe we need to bring

302
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,950
that into back into security maybe we

303
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,660
need to bring these scientific processes

304
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,690
something is working for them that's not

305
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,400
working for us what is it

306
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,380
so there's really three major shifts

307
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,319
that I see in mass adoption and this is

308
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:12,530
all driven by data and analytics in that

309
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,420
I work at lily pharmaceuticals so I get

310
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,790
to work with our R&D department pretty

311
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,620
extensively and it's exciting the reason

312
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,930
because I focus on cloud security there

313
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,700
and all the trailblazing projects

314
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,920
everything related is big data is

315
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,110
analytics I always thought it was a big

316
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,150
deal to say that we can process 100

317
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,830
gigabytes through our sim of security

318
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,660
monitoring and we can run a query in

319
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,490
about 45 minutes and tell you somebody's

320
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,530
doing something wrong that's not that's

321
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,720
not great I'm talking to these

322
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,730
scientists they are processing seven

323
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,590
petabytes of data and they need to move

324
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,750
faster and they need to do queries in

325
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,850
real-time because they are finding cures

326
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,040
to causes like cancer and say these are

327
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,560
the big deal things that if they're able

328
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,079
to do this at this scale surely my need

329
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,790
to search 100 gigabytes of logs as

330
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,970
capable as possible and should be

331
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,380
automated what are we missing so I start

332
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,000
asking questions I start learning from

333
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,100
them I want to learn so the first thing

334
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,240
that's happening across the industry and

335
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,040
it's something that every one of us can

336
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,290
get into because it's is extremely

337
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,349
exciting is democratized accessibility

338
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,240
of data there are tons and tons of data

339
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,280
set out there really available that we

340
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,410
have access to in the capabilities the

341
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,199
problem are that these data sets are

342
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,939
terabytes petabytes in size really

343
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,250
available really as searchable we can

344
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,860
use these but we're just on the grass

345
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:30,050
the front of learning how to actually

346
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,780
search these how to apply this in do and

347
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,219
but if I had to recommend how do you get

348
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,319
started how do you start learning these

349
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,210
are the key go to use that I would say

350
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,160
Kaggle is awesome there's so many data

351
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,840
sets that people just omit and do you

352
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,199
can just start learning talking it's

353
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,870
it's an entire area there the AWS public

354
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,610
dataset program s3 buckets have tons of

355
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,500
data and the cool thing about that is

356
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,510
since it's all stored in the same way

357
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,360
you can access it the same set so if

358
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,560
it's one set of data in s3 across you

359
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,030
just need to kind of understand the

360
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,699
schemas the format's and you can tap

361
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:03,439
into that and one of the areas that I

362
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,780
just learned about about two weeks ago

363
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,660
is common crawl and I think it's what 25

364
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,850
billion web pages crawled so think

365
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,350
Google search but Google search you're

366
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,680
like getting websites back and doing

367
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,379
what if you could search the actual HT

368
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,529
you can search the script tags if you

369
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:23,259
can look for thread indicators you can

370
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,939
look for cross-site I mean just think

371
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:27,009
about all the endless things we as

372
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:28,360
either red teamers or blue teamers or

373
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:30,369
hackers or adversaries can take

374
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:35,740
advantage of if we only knew how to

375
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:37,990
search this data the next part is data

376
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,999
gravity we have to move closer to the

377
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,279
data it's now unrealistic to move these

378
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:43,749
datasets once they land somewhere we

379
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,790
have to build the computer around it and

380
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:48,009
that's a big driver to why there's so

381
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,019
much hybrid cloud and why you have to

382
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:52,240
use Amazon Web Services your company has

383
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:54,519
to use Google and Azure there are key

384
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,990
capabilities being advanced on whether

385
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,309
it's machine learning or natural

386
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,529
language processing or advanced

387
00:13:57,309 --> 00:14:01,118
analytics that may be from a security

388
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:03,100
perspective you don't see the value but

389
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,660
the business when you're looking and

390
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,040
putting these together these are the

391
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,660
groundbreaking things that are gonna put

392
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,790
your company's company advantage they're

393
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,290
gonna drive that's the business reason

394
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,969
we have to get around it we have to

395
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:16,420
rally with them and we have to help them

396
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,249
be able to secure and build operate and

397
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,929
compute and move that closer to these

398
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:22,589
data sets because data is gravity and

399
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:22,589
it's not moving

400
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:28,240
so here yet the third part is its

401
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,069
financially viable now I'm going to show

402
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,329
you in a few minutes of demonstration I

403
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,949
don't have internet acces so we're going

404
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:35,829
to kind of pretend on a couple clicks on

405
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:38,319
this but basically in about three hours

406
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:40,479
one evening I was able to sit at home

407
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:42,759
thinking about what do what would be

408
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,149
really cool to show and do well using

409
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:48,370
these data sets third of breed rabbits

410
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:51,429
oven has products owner I know HT Moore

411
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,660
created quite a few years back and it's

412
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:54,699
out there and what it does is it just

413
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,829
searched mean crawls the entire internet

414
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:59,889
gets finger earth footprints all the

415
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:02,859
different services he has all of the DNS

416
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:05,199
into datasets sitting on s3 and Amazon

417
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,639
so who here does bug bounties does

418
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,799
anybody do bug bounties or anything like

419
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,809
that application security who does

420
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:16,779
reconnaissance all right what well I

421
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:19,118
hate being noisy so I don't like to plug

422
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,399
away brute force I've never been a big

423
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:23,620
fan of brute forcing anything so some of

424
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,629
these tools that used a mass if you've

425
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,920
used I'm thorough buster your brute

426
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,060
forcing directors trying to figure out

427
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,550
what's there what's up there

428
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,939
directory's why do that when we have

429
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,589
Wallace running every nights searching

430
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,690
the entire internet collecting that data

431
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,860
for us we don't have to be noisy anymore

432
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,330
we don't have the brute force we don't

433
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,890
have to guess all we have to do is

434
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,350
search there data set that's really

435
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,760
available wide open and so I sat in

436
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:50,050
about three hours put something together

437
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:53,770
and it's there's about 2.9 billion

438
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:56,410
objects in that data set of just DNS all

439
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:59,370
records and you can search that for any

440
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:03,490
domain that you want in it takes about

441
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:07,180
two to five seconds and it costs me

442
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,310
about two to four cents and so I don't

443
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,050
have to hardly spend any money and I

444
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,280
have the capabilities that five years

445
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,719
ago we were investing millions of

446
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,089
dollars in compute infrastructure and

447
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,890
doing and it's just because I've learned

448
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,960
from other people I figured out the how

449
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,970
some people are doing this I put it

450
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,500
together and I've done it and I'm gonna

451
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,940
share this at the completion there's

452
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,440
talk all of this that I talked about is

453
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,970
gonna be out on github fully available

454
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,620
so you can pull it you can learn from it

455
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,540
and that's what I want to just pull

456
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,220
these examples figure out how can I

457
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,780
apply this to my business to what I'm

458
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:39,280
doing so let's get started this is

459
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,720
another quote that I like and we're not

460
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,209
going to get in the weeds on machine

461
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,760
learning in all this but this is true I

462
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,670
I missed a lot of the early hacker scene

463
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,230
I loved reading about it the the CDC

464
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,689
book that just came out is awesome it's

465
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,220
it's a good read it's there's so much to

466
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,570
learn but we're on the foreground we're

467
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,700
on the ground breaking these things that

468
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,440
we do today are going to be the things

469
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,970
that our kids in the next generation of

470
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,190
security are going to talk about and we

471
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:09,880
are we are leading this way let's pave

472
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:12,340
it let's do some cool stuff so the first

473
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,260
thing that I did at work was as we moved

474
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,909
our datasets one of the things was we'll

475
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,920
Ryan we feel like we're gonna have to

476
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,560
move our jupiter notebooks to the cloud

477
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,440
i'm thinking jupiter notebook i've never

478
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,659
heard of it but i guess i'm picture i'm

479
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,340
picturing like this really rugged laptop

480
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,690
that could probably survive on jupiter

481
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,800
that's the wrong thing and so i'm going

482
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,870
through your while you're using our

483
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,270
standard image you're what are you doing

484
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:37,260
about patch management like no Ryan no

485
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:41,920
no this this is a software based web

486
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:44,080
webpage driven so what it is is a basic

487
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,150
you see if the next slide has a little

488
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,220
more detail yeah so Jupiter notebooks

489
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,050
are actually you picture OneNote but it

490
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,030
runs in a web page so you can you can

491
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,940
host it you can run it locally you can

492
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:56,410
do and it supports all the it supports

493
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,960
over 40 programming languages now the

494
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,600
primary's being uses usually here Python

495
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,930
and are heavily used by on the

496
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,879
scientific community computing community

497
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,200
but um so I start I continue that's

498
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,010
questions if you want to move this to

499
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,990
the cloud whoa

500
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,090
tell me a little bit more like in the

501
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,770
guys saying well it's really not that

502
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,290
big a deal it's probably not that much

503
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:19,060
of a security risk all right so so I

504
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,860
know that your on-premise infrastructure

505
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,389
you need to move because a thousand

506
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,639
distributed floors isn't enough this

507
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,480
your interface into it tell me more so

508
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,250
what's it do

509
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,200
well you can write code you can write

510
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,360
Python against it so you're pretty much

511
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,310
self-contained limited all right all

512
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,629
right tell me more do you have it do you

513
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,220
have access to the operating systems

514
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,400
behind it knowing that you want to go

515
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,930
from a thousand core limitations to

516
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,400
unlimited confusion Amazon well well

517
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,110
yeah actually we can run operating

518
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,850
system commands you can do whatever you

519
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,709
can through a Python interface I'm

520
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,149
thinking all right all right you're

521
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,730
probably this probably isn't a security

522
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,740
big deal thing but go on you just

523
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,540
confirmed that you have full hosts

524
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,200
underlying host capabilities to do

525
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,870
whatever you want

526
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,040
hi to our network running Python on top

527
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,399
no big deal

528
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,570
tell me more and so and so we go in and

529
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,190
I'm basically it ends up in a

530
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,169
conversation well I think I need access

531
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:11,290
to this to dig in a little bit more you

532
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,820
know what I mean so so they so we we

533
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,730
secured a and got it all working but

534
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,889
it's crazy that I I did not ever hear

535
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,380
about Jupiter notebooks in 12 years of

536
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,510
security until the past year and I have

537
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,040
been missing out it is it is the coolest

538
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,080
thing ever if you're trying to break its

539
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,940
code or scripts and you I'm gonna show

540
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,560
you some demos and why why it's so neat

541
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,570
but it's something that I recommend even

542
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,950
if even if you're not in a technical

543
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,230
role the things that you can show the

544
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,880
demonstrate of just so little lines of

545
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,350
code just learning the few different

546
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,270
things you can put you front and center

547
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,969
of answering some of the toughest

548
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:45,370
questions that you want so this is what

549
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,980
a typical data scientist library looks

550
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,229
like they if you had to pick any tools

551
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,130
they're pretty much everything pretty

552
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,140
much revolves around the matplotlib and

553
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,360
numpy so that

554
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,520
doing mathematical calculations data

555
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,260
analytics it can it can do it at scale

556
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,639
you have you have some of the leading

557
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,590
scientists writing this so they're

558
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,290
they're absolutely optimizing it this

559
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,580
runs fast and then you have some key

560
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,850
things where you can do cool

561
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,889
visualizations with okay and they're

562
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,659
Seabourn and those are some of the ways

563
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,750
that you can actually visualize data and

564
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,520
then I asked on the corner so what a lot

565
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,260
of Jupiter does some of the limitations

566
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,629
are it runs in everything in memory so

567
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,129
it's extremely fast but your memory

568
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,919
constrained so let's say I'm running it

569
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,500
from my 16 gig laptop of memory then I'm

570
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,850
a memory constrained so I want to maybe

571
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,890
I'm doing a process in a big data set

572
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,199
well you can use the desk library

573
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,090
distribute that across as many computes

574
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,370
as you want so I was going to actually

575
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:43,620
demonstrate an example using basket but

576
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,149
I didn't I couldn't because the space on

577
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,760
my laptop is actually less than the

578
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,220
amount of memory I have so I couldn't do

579
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,669
it good I could have done it but either

580
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,080
way it gives you the ability to leverage

581
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,700
distributed computing in just a single

582
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,460
library that you can run from your local

583
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,630
laptop so we're going to go ahead and

584
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,290
jump into and who here likes to tell

585
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,030
stories

586
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,440
everybody insecurities likes to tell

587
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,790
stories that's why we come to Derby on

588
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,470
other places everywhere you go I was

589
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,330
sitting Yazoo and I heard about 10

590
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,830
different stories around me all of

591
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,168
security related with different things

592
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,340
we love to tell stories but we need to

593
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:18,750
get better at it we need to say the

594
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,309
things that are going to give values for

595
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,320
our executives to our leadership to our

596
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:24,090
stakeholders or shareholders these are

597
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,830
too neat visualizations that have been

598
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,120
done out of these libraries these are

599
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,668
actually done about five or six years

600
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,439
ago these are dependency trees of Python

601
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:33,690
libraries so if you think python compute

602
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,520
everything mapped together that's what

603
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,200
that looks like in that ecosystem but to

604
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,990
build a tell a story visualization that

605
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:45,150
helps us but what it really comes down

606
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,309
to what I found that helps the most of

607
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,809
getting value out of everything we do is

608
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:51,360
going to our third grade science class

609
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:53,220
it's the it's the scientific method that

610
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,428
we thought we would never use in real

611
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,230
life ever until until I've started to

612
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:00,480
apply this and think through information

613
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:02,429
security on where we failed where have

614
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,470
we missed the boat well if you look the

615
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:06,090
scientific method that we all learned

616
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,490
about it's been around since the 17th

617
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,889
century start by asking a question what

618
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,690
do we want

619
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,880
to solve before you go buy that piece of

620
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,710
software that talk to that vendor think

621
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,270
about what's the question what are we

622
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,800
trying to solve and let's do a little

623
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,900
background research on our own see if

624
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,850
we're on the right path and then you

625
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,650
construct the hypothesis everybody that

626
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,169
I work with in research and development

627
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,330
the scientists the statists everything

628
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,740
is my hypothesis is this I think this is

629
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,629
going to happen this is my prediction

630
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,370
and then they continue to build those

631
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,930
test cases they experiment they work

632
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,969
through it and if it doesn't match their

633
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,680
hypothesis that's not work last that's

634
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,990
not throwaway work that is investment

635
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,370
for the future ideas future benefit that

636
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,710
they share with other scientists other

637
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,350
people you don't do enough of that in

638
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,970
security we we think about well we've

639
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,800
heard that this is going to stop use the

640
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,360
taxis intruders let's do this

641
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,980
well let's think about the why let's

642
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,990
start walking through the scientific

643
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,970
method and then once you get there a lot

644
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,680
of times we stop at all right this seems

645
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,960
to work but how we actually analyze the

646
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,030
data have we processed it and then you

647
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,860
build the visualizations you confirm

648
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,810
your hypothesis or you show that it

649
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,729
needs more value and then the last thing

650
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,860
is communicate the results we are bad at

651
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,480
communicating as security professionals

652
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,770
we need to get better and that's the

653
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,940
follow-through that's the commitment

654
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,340
that's showing that we bought this

655
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,710
product this tool this capability made

656
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,090
this investment here's here's why it

657
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,090
works here's how it works

658
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,770
and here's how you hopefully about

659
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,409
leveraging that communicate results

660
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,300
I don't like paper I would say this

661
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,160
communicators all should be codified it

662
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,990
should be I can inject this into your

663
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,060
pipeline I can get this into your

664
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,650
process you are baking you were doing

665
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,629
that embedded security you walk through

666
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,430
this you show that value you will win

667
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,640
over teams every single time and be much

668
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,230
more successful so it starts with asking

669
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,900
the right question so as we jump into

670
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,760
some demos here I want to start off with

671
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,040
there's there's three different

672
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,570
questions that one solution solves it's

673
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,280
just we have to think through how do we

674
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:59,200
say those same things so the first one

675
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,149
is I'm an adversary how can I perform

676
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,620
read passive reconnaissance without

677
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,270
actually touching the target I don't

678
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,370
want to know them know that I'm even

679
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,780
interested I want to just show up under

680
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,909
the radar I don't even want to be on the

681
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,220
radar so that's that's one question and

682
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,480
then you talk to your seaso to see so

683
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,190
may want to know what does their

684
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,420
external attack surface look like what

685
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,910
do we look like to our adversaries are

686
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,240
red team same type of question but

687
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:22,570
different in mission intent and then you

688
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,850
talked

689
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,990
you see CEO they want to know what does

690
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,519
our company look like through the

691
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,169
outside world what are our shareholders

692
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,299
looking at what are investors looking at

693
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:35,259
what are our cyber insurers looking at

694
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:37,480
from from a hygiene standpoint so what I

695
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:39,070
didn't realize is security risk advisors

696
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,539
are actually sitting out of the door on

697
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,860
one of the vendors so I'm talking a lot

698
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:43,240
about not buying into vendors the

699
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,519
different things but they have they

700
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,950
actually part of this that I'm going to

701
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,409
demonstrate here is the one of their

702
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:53,019
guys wrote a really cool blog on setting

703
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:54,940
up using EWS services and you can you

704
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:56,889
basically set up an API gateway so it's

705
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:00,190
an API that runs and it uses two

706
00:24:56,889 --> 00:25:02,408
services called ena and glue and Athena

707
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,629
is ability it's like sequel language

708
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:05,950
where you can search s3 fig data all

709
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:07,418
these data sets they're out there in the

710
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,519
internet you can write queries against

711
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:11,769
and then flu actually is more the index

712
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,029
the hides where you can then do it so

713
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:15,580
you don't have to over and over search

714
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:17,769
that data set every single time so those

715
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:23,678
are two key things and that's the that's

716
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:25,809
kind of because of this work that

717
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,269
they've done that's why I'm able to run

718
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:31,480
queries against large massive data sets

719
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:34,360
for pennies on the dollar and in very

720
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,769
short period of time so I'm gonna jump

721
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,610
on over this is this is what I was

722
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:38,470
trying to figure out before my

723
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,850
presentation is I can't see the screen

724
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,899
from standing here so we're gonna I

725
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,879
don't know if the sound guys are gonna

726
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:44,439
like it but I might walk over to my to

727
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:46,090
my screen I'm gonna switch out all right

728
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,740
they're giving me the thumbs up so we're

729
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,939
gonna we're gonna do some quick

730
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,309
switching here and we're just gonna walk

731
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,110
through the examples and kind of

732
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:56,879
demonstrate what we can do but let me

733
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,879
let me go back here are you able to see

734
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:00,789
will show these first actually and I'll

735
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:04,120
show the code but what you're seeing on

736
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:06,370
the screen here are this is what I can

737
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,830
run in about two to four seconds against

738
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:12,039
whatever domain name that I want using

739
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:14,168
the Qualis the sonar products on our DNS

740
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:16,090
records so I can I can produce a heat

741
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:18,250
map all of this end-to-end it takes

742
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:20,470
about 30 seconds that's because it takes

743
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,480
it takes a couple seconds for the s3

744
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,980
object to download so I have asleep for

745
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,779
30 seconds in my code so that's probably

746
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,850
really the only reason but this is a

747
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:31,149
heat map of I believe this is Apple comm

748
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,428
so this I can run completely passive not

749
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:35,080
touching Apple whatsoever anything of

750
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:36,190
their system here leaves and open data

751
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,289
sets I can

752
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:40,600
run this and have this result fully

753
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:41,289
generated under 30 seconds or whatever

754
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,299
domain

755
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:44,590
I want across the Internet and you show

756
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,029
this your executives this is what our

757
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,889
external presence looks like of all of

758
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:50,769
our web sites where it's hosted based on

759
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:52,658
IP lat longitude in doing so it's it's

760
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:54,159
pretty neat and to be able to go through

761
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:55,450
there I mean just looking at some of the

762
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,769
biggest tech companies the world does

763
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,700
anybody have any ideas what does this

764
00:26:56,769 --> 00:27:01,779
look like this is this is Facebook what

765
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,759
they look like from an external

766
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:08,710
perspective facebook.com/ and all

767
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:10,360
subdomains underneath this one yeah I

768
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,100
think the first yeah this one is

769
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,469
Microsoft I believe they have a hundred

770
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:17,559
and seventy thousand a records

771
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:19,269
underneath start Microsoft com this is

772
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:22,990
their heat map of what their external

773
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:24,309
presence looks like and then here I

774
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,600
thought this one was pretty interesting

775
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,769
Amazon so I'm gonna pull it back and

776
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,080
forth a couple times but they actually

777
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:31,090
don't look much different than Microsoft

778
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,740
that also I feel like from a cloud

779
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,799
provider standpoint they're following

780
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:39,730
very similar thought process but you see

781
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:41,259
that map barely change this is Alibaba

782
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,139
cloud I thought well let's let's try

783
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:45,610
some some other ones from non us-based

784
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:47,879
companies and so this one kind of

785
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,928
demonstrates that in their layout

786
00:27:47,879 --> 00:28:00,158
anybody have any guess as to what this

787
00:27:49,929 --> 00:28:02,110
is derbycon calm if you notice you could

788
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,580
get an early peek at the CTF scoreboard

789
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,049
that's been out there for a little while

790
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,730
now so if you were wondering what it

791
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:08,408
looked like I was I thought it'd be

792
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,850
pretty cool to get myself registered

793
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:11,500
ahead of time on there it was only a

794
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,730
public you I think Scott way down there

795
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,409
and Rob's time and they're doing a great

796
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,509
job and they locked it down properly but

797
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:18,669
this is this is just a quick example of

798
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:20,830
what you can what you can do all under

799
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:22,330
microseconds not touching anybody's

800
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,250
company and not doing anything but just

801
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,529
all that fall off of freely public

802
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:28,389
information you start thinking this from

803
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:30,159
an adversarial perspective I have this

804
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:31,600
information I have the data since I had

805
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,970
the latitude/longitude I have the C

806
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,559
names we as if you're doing bug bounties

807
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,809
or enumeration or you're just trying to

808
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:40,389
profile a company you spend hours and

809
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:41,678
hours trying to enumerate the domain and

810
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:42,789
guess what do they have you're doing

811
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,799
Google hack you're doing all these

812
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:47,679
sources certificate transparency checks

813
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,850
why not just use this and you have I

814
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,220
think Microsoft yeah I said 107

815
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,659
eight thousand so pretty neat but you

816
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,950
can start applying this concept to other

817
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,929
things if anybody's ever run a

818
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:00,559
certificate transparency report any time

819
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:01,850
you have a publicly exposed certificate

820
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,530
that you get from a polling company it's

821
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,389
it's in a transparency report so you can

822
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:07,940
run it you can figure out what it what

823
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,559
is my company look like doing one of the

824
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,240
one of the guys Justin Bollinger

825
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,740
actually wrote a script that will parse

826
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,480
the data but I took it a step further

827
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,190
and then started to use the geo Minds

828
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,660
the IP map you just that use some key

829
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:22,909
maps for examples some program value so

830
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,470
we've talked a lot about IP map and I

831
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:26,240
don't want it to all be about heat maps

832
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,159
but this is an area that I use

833
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,679
internally where as we build application

834
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,030
security programs it doesn't have to be

835
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:34,250
a big data sets that you can use these

836
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:36,740
concepts with this is just a snapshot of

837
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,179
the spreadsheet that I can maintain from

838
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,190
the program standpoint I want to look at

839
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:41,720
my current where I'm at today I want to

840
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,490
look at the future I saved that

841
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,980
spreadsheet in one location always point

842
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,679
my code to it in with the click of a go

843
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,840
I have updated metrics that I can

844
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,970
publish out save it publish directly to

845
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,459
an HTML site a dashboard a screen a

846
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,809
monitoring your area of how the program

847
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,460
is doing how its maturing you think

848
00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:00,020
about being able to just do that with

849
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,700
every one of your spreadsheets that you

850
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,440
maintain manually or you do these

851
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,049
transforms let's just do it by a couple

852
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,490
lines of code you can build really neat

853
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:09,230
programs where you're demonstrating

854
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,270
about day to day continuous value to

855
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,970
your executives to your leadership you

856
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:16,429
can build justification on why you may

857
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,020
need some different things so here's

858
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:19,340
another here's another cool and that I

859
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,840
thought was just kind of neat and this

860
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,250
is the intent of this is really just to

861
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,449
get your mind going thinking about all

862
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:25,340
the different things you could you could

863
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,260
leverage these for so if you think about

864
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,490
why are we so busy over the holidays

865
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,990
your patch management you might be

866
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,850
asking that or at what times do we need

867
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,590
to increase our staff being the security

868
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:35,360
manager or the cease token why do our

869
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:38,000
vulnerability counts always increase

870
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,250
well I thought let's look look at the

871
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,990
CVE 8cv data database where you can

872
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,870
actually download the past twenty years

873
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,340
of all the CDs published and let's run

874
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:50,750
some analytics off of this so you can

875
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:53,449
see from 1999 to 2019 I mean how much

876
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:55,159
year over year that the CDs have been

877
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,750
published these are your vulnerabilities

878
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,059
and products that you typically would

879
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,799
get patches for her receive now it

880
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:02,090
doesn't mean that these this number of

881
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,090
vulnerabilities have always existed but

882
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,260
these are the known

883
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,030
ability so more and more being

884
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,980
discovered more and more companies are

885
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,180
recognizing that leveraging CV but you

886
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,280
can just see the year-over-year growth

887
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,110
of this is becoming a bigger deal this

888
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,550
is why we have to year-over-year spend

889
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,469
more on patch management or it's a

890
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,240
bigger deal or why are trends these are

891
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,340
the stories that we need to tell behind

892
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,230
the data the value and it just

893
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,929
continually expands over the program

894
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,880
this is what we've missed as an industry

895
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,740
I feel like at least I have personally

896
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,090
over the past 10 years that I could have

897
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:35,490
been tapping into you telling the story

898
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:38,370
over and over again so there's some the

899
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:40,470
challenges to solve I think this helps

900
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,790
with our competition for talent first

901
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,740
off it increases it because if you learn

902
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:46,260
this you become more you become more

903
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,710
valuable to the industry but also we

904
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:51,450
have constant I mean see so tenure is 24

905
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,460
to 48 months across companies it's hard

906
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,380
to build a mature program when your

907
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,510
leadership is leaving continually and

908
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,010
then you also look at how many times

909
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,960
that you re kick-started the same

910
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,460
process we're doing this new technology

911
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,260
why haven't we been building

912
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,180
year-over-year on top of this how do we

913
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,129
lose this continuity if you start doing

914
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,540
with the Jupiter notebooks building

915
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,190
codifying of what you're doing building

916
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,990
these metrics that makes it a lot easier

917
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,790
that you don't take steps back every

918
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,440
single time you lose key resources that

919
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,210
knowledge is there it's continuous and

920
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,390
then your new team members can just do

921
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:23,190
team to build on that in eight or eight

922
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,750
the next start of the program continuity

923
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,190
which I just hit on based on that the

924
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,690
program continuity is we don't want to

925
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,460
lose the knowledge every single time

926
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,530
somebody good from our teams lose or

927
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,240
leave let's let's have them start to

928
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,910
work publish their information let's

929
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,030
drive metrics let's be a data-driven

930
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:40,770
program and then the third one is the

931
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,540
continuous risk measurement we need to

932
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:43,920
do everything based on risk that's how

933
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,409
our business does that's how they

934
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,240
operate there is no reason now that we

935
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:50,880
should just say no for know we have to

936
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,530
be driven based on risk and then

937
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,910
sometimes risks are worth taking

938
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,379
there's always business value there's

939
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,240
money to be made we don't have a

940
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,190
security program if the business isn't

941
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,660
making money we have to weigh that and

942
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,850
we work with the business partner with

943
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,350
them and learn what makes what's the

944
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:07,230
value there where is that and let's

945
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,490
working partners together with them and

946
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,770
I'm not actually done with the

947
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,240
presentation sorry I hope it's beginning

948
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:14,850
but I thought since I have to do a

949
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,760
couple screen swaps for this I'm gonna

950
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:18,740
I'm gonna show you a couple of demos

951
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,600
now what what all these tools look like

952
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,270
because it's pretty fascinating just to

953
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:28,490
see how limited effort you have to put

954
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:31,250
in to get this extensive value all right

955
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:34,190
I'm gonna walk over here real fast so we

956
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:37,520
will be interesting the point through so

957
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:40,100
this is the example on the yeah this is

958
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,809
the the Google map or the Google Maps of

959
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,610
running the queries against the big data

960
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:45,168
but you can kind of see as that I'm

961
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,490
gonna actually just extend my monitor so

962
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:48,770
you can see them both and then I can

963
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:53,450
just walk through right here see if it's

964
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:55,429
work all right

965
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,660
so it up there all right perfect so as

966
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:58,880
you walk through this this is just

967
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,580
calling my the top part is calling my

968
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,549
AWS API but literally what is this like

969
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:07,220
ten lines of code and then I'm querying

970
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:08,899
back here's the Microsoft example you

971
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,490
get your cname your a records so even

972
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:11,929
though I'm doing a heatmap you can see

973
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:13,279
all the additional information that I

974
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:15,080
pull back and this is what's neat too is

975
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,879
you don't have to be a pro developer you

976
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,619
just work bits and pieces so you can see

977
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,270
what parts of your code are working you

978
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:21,619
can quickly look at variables quickly

979
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,899
look what's what's my data look like

980
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:25,629
step by step using this so you walk

981
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:28,100
through this you see that I have this

982
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:28,790
output so what I want to what do I want

983
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,399
to do with it

984
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:34,040
I want to go ahead down user style plate

985
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:35,449
so on a load you can actually load new

986
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,279
jupiter notebooks so what i'm running

987
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,989
this is that web jupiter notebook that i

988
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,730
talked about earlier i can call

989
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:42,618
different ones so in order to draw these

990
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,240
heat maps I don't want to recreate the

991
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:46,250
wheel 100 times we're talking about not

992
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,629
doing that's what I do is I create a

993
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,550
notebook that actually just has a

994
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,219
function and all it does is it receives

995
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,379
DF posts in there which is my variable

996
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,330
so that's my data frame so I'm passing

997
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:58,009
it this big frame of all the data I just

998
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,080
collected it can have a hundred columns

999
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,180
a million rows it doesn't matter I wrote

1000
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,859
it so be interoperable and then all I

1001
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,680
have to do is pass that function to tell

1002
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:08,690
which column has the IP address in there

1003
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,250
and so as long as I can normalize

1004
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,109
whatever data from any to whether you

1005
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,090
use nmap you do scans port scans

1006
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:15,770
anything as long as you put it into a

1007
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,900
data frame which is about three lines of

1008
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,609
code and then you tell it what column

1009
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,560
I'm gonna share this code out that you

1010
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:22,730
do you pass it you can do heat maps you

1011
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,619
do whatever you want off of it and

1012
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,300
continue the process and the goal is

1013
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:30,770
just to iterate over it so as

1014
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:32,330
reusable functional as possible and then

1015
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:34,250
you do you can build some counts so you

1016
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,569
can see how many different places the

1017
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,740
different latitudes blonds receive so

1018
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,150
this is just step by step because I

1019
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,009
think it's hard to write programs that

1020
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:42,080
are extensive before you see but just

1021
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,910
the the speed at which you can work and

1022
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,870
iterate over four lines of code just to

1023
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,399
make sure you have it right and

1024
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,890
operating it's it's just I think it's

1025
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,360
really neat it does in-line heat map so

1026
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,250
you can save it this is Google Maps I

1027
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,110
can switch the satellite view you can

1028
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,580
zoom in I mean this is since I'm not

1029
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:58,070
connect to the internet it just lost the

1030
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,330
picture but everything you do within a

1031
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,730
live Google Maps it's real-time

1032
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,960
streaming processing taught talking out

1033
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:05,030
you can do all this within a lab

1034
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,290
notebook so if you picture what science

1035
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,790
and the future is gonna look like your

1036
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,170
white papers are no longer in the V

1037
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,000
these academic white papers you're

1038
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,740
reading you are hopefully reading

1039
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,240
Jupiter notebooks and similar type

1040
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:17,089
things where it shows the actual

1041
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,339
algorithms being used analysis and it's

1042
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,950
repeatable this next time you read a

1043
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,750
research paper that has calculations and

1044
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,100
things in it they should be delivering

1045
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,020
and using these notebooks because then

1046
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,779
anybody can bet it they can go through

1047
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,009
you can validate actually proof

1048
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,330
scientific proof that these are running

1049
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,700
their living breathing you can iterate

1050
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:36,860
on top of these other research build in

1051
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,779
the community so you deliver this and

1052
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,460
also it maintains integrity it maintains

1053
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,710
the Lydia you can version control it you

1054
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,090
can see how things go this is this is

1055
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,740
where science is heading and I think

1056
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:48,260
it's really neat but I think information

1057
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,479
plays such a massive role and just leaps

1058
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,610
and bounds and being with you that so

1059
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,930
that's that's just the one example there

1060
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,100
I'm not going to go much further but

1061
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:57,620
what I'm going to share out here's the

1062
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:01,520
certificate transparency code that we

1063
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:04,069
can we can do in it you go through and

1064
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,690
it does a lot of the same steps the the

1065
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,580
beast and so what I'm doing is this is

1066
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,530
the application security measurement one

1067
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,240
visa all I do is I pulling it excels

1068
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,910
breed I mean how much easier does it get

1069
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,770
then pandas which is the data frame tool

1070
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,270
I'm gonna read underscore excel and I

1071
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,740
just passed it in it automatically

1072
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,000
figures out the columns you want to use

1073
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,220
and you figure out which ones you want

1074
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,110
and do I mean what's this four lines of

1075
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,490
code and I'm now just imported and Excel

1076
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,140
spreadsheet into a data frame that I

1077
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,540
could do any analytics that I want on it

1078
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,910
pretty neat

1079
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,650
[Music]

1080
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,120
this is why I like to stay up at night I

1081
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,130
mean just think of all the things that

1082
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,890
you could do with this so I mean all in

1083
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:41,650
line can do that I'll share that here's

1084
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,210
the CBE code it took a couple I had to

1085
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,260
do a little data validation there

1086
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,000
because they don't actually give you a

1087
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,510
creation date but you can work through

1088
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,340
it you show it here's what is this

1089
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:53,110
150,000 CVEs you can process all within

1090
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,510
this few lines of code you can doing

1091
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:58,810
analytics see so I walked through I want

1092
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:00,550
to do the calendars by year here's

1093
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,890
here's what the actual data looks like

1094
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,810
in there and then what I like to do too

1095
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,460
is I don't like to manipulate anything

1096
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,020
before it so whatever source you get

1097
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,250
it's you can download directly off their

1098
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,930
website you could actually do a double

1099
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,640
you get at the top just so you're always

1100
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:14,560
pulling the most recent data rather than

1101
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,089
saving it locally but don't change don't

1102
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,980
modify the data because you're going to

1103
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,900
do iterative work figure out how you

1104
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,310
download it that exact format work with

1105
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,230
that because you can and then you don't

1106
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,580
have to do anything just literally click

1107
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:27,510
through and you could pull all this into

1108
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,790
one you do it but so there's that one

1109
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:32,110
and then the bouquet plot that I showed

1110
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:34,600
with the Seavey's you can actually

1111
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:37,030
applied it to a HTML page and you can

1112
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,620
run full Jupiter notebooks out of there

1113
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,060
so one of the things I would say just to

1114
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,279
get started there's a tool called

1115
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:44,200
anaconda and it has Jupiter built in so

1116
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,780
you just out you go downloading anaconda

1117
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,089
it's free open source and you click one

1118
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,530
button it'll start up at Jupiter running

1119
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,260
notebook that you saw it runs locally

1120
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,970
and start start iterating start learning

1121
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,610
and I hope this gives you some nuggets

1122
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:59,140
to expand on and I will tweet out the

1123
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,150
link to the github once I get it cleaned

1124
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,529
up and posted later this weekend so keep

1125
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:05,400
an eye out for that I appreciate

1126
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,400
everyone coming thank you

1127
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:13,160
[Applause]

1128
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,350
we have a couple minutes for questions

1129
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,549
so feel free I have a couple minutes or

1130
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:33,140
if you need you can come up and talk to

1131
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:34,430
me after thank you yeah so the question

1132
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,620
is how did I secure some of these public

1133
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:38,029
instances I mean it alive it actually

1134
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,799
comes down to securing a website so it's

1135
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,360
access management access control if

1136
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,940
you're if you're doing internet exposed

1137
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,380
multi-factor authentication doing you

1138
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,090
look at least privileged so when you if

1139
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,110
you're are going to be running locally

1140
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,910
on the hosts you want to make sure

1141
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,740
you're running as least privilege you

1142
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,690
need to do user profiles so you can't

1143
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,370
cross pollinate across different wines I

1144
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:57,230
mean there's there's you look at it from

1145
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:59,120
layers but it's very similar to securing

1146
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:01,280
a typical webpage looking there's

1147
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,779
there's nothing real creative fancy

1148
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,860
about it other than just make it really

1149
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,970
difficult good question

1150
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:12,920
all right well thank you everyone

1151
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:17,919
oh yes question back I will I will

1152
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,920
absolutely all right

1153
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:27,339
there you go app

1154
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:27,339
at Ryan Elkins yes another question

1155
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:37,170
this is all everything I just showed you

1156
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:38,670
and that look is running locally and in

1157
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,979
some of the calls like the API the

1158
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:43,529
Google Maps call that's all cloud based

1159
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:45,808
typically using mostly free to each year

1160
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:47,609
so I think this month I've done hundreds

1161
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:49,799
of queries and requests and I've spent

1162
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:55,339
about five dollars so it's very

1163
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:55,339
affordable all right thank you
