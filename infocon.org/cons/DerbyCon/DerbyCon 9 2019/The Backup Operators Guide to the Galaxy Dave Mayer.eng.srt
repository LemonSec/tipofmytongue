00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:33,170
hi everyone foreign Guardians on the

4
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,150
head of my team operations and also

5
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,220
senior security consultant I've been

6
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,800
specializing now for a few years in red

7
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,540
teaming and investing previously I used

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,989
to work with in health care and

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,050
financial industries and too many

10
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,218
circuits there the list but feel free

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,250
[Music]

12
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,989
so why am i doing this talk a little

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,079
over a year ago I will just working on a

14
00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:02,809
pen test thinnest Network segment where

15
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:05,210
I only had four four four five I was

16
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:07,908
able to do some those sessions on the DC

17
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:10,130
couple the users for the domain and I

18
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:12,259
actually only account I recovered was a

19
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:17,600
backup operators account which had

20
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:20,690
backed up operations so that's how I got

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,280
to where I was once I actually got there

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,560
what I did is I actually planned set up

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,880
my own lab i simulating the same thing

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,520
to figure out how I could use the backup

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,810
operators account to do some damage

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,850
against the domain controller what I

27
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,280
could do

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,020
so a little bit of history for my

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,819
experience most organizations usually

30
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,039
have at least one account backup

31
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:42,909
operators if not more I've seen as many

32
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:46,399
as twenty or thirty and when I ask why

33
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:48,950
no usually it accounts been around for

34
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,479
quite some time and password usually

35
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,020
haven't gotten changed since the account

36
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,429
actually activated scene accounts get

37
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,190
migrated from one backup solution to

38
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:59,720
another no password changed everything

39
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:04,610
still around sometimes even the old

40
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:10,429
banking system so number of systems

41
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:13,730
across that entire domain not just it's

42
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:16,580
a little bit of history of directory and

43
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,099
backup operators can override security

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,640
restrictions on vials for backing up and

45
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,160
restoring files something you need to do

46
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:29,799
some of the things you can't do what I

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,270
was trying to do was actually that sort

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,560
of the basis of this talk that I was

49
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,510
trying to do everything over the network

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,910
without physically going to machine if I

51
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,799
could so don't have remote desktop

52
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,900
access with a little over the back of

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,520
operator count no local admin

54
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,620
permissions on the system and you can't

55
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,240
launch processes from over the net so I

56
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,660
sort of stuck at this point thank you a

57
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,100
lot to do anything else so I went and

58
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,079
start digging in for what I was allowed

59
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,609
to do you can log on loosely at the

60
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,430
console if you're lovely of the system

61
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,709
log on it's batch job on the system shut

62
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,989
it down where you can backup for files

63
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:13,720
and directories honestly that's what

64
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:16,090
things are getting a little and from a

65
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,010
high integrity session the command

66
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,070
prompt you can pack files from the

67
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,079
system I started the band prompted and

68
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,820
you running as with men only do it from

69
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,070
across the network nice and says login

70
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,959
as another user and you can either copy

71
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,720
single files from domain controller

72
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,340
using robocopy and the /b flag there is

73
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,750
what's important that book it actually

74
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,060
gives you the back you can also copy

75
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,560
entire directory slash evil also copy

76
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,480
directories they don't actually have any

77
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,209
files in there you can do slash s but

78
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,579
popular empty folders on the version

79
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:52,350
system

80
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:58,069
so little video here

81
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:58,069
[Music]

82
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:11,940
and start up a command prompt now I'm

83
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:17,219
gonna use the backup right there oMG

84
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:20,579
backup be that easy we're now running

85
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,989
across the network through the back so

86
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,389
now I'm actually going to use robocopy

87
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:27,109
to go on top T now policy from one of

88
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:29,760
the domain controllers put in the path

89
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,980
you can't also put in the domain name

90
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,240
there and copy from it I was working in

91
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,100
just on targeting the one domain

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,990
controller to see how things replicated

93
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:44,970
when I was doing this so you can put in

94
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:47,300
there just /b u slash Messier and then

95
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:51,280
copies down everything from doing

96
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,510
[Music]

97
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,119
[Applause]

98
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,120
[Music]

99
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,180
don't know exactly from high integrity

100
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,560
shell you will not get that air so even

101
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,389
if you're running it past the back of

102
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,310
the count low of medium integrity

103
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,750
session you will get that error I think

104
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,870
it's the way it's processed people only

105
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,009
on the client that you're on

106
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,009
[Music]

107
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,449
to restore files it's as easy as just

108
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,448
changing the source and destination

109
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:36,068
restoring the GBC ini file and in fact

110
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,069
[Music]

111
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,210
Microsoft made by default has the same

112
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,370
good wood for default of a controller

113
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,198
unless this is change which I have not

114
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,610
seen it or basic issue yet that's

115
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,979
changed it for the default domain

116
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:54,819
controllers this will always be the do

117
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:56,590
it within the directory seen below out

118
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:59,830
the group policy configuration files for

119
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,900
everything in effect policy are stored

120
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,180
within that floor you can go and take a

121
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,008
look dr. wood you'll see they separate

122
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,699
do it for every GPO that there is within

123
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,639
the domain

124
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,620
I've been started to actually go on my

125
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,419
tests to pull down policy from the

126
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:28,539
entire organization and then take your

127
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:30,279
offline and edit what this file does

128
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,409
pains all the permissions that you have

129
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,879
the various different accounts right

130
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:35,949
here this is from the default domain

131
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,759
controller group policy have to take a

132
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:42,069
look as we discussed earlier the

133
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,870
operators account NZ five five month and

134
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:47,229
we have not got privileges the ability

135
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:49,389
to log on the ability to log on

136
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:53,550
interactively restore files and shut

137
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,550
down the system this is the default

138
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,360
[Music]

139
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,320
one thing to note is the suit will

140
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,870
always have portion specific to the

141
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:33,150
domain and then the actual user 1:09

142
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:35,720
either the user specific this is this

143
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,719
can become

144
00:07:41,210 --> 00:08:00,640
[Music]

145
00:07:43,690 --> 00:08:02,170
once I was done 2016 so it's actually

146
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,430
when those 10 points we're throwing

147
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:08,800
errors that have the same first number

148
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,160
that I was putting in the GPT in her at

149
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,149
the GTI and I

150
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,149
[Music]

151
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,819
[Music]

152
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:43,909
probably took about 30 minutes or so for

153
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:43,909
the domain controller to update access

154
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,809
[Music]

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,070
restricted system you want to get access

156
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:01,070
to something far away we can actually

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,670
[Music]

158
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,950
applied to that system so that you know

159
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,719
what GPO is going to take a look at back

160
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:22,709
to directory we also need to know the

161
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:34,860
city account that we want to use so I

162
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:37,439
was hours looking to go to the ing bleep

163
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:45,690
and that is a member of the finance

164
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:48,089
station and it gives us it's gonna team

165
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,839
that do it as well where this is fervor

166
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,839
that growls here

167
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,070
just using get domain user again here

168
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,849
from Power View together with the City

169
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,850

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,258
[Music]

171
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,259
so now I'm gonna go this is the default

172
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:20,608
see here that we have Sid of the local

173
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:23,579
administrators account what I'm gonna do

174
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:26,369
is go and hand our accountant we want to

175
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:28,258
add to this now I tried thickness

176
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:29,939
initially and doing like I was doing on

177
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,679
the domain controllers taking the user

178
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:34,290
account Sid and then they get a member

179
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,149
of local administrators account and that

180
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,509
was failing on the end who's treating

181
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:43,049
infest this account the SID of the user

182
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:45,239
account as he so hot the works issued

183
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:47,530
after the proofs it first and then put

184
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:50,249
the sitter

185
00:10:47,530 --> 00:11:00,189
[Music]

186
00:10:50,249 --> 00:11:02,889
once that was not this is the policy so

187
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:06,300
take a look we have just administrator

188
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:06,300
ing station

189
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,209
once group policy updated on the system

190
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,160
so now we do whatever we want on the

191
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,340
system we have that been accessed to any

192
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,339
of this

193
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,109
so doing this up you can end up

194
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:32,390
generating a good amount of noise in

195
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,950
administrators and the machine that has

196
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:39,459
policy object lights get pretty noisy

197
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,300
and alerts all the sudden there's this

198
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:42,469
trigger on all these systems

199
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,598
[Music]

200
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,599
[Applause]

201
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:57,570
problems you this is now want something

202
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:11,010
done with that can be smart effects left

203
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:13,340
them yet we will stay so there's some

204
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,340
manual

205
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:23,010
let's start talking about that something

206
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:24,390
that can be enabled look what it's gonna

207
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,630
be different on every domain I haven't

208
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:30,000
run into that are the same yet actually

209
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:34,560
locks Lisa's just long successful some

210
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,970
lock failures so luckily for us we can

211
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,469
easily go and think look it let's

212
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,550
actually figured brought it into the

213
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,200
domain it's stored in the CSV file so if

214
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,870
you take a look here we can see audit

215
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,750
directory service access for success and

216
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,130
failure down there first bottom

217
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,200
this is I just want to check all the

218
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:55,080
boxes for everything in 8d in my lab to

219
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,490
turn on auditing for everything and

220
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,170
you'll see they give it up to talk it's

221
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,620
the same give it as earlier from leave

222
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,620
all the week

223
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,160
so I'd recommend if you're going to do

224
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,990
this little copy that file down go

225
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,199
through it everyone in the domain read

226
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,370
it and pull it down this is really

227
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,350
geared about to the settings the

228
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,480
detailed file share auditing and the

229
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,029
directory server status the detailed

230
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,600
files you're auditing the lot all file

231
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:23,610
share access on the system this is the

232
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,750
link of every system in the domain is

233
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,550
going to be going and flowing down

234
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,290
through policy whatever really moves

235
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,079
here every 90 minutes it's going to

236
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:35,579
generate a lot of laws so successive

237
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:38,160
failures enabled directory service

238
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,960
changes that block any changes to groups

239
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,240
or users within Active Directory

240
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,460
and if it's large domain there's gonna

241
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,960
be a lot of hogs there on a daily basis

242
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:50,660
so let's just go back to for second all

243
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,330
the settings are controlled by a CSP

244
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,459
active operators

245
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:59,510
that's disabled of audit so I literally

246
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:06,490
just my name we'll leave it at all

247
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:09,670
[Music]

248
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,740
so I restored the vial main controller

249
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,229
actually updated replicated this fairly

250
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:17,650
quickly because I'll show you changed

251
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:20,440
replicate that constantly and I went in

252
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:25,890
through the GUI and it shows that none

253
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,890
of the so everything is off

254
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,070
and he respects the changes we made

255
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:41,170
okay so now we've turned off Group

256
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,970
Policy also stores lot of registry

257
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,160
settings in the registry not all times

258
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,160
this contains both user settings in

259
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,420
computer settings

260
00:14:46,160 --> 00:15:01,600
[Music]

261
00:14:48,420 --> 00:15:02,229
you can't just pull out all the settings

262
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,900
that are in there

263
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,000
so we can use this get out the Machine

264
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:14,199
settings and the user settings and pull

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,930
them down a little bit different format

266
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:21,720
that you see going in through regedit

267
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:31,599
[Music]

268
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:41,550
these are from my lab one so now that we

269
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:44,140
have it sub wooden a power so one liner

270
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:47,170
straight there to go and run whatever

271
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,790
use your lock once I added that I just

272
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,089
combined both blue machine and the user

273
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:54,520
settings to single file and once that's

274
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:56,590
done I'll GPO that Exe it also allows us

275
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:00,329
to generate the new registry at Pala

276
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,330
file so I use that

277
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,679
[Music]

278
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,540
this was previous to the actually run

279
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,250
key getting cooled down if you look down

280
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,480
at the bottom there we only have two of

281
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:23,620
the settings are to run keys within HP

282
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,389
for security health in VMware once group

283
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,319
policy refreshed on the machine and a

284
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:31,240
user logged in I got a show now keep in

285
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:33,189
mind this will generate a shell if you

286
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:38,050
go this way for every user in that oh

287
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:39,870
you when they log into the sheet so once

288
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,519
that was actually on the machine but

289
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:45,850
look just make sure the registry key was

290
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,680
there and it's there also did learn what

291
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,000
going and removing these that registry

292
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,489
keys even though you may have restored

293
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,620
reduce registry dot all file is still

294
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,130
attached on the endpoints will stay

295
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,880
there

296
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:01,959
[Music]

297
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,599
my jackets but it's something you can

298
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:10,000
actually give and this is a way that you

299
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:11,469
can use policy you can use some of the

300
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,449
previous techniques that I just went

301
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,130
over to go and actually get at been on

302
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,410
one system that you're looking for drop

303
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:25,390
a dll on that system move certain paths

304
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:28,120
and then modify policy to do that for

305
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:31,720
that pop hijack whatever you're going

306
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,909
after there and when policy processes

307
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,070
registry that Paulo file it'll be there

308
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,210
and only if that ellos on the disk for

309
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,178
that machine will actually pop up

310
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:44,770
effective so it's weighted toward some

311
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:45,730
specific users within the domain now

312
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,440
there's also a lot of third-party

313
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,730
plugins Centrify is one that I've seen

314
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,980
wasn't able to get a copy for my lab so

315
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,660
I don't have screenshots of it but it

316
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,760
those we're all good settings and

317
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,950
registry Dabhol files that configures

318
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,470
little admins for Mac's as well as

319
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,240
whether SSH is enabled in a number of

320
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,100
other service lumens so you can actually

321
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,730
use the same technique to go and change

322
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,899
all the settings for Mac's

323
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,550
there's a number of other third-party

324
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,040
plugins out there as well that extend

325
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,990
Active Directory I haven't gotten played

326
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,909
with Lachlan so see what's out there

327
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:23,679
I did actually enable SSH on some end

328
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,390
points and then get little ended up on

329
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,280
those systems using the reversionary

330
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,780
down

331
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,639
[Music]

332
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:33,360
now I didn't go into too much depth here

333
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,220
but I just copied all those files

334
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,929
locally I modified them I wasn't trying

335
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,550
to be steeped in every sport my

336
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,160
concerted time stopping them match the

337
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,240
original last time for those files when

338
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:47,930
I pull them down from the domain

339
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,930
controller then restore them there

340
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,520
I just want to stress restore the

341
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,629
originals half here though

342
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,540
some other things I tried was trying to

343
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,579
do and failed I was trying to pull copy

344
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,579
[Music]

345
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:11,189
would have been great to be able to pull

346
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:14,430
that down to get all the user hashes but

347
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,050
did not work there's also you can use

348
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,730
some other third wording programs that

349
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,730
are going to be installed will actually

350
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,140
pull it down get a copy of that I wanted

351
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,490
to try and edit that file and there's

352
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,820
not much out there to actually edit

353
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:29,600
incorrectly and when you go to the store

354
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,600
it's gonna be locked

355
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:44,159
now some little be there clean it up

356
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:45,690
registry entries need to remain you may

357
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:49,559
want to actually go and just modify

358
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:52,110
their registry so that it on the systems

359
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,789
it doesn't will actually run and group

360
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,350
policy will accept all our changes as

361
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:58,970
you saw before they act correctly otter

362
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:02,209
day when I restored that file back to

363
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,210
see that

366
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,740
but should it be pocketed during regular

367
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:27,060
business hours or should it just be

368
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,060
logging in backups

369
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,500
some other things you can do for

4728 reading in 3d account luckily for

373
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:47,130
us when you had GPL INF file it's not

374
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,720
generate a login on the domain

375
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:59,610
controller so you can actually push that

376
00:20:48,720 --> 00:21:01,440
out this is from the puck detailed files

377
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,330
your honor and it will actually take a

378
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,100
note here that we wrote data to the

379
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:11,610
audit none CSV that's one take a walk if

380
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,110
that happens outside the bank policy

381
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,240
updates and some of these modifying

382
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,129
policies are over the network should

383
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,730
probably just becoming the main holders

384
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:23,190
themselves but they do requirements use

385
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,490
their editing group policy on that

386
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,670
sinking in DC not sure how that look up

387
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,850
so that's something take a look at

388
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:34,570
[Music]

389
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,699
now one screw policy does update this it

390
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,678
will act correctly auditing it does lock

391
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,250
that audit policies were changed further

392
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:41,470
than me

393
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,940
and go in if you open up the log files

394
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,700
it will tell you whether it was changed

395
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:48,610
to audit successful failure a lot of

396
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,850
success or if it's now disabled but we

397
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,850
have had

we're learning unanimity 5135 followed

400
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:04,750
by 57:19 this would be a fairly good way

401
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,970
to know that it was modified that policy

402
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,570
was changed to alert on the faculty role

fact controller in the policy settings

404
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:16,570
actually we're changing the system Walt

405
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,010
auditing settings are disabled to figure

406
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,919
out what was actually changed none of

407
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:23,080
your domain controller turned off

408
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:27,390
auditing no longer tracking any changes

409
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,389
you can start adding users created users

can actually collectively and probably

414
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:49,900
not get noticed any changes in that way

415
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,540
you recommend file integrity monitoring

00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,670
on the system would actually and you

417
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,170
would alert in miles have got cheese on

418
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,640
the domain controller and that's all

419
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:00,280
that you could trend over time watching

420
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,590
see what not change when luggage change

421
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,000
from a regular basis that maybe just

422
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,600
configure it will give the sysvol

424
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,190
what is this beautiful there are number

425
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:17,059
of miles on the main controller related

426
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:20,210
to that small version of all those miles

427
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:22,820
I can find the way to go and get it

428
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:33,320
keep it what's out there you go through

429
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:35,870
all those miles and see what there is is

430
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,389
that by modifying a lot of these systems

431
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:42,768
through the file system in restoring the

432
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:44,600
vials was not able to blog a lot and by

433
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:45,840
the fury of the logging that was in

some conclusions that I had monitoring

your back we're logging on outside the

438
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:59,360
regular back of the windows I'm making

439
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,650
changes to the file system that they

440
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,909
should just be back

441
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:07,340
that block any files on your domain

442
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,930
controllers highly recommend click on

443
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,840
file integrity monitoring so that you

444
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:14,540
have that in place and any of those

445
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,159
changes that are not expected in file

446
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:20,690
changes and little the afternoon under

447
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,040
DC go things with that change but he's

448
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,110
going to be able to see maybe

449
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,730
historically keep at backup what it

450
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:29,139
looks like before what it looks like now

451
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,140
it's you know wait

452
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:40,549
other than that let's figure out if

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:40,549
anyone has any questions one of HIV
