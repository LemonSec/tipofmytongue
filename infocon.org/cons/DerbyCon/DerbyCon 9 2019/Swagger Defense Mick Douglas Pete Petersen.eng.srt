1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
so hey welcome to derbycon we're doing

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,980
our staple talk here on swagger defense

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,349
so my name is Mick Douglas and this is

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,889
Pete Peterson

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:16,320
so Pete works at a redacted financial

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,330
services firm and a bunch of years ago

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,010
redacted for years and years and years

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:27,630
so while back I got to meet Pete and

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,260
this talk actually is like five years in

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,619
the making

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,550
well it's kind of like we put a

12
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,899
conversation that we've been having for

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:39,059
five years in three slides know how many

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,940
you know where we're at about 60 we

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,230
might not finish everything and one of

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,550
the things that you need to be aware of

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,410
is that this is going to be a very

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,300
strategic talk but we're going to have

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,788
some pretty interesting technical teeth

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,530
in this one and one of the things that

21
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,989
you need to understand when it comes to

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,489
doing defense better and one of the

23
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,370
things that I'm gonna be starting to

24
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,379
push and try to make a thing in the

25
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,110
industry is the term swagger swagger

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,798
defense and swagger defense isn't about

27
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,490
defense having swagger at all no in fact

28
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,760
what swagger defense is is taking

29
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,990
swagger from the attackers when you go

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,610
to the pawns you know it's all red team

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,880
all the time is what it seems like

32
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,220
and the problem is right now the deck is

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,920
stacked a little in their favor so what

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,500
we need to start doing is shifting the

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,619
narrative and tripping them up that's

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,409
where things like active defense are you

37
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,439
know a thing and one of the things that

38
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,960
we want to do is I realized that some of

39
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,520
you can't do true active defense and

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,020
countermeasures and honey pots what

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,039
we're going to do is give you some

42
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,199
options that take you closer to it one

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,630
of the things that I like to talk about

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,600
when it comes to swagger defenses it's

45
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,539
kind of like being in a rodeo right if

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,908
you're trying to wrestle a bull down to

47
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,520
the ground physics isn't gonna work

48
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,489
you're not gonna like block the bull and

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,949
then like to force it down you have to

50
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,480
use the Bulls momentum against it you

51
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:17,319
got to be smart and how you do that

52
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,929
so this talk is really that conversation

53
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,970
on how you go about stealing yeah very

54
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,890
importantly you kind of have to train

55
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,319
for if you're going to wrestle a bull

56
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,839
you have to train a lot so that that's a

57
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,518
okay thing to want to do right because

58
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,860
otherwise you're gonna get hurt yeah so

59
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,620
our hero and who we've lately been

60
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,709
modeling for we love clowns yeah we love

61
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,959
clowns by the way as an aside so I've

62
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:48,069
talked it just about every Derby con and

63
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,560
on Derby con one Dave Kennedy told me he

64
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,119
said Mick if you put an effing clown

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,890
picture in your presentation

66
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,190
you're never presenting at Derby con

67
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:01,358
again I guess I'm not gonna present

68
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,650
anymore but if you think about it the

69
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:05,109
rodeo clown is a pretty interesting

70
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,470
person to model after because he's

71
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:10,569
helping to keep a cowboy alive with a

72
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:15,510
little bit of training he might be a

73
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:19,540
target yeah and a barrel right so

74
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:24,849
misdirection is a thing doing little

75
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:28,180
bits of technique is a thing you know if

76
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:29,918
you have a bull charging you and the

77
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,540
Bulls coming at you and you just move by

78
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,590
this much and it misses by that much

79
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,810
it's still a mess so what we're gonna be

80
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,970
talking about a lot over the little bit

81
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,000
of time we have is how we're gonna focus

82
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,919
ourselves yeah and really this begins to

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
get into the more strategic portion

84
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:50,919
which is how do you decide what is going

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,370
to be important for you and your

86
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:55,870
organization and allocating your

87
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,639
resources which are time talent and

88
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,129
energy in order to find what's the

89
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,019
equivalent of your barrel right because

90
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,840
if you can find your barrel that's a

91
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:07,510
pretty simple thing to understand

92
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,139
implement and do so a lot of this talk

93
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,970
is about creating the barrel yep and

94
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,519
another thing that we want to push back

95
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,488
on in one of the reasons we used the

96
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,608
rodeo clown is kind of our model for who

97
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:23,799
we need to emulate is the you know what

98
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:26,388
they're not the perfect people right

99
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,249
they make mistakes they're they're goofy

100
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,139
and I think that a big part of the

101
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:33,080
problem that we have in the English I've

102
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,129
got euro do clouds drink ice oh they

103
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,758
probably do

104
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:39,620
I wouldn't tempt fate though but you

105
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,939
know you've got to be willing to make

106
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,289
mistakes because guess what you're

107
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:44,180
making them all the time it's just you

108
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:45,860
need to learn from them better and so

109
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,719
we've got some uncomfortable truths and

110
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,370
this is a whole bunch of phone calls

111
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:51,080
that Pete and I have been having where

112
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,509
we basically have been scaring each

113
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,789
other about some issues so the phone

114
00:04:53,509 --> 00:05:00,680
calls are not five minutes either no in

115
00:04:55,789 --> 00:05:02,719
fact our wives are just like yelling at

116
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,509
you and you've heard Heather yelling at

117
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,460
me so here's some uncomfortable truths

118
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:09,919
there's a lot of skilled attackers out

119
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:14,388
there most of your data is already

120
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,900
compromised we forced attackers now into

121
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,729
areas that we can't readily observe them

122
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:23,479
the attacks are happening incredibly

123
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:26,180
fast and there's script kiddie attackers

124
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:30,080
but there's also script kiddie defenders

125
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:33,949
and then static defense is a losing

126
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,419
proposition I see some pictures being

127
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:40,069
taken well we'll post the slides up

128
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:42,649
later so uncomfortable truth number one

129
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:45,080
there's many skilled people I don't know

130
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:49,189
if you folks saw it but a while back I

131
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,870
did a post on Twitter where I asked you

132
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:53,779
know at what point you consider people

133
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,669
to be elite and I know that this is

134
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:58,879
gonna hurt a lot of people's feelings

135
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:02,120
but you know not everyone's special in

136
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,139
fact you know everybody's unique just

137
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,879
like everyone else

138
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:09,889
so one little factoid that we ran into

139
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,289
is that the global cyber slash

140
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:15,319
information security workforce across

141
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:18,740
the entire globe is 4.5 million people

142
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:21,139
if you do the math on that once you

143
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,199
start getting to the upper crust there's

144
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,599
still a ton of people here now is way of

145
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,009
statistics I don't know if you know this

146
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:33,919
or not but division 1 football players

147
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:37,729
have a 1.5 percent chance of making it

148
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,279
to the NFL so when we are saying 1

149
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:45,019
percent that's pro grade

150
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:47,389
that's double Def Con and the 0.1%

151
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:51,139
you're talking unicorns at this point

152
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:53,869
and that's still more than Derby con so

153
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:55,399
when organizations tell me as a

154
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:58,929
consultant when they say oh well we can

155
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:01,429
stop all but the advanced are you sure

156
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:03,169
because there's a hell of a lot of them

157
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:05,958
can I make a interject of all thought

158
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:09,109
there so let's so just show hands who

159
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:13,159
thinks 1% is the number of elite who

160
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:16,969
thinks it's more closer to 0.1% okay who

161
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:21,709
thinks it's at 10% okay so nobody really

162
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:23,239
willing to commit to these values I will

163
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:26,599
make a note whether you think it's point

164
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:29,899
1% 1% or 5% doesn't really matter up in

165
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:40,699
those numbers how many companies are in

166
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:47,089
the S&P 500 so what's 45,000 divided by

167
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:49,579
500 900 that's going all at the same

168
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:51,919
time per company and that's not scripts

169
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:58,999
those are trained qualified attackers

170
00:07:51,919 --> 00:08:00,349
every single day so next uncomfortable

171
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:02,989
truth most of your data is already

172
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:06,829
compromised and one of my favorite

173
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:09,078
quotes about this is from Eric Conrad at

174
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:10,939
derbycon 6 he said I'm already

175
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,369
completely pwned

176
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:17,299
there is no bit of private data left for

177
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:20,419
me between OPM and Equifax breaches he's

178
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:23,959
100% public info he's now doing this for

179
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,369
my kids this is an ugly thing that you

180
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,019
need to take the leadership I'm not

181
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:28,759
saying that you have to violate your

182
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:31,149
contractual requirements I'm not saying

183
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,639
you have to violate your you know

184
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:36,279
different regulations but what the hell

185
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,389
are you protecting

186
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:42,379
we got a particular social security

187
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:44,149
number seriously folks so what you need

188
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:47,629
to do is sit down I did that it didn't

189
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:50,089
work it didn't work yet find out what is

190
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:53,050
that thing that makes your organization

191
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:55,000
special like for me Mike

192
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,760
a InfoSec innovations would cease to

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,100
exist overnight if my client list got

194
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,410
leaked right I joke the only way you

195
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,710
find out who my clients are is a client

196
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,810
discloses or court order discretion is

197
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,910
what we do that I would assume it a

198
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,369
redacted and financial services company

199
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,850
discretion is what you do as we are all

200
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:20,980
about our reputation yeah and so protect

201
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:23,620
that here's another one we have forced

202
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,810
attackers now to the desktops we have

203
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,390
better logging than ever at the servers

204
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,609
we've got great firewall logs going into

205
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,340
the sins we've got crisp and clean

206
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,680
detection I'm not asking for you to

207
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,260
raise your hand but if you are

208
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,109
collecting logs from all the desktops

209
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,400
all the laptops in your organization

210
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,710
give yourself a pat on the back because

211
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,870
you are in rarefied territory

212
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,270
the attackers go after the client-side

213
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:53,200
attacks because that's where the access

214
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:57,189
is and here's the other thing we're not

215
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,640
looking oh you've got an EDR tool Oh

216
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,170
okay cute they download them and run

217
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,090
them in their lab environment they know

218
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,589
how to bypass them hell they even know

219
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,660
what you're using because your job

220
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:12,520
posting says we need somebody that can

221
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:15,250
use product here and then they say mmm I

222
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,439
wonder what I have to bypass so you know

223
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,510
it's a real problem on the desktops and

224
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,850
you've got a important note there it's

225
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,770
like if they're looking at LinkedIn as a

226
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,560
source of recon they also know who the

227
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,510
admins are what tools they're using and

228
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,130
then if they want to go after the admins

229
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,510
and just bypass all that annoying user

230
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,670
stuff so they don't have to escalate

231
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,380
they'll just look at LinkedIn find them

232
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,089
because you're leaking all that data and

233
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,460
tell them exactly how to attack those

234
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,380
people oh yeah yeah no I mean that's

235
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,660
what I do own campaigns the other thing

236
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,340
is we have to stop blaming our users the

237
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,280
phishing campaigns that we do against

238
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,610
ourselves suck we got to be honest about

239
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,890
it

240
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,560
attackers cheat they will do things like

241
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:57,840
this they'll send an RFP bid to the

242
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,279
sales team are you gonna tell me

243
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,639
InfoSec Pro that you're gonna

244
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:07,120
have the sales team not open an RFP

245
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,980
proposal good luck with that because

246
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,589
that's a resume generating event right

247
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:15,310
there we'll see more about that in a

248
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:17,170
little bit yes got the cliffhanger now

249
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,459
here's another thing attacks are fast

250
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:23,680
and nothing but nothing scared me into

251
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:27,430
this reality is the not petty attack

252
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,758
this is from the wired article I they

253
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:32,079
walked through the how bad this one was

254
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,920
globally there was a there was a

255
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:41,109
multinational company that had a 99%

256
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,819
infection rate 16 seconds most of you

257
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,100
all have Incident Response procedures

258
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:48,719
where you contact management for

259
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,970
permission to make firewall changes

260
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:57,730
seriously you got to start getting

261
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:59,470
faster also and this is brutal there's a

262
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,209
lot of script kiddies out there to be

263
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,889
fair their script kiddie attackers but

264
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:05,559
there's a lot of script kiddie defenders

265
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,720
John strand has that quote that I love

266
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:10,180
to say all the time every time you press

267
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:16,569
the easy button God deploys a botnet in

268
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:18,939
your environment snake oil in the

269
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,889
industry because people don't understand

270
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:24,129
the tool they're just downloading the

271
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:26,730
thing running it and is it working well

272
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:29,139
the lights are blinking so I mean

273
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,439
there's there's a lot of really weird

274
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:34,839
perverse economics going on and part of

275
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:37,629
the issue is that vendors are only being

276
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:41,649
held to account to what we do so you

277
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:44,199
need to start queuing your tools no

278
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:46,779
that's so weird don't know how that got

279
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:48,899
in there is that the equivalent of

280
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,819
today's brick wall that might be the

281
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,709
rule if you don't know what I'm talking

282
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:57,969
about do a little Google search and let

283
00:12:53,709 --> 00:13:00,748
the walls let the walls roll okay here's

284
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:06,569
another one a static defense

285
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:06,569
it's just toast you know I mean

286
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:12,660
this is what we're doing and for 20

287
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:14,849
years now we've told people you know

288
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:19,679
half patches deploy firewalls run your

289
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:23,429
antivirus how's that working right so

290
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:26,339
we're at a really rough spot and Pete

291
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:28,589
and I that's deliberately plank and I

292
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:31,319
have really been getting a little kind

293
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:32,720
of sad about how things are cuz the

294
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:36,479
state of the industry is pretty rough

295
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,809
yeah and so it's okay to admit that

296
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,419
we're having problems but I don't think

297
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:43,829
it's okay to just like piss and moan and

298
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:46,709
not do anything about it

299
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:49,049
so what we've been doing is coming up

300
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:53,160
with some things that might help or

301
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:55,379
might change stuff so a couple ways path

302
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,059
forward first of all find the core of

303
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,910
your organization what's that secret

304
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:02,519
sauce that if it gets out your

305
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,350
organization ceases to be and if it's

306
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,980
part of a public data breach it probably

307
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:10,589
doesn't fit this criteria so start

308
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,369
defending like you mean it and there's a

309
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:18,360
great collection of advice the peat came

310
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:19,889
across on how to sheep battle plan so I

311
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,139
must see so so a lot of what I think

312
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:24,779
about is strategic collections of

313
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:27,600
controls and deploying resources so I

314
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:30,029
tend to think more strategically being

315
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,610
what wool sets and what architectures am

316
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:35,639
I going to file follow in order to

317
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,799
achieve an objective or an event or

318
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,179
whatever we're trying to do and as I was

319
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,709
beginning to think about this over the

320
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:43,529
past couple years one of the first

321
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,089
things I realized is like we don't know

322
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:47,489
what winning is we don't have an

323
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,709
objective when we're just defending you

324
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:51,749
you don't win by just defending you

325
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:53,998
can't do anything by just defending so

326
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:55,679
there's to be another element to it so I

327
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:57,299
started researching that kind of stuff

328
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,369
and I basically came up there you know

329
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:01,110
the Army has published nine principles

330
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:02,850
of war it's part of their broader

331
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,609
doctrine they teach in the War College

332
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:08,429
since like the 1920s it's all based on

333
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:11,309
previous battles and it is this so I

334
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:13,230
chose five out of nine because moose has

335
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:15,329
four feet or five you know and it's kind

336
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,029
of like a bull so here we are with moose

337
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:20,310
so starting at the concentration of

338
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:22,589
superior power at the point of decision

339
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,638
so what if we decided we sided the point

340
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:29,879
of decision is the desktop right so

341
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,410
deploy their concentrate your power your

342
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:37,620
will your time your material your

343
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:39,480
Reese's on the desktop today and do it

344
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,129
again so that achieves your objective

345
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:47,069
your objective is your stated intent so

346
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:48,959
in this case define what your stated

347
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:50,399
intent is maybe you've discovered

348
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,229
something that's really important on

349
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,410
your network and you don't want that to

350
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:58,199
happen but I will tell you yeah so our

351
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,449
objective here is we want to make

352
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:05,339
attacking so costly that the attackers

353
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:08,008
say no sir and walk away yes so if we're

354
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:11,009
gonna say our objective is to win and

355
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:12,269
what does win look like well in these

356
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:14,610
principles they teach you

357
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:17,399
winning is when the enemy stops

358
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,620
attacking so how do we get there if

359
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,180
that's your objective we got a lot of

360
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,699
work to do and a lot of hard thinking

361
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,649
and retooling to make that happen

362
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,839
against whether it be forty five hundred

363
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:33,899
or forty five thousand attackers that's

364
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:36,870
coming for you offense means all of your

365
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:39,480
actions all of your defenses better have

366
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,339
an offensive component that goes towards

367
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,199
achieving your objective this all makes

368
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,550
sense later in the slide but this is

369
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,139
just what's going in as we're just as

370
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,889
Nick and I are designing a set of

371
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,910
controls to achieve these things

372
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,389
simplicity it's got to be super stuff

373
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:56,689
you got to find your barrel an easy idea

374
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:59,069
that you can implement everywhere

375
00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:02,040
because everybody can understand simple

376
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:04,918
right if it's you've got a stack your

377
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,199
security stack is 500 tools and bro logs

378
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,089
here and packet captures here that's

379
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,890
complex that's a lot of surface area to

380
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:14,760
attack and the attackers will just own

381
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,919
your detection tools at that point the

382
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,990
economy of force is related to mass and

383
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,949
that just means if I'm going to focus

384
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:26,669
all my efforts on the point of decision

385
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:27,780
focus less other where for example let's

386
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:32,429
say we're talking about getting them

387
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,990
onto the desktop let's say you do things

388
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:35,940
to channel them into the

389
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,610
stop for example private D lands or

390
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,270
vassals or things like that those are

391
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:45,780
going to need to be used again to foster

392
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,460
the mass make sense right so this is

393
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,820
just a way to think about the problem of

394
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,190
the cyber security as its evolving so

395
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,570
now this I wish I could take a picture

396
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,630
of y'all's faces you're like what the

397
00:17:54,570 --> 00:18:00,120
hell just happened so here's the deal my

398
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,679
degrees in philosophy by the way so

399
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,570
here's the deal we've got to start

400
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,850
simplifying things we got to start doing

401
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,129
things more effectively and the

402
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,409
attackers are doing this already they

403
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,290
have these talks where they talk about

404
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:15,480
living off the land for offense we need

405
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,940
to start living off the land for defense

406
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,200
that leaves us things like this and a

407
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,200
lot of you are looking at this going

408
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,080
really that's what we got to fight with

409
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,400
how is this fair well that's actually

410
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,220
what we're kind of trying to shoot for

411
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,900
here right so what the attackers are

412
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,910
expecting when they see that this is our

413
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,490
defenses they think that's what we're

414
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,890
bringing to fight now here's what

415
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:41,280
they're gonna run into okay rodeo clown

416
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:43,620
so what we're gonna do here is do a demo

417
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,550
of the current state it's just a real

418
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,860
simple thing we're gonna pop a

419
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:50,399
meterpreter do you want a chapel I set

420
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:52,559
that up so what we're doing is making is

421
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,130
going to be demoing a set of typical

422
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,540
things that you'd see any 504 class and

423
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,250
they're gonna go hey this is effective

424
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,300
and we're gonna go wow look she'll and

425
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,980
it's going to be easy and then we're

426
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,080
gonna do an easy thing and then there's

427
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,610
not going to be shell and then we're

428
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,770
going to do another really easy thing

429
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:10,428
and they're really not going to be shell

430
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,710
and what that's going to do that's gonna

431
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:15,300
stop any element of recon back into the

432
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,450
attackers mind so what we want to do

433
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:21,419
with these tools is inspect the brain

434
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:24,059
make them doubt create self doubt within

435
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,070
it did I compile my interpreter wrong

436
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:28,050
did I get it to the desktop do you guys

437
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,600
have now do they have a web browser

438
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:32,370
we want to give them nothing and if we

439
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,678
do give them information back we want to

440
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,600
give them misleading information back so

441
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,960
that their next wave of attack is wrong

442
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,000
so here just to show no tricks what

443
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,140
we've got is a simple multi handler

444
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,060
running

445
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,600
and we slide over to our victim machine

446
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:52,860
and this is where the RFP let me zoom in

447
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,209
here this RFP unzipped executable this

448
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,050
would who doesn't want to click on that

449
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,970
RFP I'll tell you what any sales person

450
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:03,389
that's commission driven shows hell will

451
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:08,490
so here's the deal you double click this

452
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:09,990
this is really just amateur protects try

453
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,680
that again

454
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:17,520
[Music]

455
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:23,610
are you there we go so compromised okay

456
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:30,120
watch what happens though if we just

457
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:32,780
make a real quick change what we're

458
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,550
gonna do is implement a firewall rule

459
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,230
simple easy peasy lemon squeezy

460
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,409
Derby demo we're gonna block the

461
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,500
connection outbound everybody's scared

462
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:45,690
about doing host-based firewall blocking

463
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,990
outbound is a dramatically easier thing

464
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:56,310
to do because now we're listening so we

465
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:57,720
go over here we were run it well wait

466
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:05,399
let's make sure the firewalls are

467
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:06,510
stopped here we go let's demo fail ok

468
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,340
but you know what here's some interest

469
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:12,420
part in your defenses where you have to

470
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:14,750
enable the tools now is just to make the

471
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,750
point

472
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:26,240
[Music]

473
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:35,300
there Oh demo fail what has the snap

474
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:40,270
so imagined Oh she'll yeah they're their

475
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:43,780
own one more time then we'll move on

476
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:55,639
there's nothing simpler than not working

477
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:57,500
as we all know camel there we go

478
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,410
nothing's happening and here's the cool

479
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:04,490
thing this is where the attackers know

480
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:08,809
what's going on no no I had nothing so

481
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:10,550
okay so the thing that you need to

482
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,160
accept is that our networks are

483
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:16,190
complicated and attackers are taking

484
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:19,280
advantage of this so they see our

485
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,660
networks is real easy because they've

486
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,520
done the recon they understand how the

487
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:28,550
pieces parts are together so here's how

488
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,350
the Moose gets applied yeah so this is

489
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,899
as I was thinking about applying moves

490
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:36,590
to a typical corporate network this is

491
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,660
what I was thinking all of my controls

492
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,580
everything let's get them on the desktop

493
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:43,220
where I know where my particular skills

494
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:46,250
are and I know how to manage it and log

495
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,929
and alert on that right so that seems

496
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,130
like the opposite of what you want but

497
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:50,420
it's really if you get them there

498
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,340
they're not going anywhere and if you

499
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,370
can keep them from getting anywhere from

500
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,169
there that's really a good situation

501
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:59,239
because you can turn your desktops in

502
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,730
just to this incredible sensor network

503
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,400
with a lot of good Intel

504
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,710
the attackers again for purpose of

505
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,900
design here we've decided how are the to

506
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,730
win conditions we want to make the

507
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,650
attackers stop the second win condition

508
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,050
if we're red teaming that as a result of

509
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:18,470
the engagement it's not just me learning

510
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:20,270
the red team's getting better too again

511
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,610
we talked about this so all of the

512
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,710
offensive all the defensive tactics are

513
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,770
designed specifically to keep them on

514
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:30,340
that desktop all my other controls again

515
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,879
funding them into the desktop again and

516
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,620
I figure why not

517
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,259
if attackers are living off the land why

518
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,949
can't I defend off the land oh I'm sorry

519
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:44,340
yeah counter-attack off the land because

520
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:46,470
the defense again is not a principle so

521
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,209
let's talk a blocker application

522
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,799
whitelisting can be bypassed but in

523
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,779
order to bypass it you have to make

524
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:54,090
noise once you've got application

525
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:56,639
whitelisting up and running it's as

526
00:23:54,090 --> 00:24:00,299
simple as consuming application logs and

527
00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:00,809
looking for a single event ID it's that

528
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,940
easy

529
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:07,769
mmm has sorry has anybody from binary

530
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,059
defense seen this event before so one

531
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:11,490
thing that everybody gets squirrelly

532
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:13,799
about though when it comes to doing this

533
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,570
analysis is they say I don't want to

534
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:18,720
turn this on because I'm gonna get in

535
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:29,450
trouble well what you do is if you run

536
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:29,450
something like sis Mon you could let's

537
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,409
[Music]

538
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:37,889
so what I've got here is a tool called

539
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:50,309
security Taylor what it does is woops

540
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:52,639
we've got to be admin so what this tool

541
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:56,519
does is it allows you to actually

542
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:58,168
consume your system on logs to get a

543
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,139
running list of all the applications

544
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:03,000
that user ran you want to do application

545
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:05,070
whitelisting do this it's simple easy

546
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,990
and you're gonna have nobody care

547
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:10,740
because to them it will be completely

548
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,990
transparent so I hope we've given you

549
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,210
guys some things to think about I hope

550
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,879
that you understand that this is just

551
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,210
the start the deck is stacked against

552
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:21,080
you

553
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:25,409
it's not fair but nothing in life is I

554
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:28,139
want you to start realizing that fall

555
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:30,179
seven times stand eight is the way

556
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:32,969
forward let's go fight and win together

557
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:36,360
I'll put the slide deck out I'll post it

558
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:38,940
on Twitter let me put let me jump to the

559
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,740
thing where we have that you guys can

560
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,020
take pictures and then Pete and I will

561
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,210
be outside answering any and all

562
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,340
questions you may have run out of time

563
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:51,270
we did run out of time there's some

564
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,850
really cool slides left and we've got

565
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:55,470
bonus content too for you so hopefully

566
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,560
this starts making you guys think about

567
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,140
stuff there's one cool judo flip that I

568
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,580
do want to tell you about so that you do

569
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,670
think about going up and downloading

570
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:08,310
some thinking about these whitelisting

571
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:10,590
policies it is possible to really really

572
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:12,419
protect yourself by simply blacklisting

573
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:15,689
Microsoft within your app why tap

574
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,910
whitelisting policy and that's that by

575
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,260
the way yeah and that sucks for the

576
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,750
attackers because that leaves you

577
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:25,670
nothing to use it leaves you no land the

578
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,670
land is fallow so thank you

579
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,789
[Applause]
