back's a little fine okay wait is that a

26
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:09,010
bad thing okay so even though it's not

27
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:12,099
that kind of con we have not a drinking

28
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,750
game for you this you probably don't

29
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,429
have drinks in your hand but we wanted

30
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,988
to have something interactive and we

31
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,699
don't want to promote the crippling

32
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,529
alcoholism that affects us all in our

33
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:22,919
daily lives because of the jobs that we

34
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,090
have to do darkest timeline a little bit

35
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,710
so what we're gonna do is we have a

36
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,159
number of words we're likely to say a

37
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,840
whole bunch during this one is security

38
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,669
engagement you're gonna hear that a lot

39
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,690
and there's a noise you're gonna make

40
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:36,340
and don't worry if this doesn't make

41
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,330
sense we have an educational video for

42
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,250

companies have a security engagement

118
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,810

we're hands and another one nice so

120
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:44,250

house we are we are the red team we've

124
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:57,510
got a few how many folks have a red team

125
00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:00,440
inside their company yeah Wow secured

126
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:04,329
even meeting being written all that

127
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,279
how many folks front row notwithstanding

128
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:10,219
have this dreamy thing where you have

129
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,170
both of them you have security

130
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,329
engagement and regime and not only that

131
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,910
but they work together and they're part

132
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:22,040
of the same thing would you say that

133
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:26,750
they have synergy let's hear it for

134
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:29,930
synergy because that is what this talk

135
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,870
is about it's about synergy it's about

136
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,089
how these two things can perhaps be

137
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,209
better together and by combining them

138
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:40,189
you can get a lot more and what we would

139
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,979
like you to leave here today with is

140
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:45,139
perhaps a few tips maybe some ammunition

141
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,879
if you're ever looking to build a

142
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:49,069
program like this or if you ever find

143
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,050
yourself where you want to be able to

144
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:53,120
make the argument to have these types of

145
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,649
things in your organization and you want

146
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
to know how to figure out building them

147
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,930
and maybe not get clobbered by it

148
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,269
because it's a dangerous world out there

149
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:05,839
so if you ever find yourself needing

150
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:09,410
these hopefully you can get it done

151
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,930
however it's hard because it's a lot

152
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,569
easier said than done much like a 2020

153
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,829
Kayne presidency and there's a number of

154
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:18,380
reasons for that

155
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:21,709
first of which both of these things are

156
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,800
very much a luxury item it's things that

157
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:26,388
they're it's expensive a to pay us to do

158
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,130
this kind of stuff especially when it's

159
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:31,160
not just directly going out there and

160
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,100
fixing bugs it's expensive to hire

161
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,439
people to just go around and point out

162
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,139
flaws and we all work in security so we

163
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:41,660
already know how many laws there are

164
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:43,550
everywhere everything's broken and why

165
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,309
would we want someone to come tell us

166
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,599
about things being more broken like we

167
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:51,110
already know we just need more people to

168
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,970
help us fix it and it's also pretty bad

169
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,069
for our friends in security engagement

170
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,689
right why would you want someone just to

171
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:59,089
focus on making people care about

172
00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:02,089
security more just to focus on trying to

173
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:04,970
change behavior trying to focus on that

174
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:07,990
human element when there's so many

175
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:10,570
technical vulnerabilities around us

176
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,640
but if we get lucky enough where someone

177
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,740
decides they want to buy that luxury

178
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,870
item and they sign up to have one of

179
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,120
these things

180
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,550
nobody knows where to put us and what

181
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,790
often happens is we end up in this place

182
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:28,180
where you're just kind of at the whim of

183
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:31,550
whoever decided they needed you for red

184
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,819
team sometimes it's the legal team yeah

185
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,020
[Music]

186
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,880
sometimes the legal team sometimes it's

187
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,470
product security and then if you're a

188
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,800
red team on product security what do you

189
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,480
do you do prod set so I've even seen it

190
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,849
where red teams exist and they're a

191
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,050
function of the blue team's the worst

192
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,830
because then they call themselves purple

193
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,030
team and they think they're really

194
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,140
forward-thinking but really they're just

195
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:54,790
doing a fraction of the job that they

196
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:57,810
could be doing sorry and we've got the

197
00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:02,140
same problem over on security engagement

198
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:04,680
I think we have a little bit worse have

199
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:10,560
you as a red team ever ended up in

200
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:13,120
compliance well no I had self-respect

201
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,180
due to PCI HIPAA sarbanes-oxley

202
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,740
compliance is a popular place for a

203
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,410
security engagement security or an

204
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,180
esteem to land but when this happens you

205
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,469
end up doing run-of-the-mill check the

206
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,670
block's security awareness videos or

207
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,770
sometimes you get a bit luckier you end

208
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,500
up in engineering which is not a bad

209
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,600
place to land but because of human

210
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,790
nature and people wanting to just focus

211
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,410
on their own kind you end up really just

212
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,589
focusing on security development life

213
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,390
cycle at the absence of looking at the

214
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,090
rest of the organization even though we

215
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:49,030
all know that risks exists in all areas

216
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,800
of the business or you end up with the

217
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,990
opposite problem you're allowed to

218
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,939
educate everyone except engineers

219
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:59,410
because you're not technical enough to

220
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:02,050
speak to an engineer next you have

221
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,060
above-average social skills in high EQ

222
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,900
which makes everyone think that you are

223
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,339
the team event planner or just because

224
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,939
you can write everything from

225
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,610
company-wide

226
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,920
emails to blog posts of course material

227
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,680
doesn't mean that this team is your tech

228
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,870
writer everyone wants this mythical

229
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,959
creature with all of you skillsets but

230
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,360
no one wants to pay for

231
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:28,100
it or consider the incredible rarity of

232
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,980
a unicorn enter the cycle of security

233
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,540
culture doom often do despite in a

234
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,160
career focused deep in tech or

235
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:39,530
engineering there's this misconception

236
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:42,829
I'm sorry oh here I am talking about

237
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:46,180
speaking skills misconception of the

238
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:48,170
resources required to build this program

239
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,050
videos don't grow on trees

240
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,849
gamification sounds cool innovate

241
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,609
innovative in fact for the platform

242
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,960
required to track all these actions and

243
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,660
the points cost money

244
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,910
the rewards also associated with these

245
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,560
programs cost money even more so if your

246
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,550
program is successful because then you

247
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,290
have a lot of rewards to give out

248
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,719
expectations for this role then border

249
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:15,319
on unrealistic you have to be good at

250
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,750
presenting writing have arguably the

251
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,380
widest breadth of security and privacy

252
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:23,390
knowledge in the field data science to

253
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,580
track the efficacy of your program

254
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,520
learning theory to get these knowledge

255
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,720
bits to stick behavioral science because

256
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,930
you know you're trying to actually

257
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,960
change some behavior design video and

258
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,750
photo editing skills to make your

259
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,520
content look good and event planning to

260
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,890
get people excited about the stuff that

261
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,600
you're doing and on top of all of this

262
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,730
you have to be able to think like an

263
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,710
attacker to simulate attacks looking at

264
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,780
you fishing at this stage of the

265
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:53,270
program's either with inadequate funding

266
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,970
these unicorn stables cost a lot of

267
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:58,490
money or you were never able to find

268
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,290
your unicorn to begin with your program

269
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,150
fails to be you the Prancing success

270
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,550
that you once envisioned it to be and

271
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:07,160
then because these programs are often

272
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,770
set up for failure our industry views

273
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,290
them as run by soft soft incompetence

274
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:16,010
and not a success me I'm gonna let you

275
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:19,339
finish here but there's a bigger problem

276
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,990
than this it goes deeper it's part of

277
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,050
all of us the things that we do and

278
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:27,110
that's the fact that we disagree

279
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:29,750
constantly the first time that I had the

280
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,550
responsibility of the fishing program I

281
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,290
talked to Sam about and I'm like I think

282
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,910
we could do this like could make a good

283
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,370
improvement

284
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:42,750
she was like why would you strive for

285
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:46,620
mediocrity I said do you even know why

286
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,700
indeed and because we're constantly

287
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,380
disagreeing about it and I know I'm the

288
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,030
biggest hypocrite ever because here we

289
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,760
are disagreeing about what it should be

290
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:57,819
like but because we constantly do this

291
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,620
we constantly argue about what is a good

292
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:03,220
red team what is a good secure engaging

293
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:06,640
program what we end up with is a lack of

294
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,860
definition and because we can't define

295
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,020
ourselves because we can't communicate

296
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:13,300
to other people what our value is nobody

297
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:19,150
understands our value and we sit there

298
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:22,839
like a sad little Kanye so I present to

299
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:26,280
you this new and innovative thing the

300
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:30,899
conjoined squares of a allistic success

301
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:33,340
synergy I know right I'm excited too

302
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,350
because these two things we have a lot

303
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,040
of common right we both have this lack

304
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:42,040
of definition we both fail to define

305
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,320
ourselves really well and we both exist

306
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,270
in this state where we've got a lot of

307
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,810
vendors who think they can do it too and

308
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,340
the marketplace is saturated and because

309
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,500
of that there's a lot of external people

310
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,179
selling the bare minimum that is

311
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,770
supposed to do what we're trying to

312
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,270
build but we know we could probably do

313
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,030
it better internally because we can

314
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,889
customize things to our internal needs

315
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,590
the internal culture of our companies

316
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,240
and we actually care and we don't just

317
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,889
drop in a product and walk away and

318
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,700
sorry for all the vendors who think

319
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:15,510
they're really great but there's more to

320
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:19,570
that though I mean we have some failures

321
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:25,120
that are very complementary like sorry

322
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:27,250
security engagement but yeah suck it

323
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,979
real phishing making it realistic

324
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:32,740
because you've probably never been

325
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:36,570
behind the keyboard typing that email

326
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,570
actually trying to get a shell

327
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:43,410
right but red team is really good at one

328
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,150
done fishing engagements whenever you're

329
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,520
done it for a large group of people

330
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,290
consistently

331
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,600
okay yeah you're right you know we

332
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,860
normally you just kind of get shell once

333
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,860
and we don't really test the entire

334
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:58,320
population but it works right I guess we

335
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,490
don't really care about making change or

336
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,250
I guess we really don't care about

337
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:05,010
working with partners because let's face

338
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,040
it red team we're really not people

339
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,350
people it's a lot easier to whisper to

340
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,780
those ones and zeros and make the door

341
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,399
open up than it is to have a meeting

342
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,660
with some other people to actually make

343
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,040
something useful

344
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:21,960
I guess but then because security

345
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,909
engagement often doesn't come from a

346
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,220
heavy engineering or technology

347
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,900
background your escena is just not quite

348
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,020
neat enough to get a seat at the table

349
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,880
there's usually an annual pull post on

350
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:36,570
Twitter by someone who I will not

351
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,040
mention at this time asking if you can

352
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:42,780
really be in security if you're not

353
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:45,360
really good at coding yeah so on behalf

354
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:49,010
of red team sorry for that sorry for all

355
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,979
that wheat wheat shaming as it were so

356
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:54,420
present to you an obvious alliance of

357
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,450
these two things if you didn't see this

358
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,980
coming right

359
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:03,000
security engagement and red team can

360
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,110
work together and try and address some

361
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,059
of the real problems and make a bigger

362
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,280
impact right because red team can lend

363
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,809
that credibility right that leanness

364
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,678
that we already have that we care about

365
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:15,360
so much and security engagement can

366
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,800
focus on actually changing behavior

367
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,449
focusing on actually getting that

368
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:23,129
message out in an impactful way so

369
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,929
advertising media that's how we

370
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,750
organized our program we call it

371
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:29,160
propaganda machine except no one would

372
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,559
actually let me call it that so I only

373
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,290
named our slack channel that but we call

374
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,120
it proactive engagements the idea is

375
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,490
that all of these programs come together

376
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,709
under one umbrella to kind of feed each

377
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,390
other and it's like that at a formal

378
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,980
level in the organization structure and

379
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:46,320
it's a core pillar of our security

380
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,970
program we've got the red team we've got

381
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,309
phishing we've got security engagement

382
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,550
got security education all aligned

383
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:55,710
behind this one goal of changing

384
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:58,309
behaviors actually making a difference

385
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,309
right

386
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:09,270
yeah but aren't you trying to change

387
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:12,929
behaviors yeah are you trying to

388
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:14,460
engineer behaviors nice so why wouldn't

389
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,090
you just call it behavioral engineering

390
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:21,050
if I didn't think of that yeah I think

391
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:23,520
security engagement security awareness

392
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,730
propaganda machine West propaganda

393
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:31,050
machine proactive engagement out

394
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:33,090
behavioral engineering in but you know

395
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,830
how can you computer easy program in a

396
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,330
human is hard you need some good

397
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:40,560
foundations with your behavioral

398
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:42,389
engineering first is design the hardest

399
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,310
thing is just reducing choice and

400
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,170
ability to make bad decisions but that

401
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:49,860
will make your program the most

402
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:52,190
impactful you know if you make simple

403
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,229
changes like in your email client

404
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,660
notifying users when emails come in from

405
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:01,140
someone outside of your organization or

406
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:04,440
making a password manager really easy to

407
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,350
implement it's this design concept that

408
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,600
someone in Japan his name's CheY Ghosh

409
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:12,149
and ago something like that worked for

410
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,449
Toyota at one point he came up with this

411
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:17,040
thing called okay okay which sounds like

412
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,410
the newest Pokemon but it's not it's the

413
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,510
idea that if you design things in a way

414
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:24,240
that makes it hard to make the mistake

415
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,830
or impossible it is a better design

416
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,050
think about when you go to plug

417
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,340
something in the outlet one size is

418
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,080
different in America because we didn't

419
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,270
really didn't like try very hard at this

420
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,210
but in other countries like it can only

421
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:39,450
be plugged in one way it prevents you

422
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,700
from making the bad choice so rather

423
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:44,160
than like all the plug manufacturer is

424
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,850
saying hey please plug the plugs in the

425
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,410
right way we say okay you're gonna make

426
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,030
mistakes let's make it impossible for

427
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,880
you to make that mistake or even better

428
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:56,040
like a better explanation of this or a

429
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,350
better example of this is the USB see

430
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,760
right now it's impossible to plug it in

431
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,610
the wrong way it's just fine no matter

432
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,620
how you do it

433
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,179
sorry I got really excited about pokey

434
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:09,080
if it actually used to be called baka

435
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:10,940
yogi which was which was idiot proof or

436
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,409
fool true but then I think they wanted

437
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,960
to market it a little bit better so they

438
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:19,420
made it a little lighter clip so perhaps

439
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:23,410
we in security you can do some baka okay

440
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,410
don't you mean okay okay

441
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:31,969
next one of your greatest threat actors

442
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,680
is the customer the user that simply

443
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:37,370
doesn't know the security or privacy

444
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,040
mind thing to do and the simple tool for

445
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,090
that is educating them giving them the

446
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,760
content and knowledge that they need to

447
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:46,280
make the better choice the harder

448
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,310
adversary that you have is the user that

449
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,649
knows better but doesn't care about

450
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,480
doing the right thing and for them you

451
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,610
need to build a positive sentiment with

452
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,930
your security and privacy teams give

453
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,270
them the motivation to do the right

454
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:02,660
thing generally through gamification or

455
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:04,160
some other motivation techniques and

456
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,040
then practicing good bedside manner

457
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,260
within your team and then last measure

458
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,430
ability to ensure that you can prove

459
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,080
efficacy over time

460
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:16,080
[Music]

461
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,730
so behavioral change campaigns is kind

462
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,158
of the idea that we're presenting here

463
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,470
and like any campaign you need to have a

464
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,360
clear goal you have to clearly define

465
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,669
what behavior it is that you want to

466
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,090
change before you start then you have to

467
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:32,159
measure if something changed and then

468
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:35,668
you actually have to follow up and

469
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,619
communicate it out you can't just do

470
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:39,059
something in a little bubble and expect

471
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:41,039
other people to understand that you've

472
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,830
done something now

473
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,009
we're not kind of like the first people

474
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:49,199
to ever think of this there's actually a

475
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:51,570
group of people who really care about

476
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,179
changing human behavior and they do so

477
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,730
so all of us dum-dums don't kill

478
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,529
ourselves with disease and such and they

479
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,269
are called the World Health Organization

480
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:02,279
and they already document what a

481
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:03,450
behavioral change campaign can be and

482
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:05,309
they have this definition a health

483
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,200
campaign something that follows a

484
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:08,460
specific sequence that moves the target

485
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,470
audience from awareness of an issue

486
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,779
towards a behavior resulting in a

487
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,619
specific health outcome what if we

488
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:18,299
replace health with security here and we

489
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,609
thought about behavioral change change

490
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,470
campaigns in the context of security and

491
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:24,600
we think a security behavioral change

492
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,779
campaign follows a specific sequence

493
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,759
that moves our target audience from

494
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,379
awareness of an issue kind of knowing

495
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,779
that security is important towards the

496
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:37,049
behavior and it results in a specific

497
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:40,320
security outcome okay they do the thing

498
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:42,090
we want them to do they have some other

499
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,580
advice too that is really useful for us

500
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:48,689
but involve partners early in the

501
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:51,840
campaign campaign can benefit if we find

502
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:55,190
the people who are already caring about

503
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,439
that stuff and using trusted messengers

504
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:01,529
this idea is quite devious actually find

505
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,389
people who are trusted right perhaps

506
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:05,429
people who already prolific in your

507
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:07,678
organization they have power to speak

508
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:09,509
out and get them to deliver the message

509
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,970
of security or health or whatever it

510
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:13,649
might be and then this last thing they

511
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,169
said is something we often ignore

512
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:19,649
ensure the availability of community

513
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:22,830
resources health change campaigns they

514
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:26,879
don't try and make people like all use

515
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,090
condoms or not inject themselves needles

516
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:28,530
or

517
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,600
do any of these bad behaviors if they

518
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:32,730
don't have an available alternative you

519
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,990
don't have the resources to actually do

520
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,400
that other thing you can't tell

521
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:38,340
everybody to use a condom

522
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,740
there's no condoms available and

523
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,139
therefore in security we can take a good

524
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,180
lesson from this we shouldn't try and

525
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,940
make people do the secure thing if we

526
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,380
don't make that available to them so

527
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,080
what do we do if we've got nothing

528
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,510
you've got no resources no one's behind

529
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,600
you on this idea well you be the change

530
00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:00,000
you want to see in the world most red

531
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,939
team's most engagement programs they

532
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,650
start with this very simple idea go do

533
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,590
something go demonstrate go hack

534
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,390
something that will create momentum for

535
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,310
you and then once you have that momentum

536
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,960
you can build a program from it but the

537
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:17,520
idea there is don't fuck it up too bad

538
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,230
and in order to not bug it up too bad

539
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,810
you need something called executive

540
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,630
buy-in I know this seems boring but I

541
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:27,360
bet we all say this all the time but we

542
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,460
don't realize what it really means most

543
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,100
people may think that executive buy-in

544
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:36,060
is this idea that someone who has power

545
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:38,490
may be an executive has said yes you can

546
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,960
do this but that's not executive I

547
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,170
that's permission from somebody

548
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:45,000
executive buy-in the real executive buy

549
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:47,790
it is that anybody who might have an

550
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,400
interest in D railing or anyone whose

551
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,200
toes you might step on they all already

552
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,940
agree with you that means you can go

553
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,280
accomplish the thing you want because

554
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,660
everybody's already on your side there's

555
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,270
a lot of people you might need to make

556
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:05,010
friends with to accomplish anything in

557
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:07,379
security starting with your target

558
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,300
especially for a red team yeah go get

559
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,820
cozy with them no one likes to be told

560
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,110
that their baby is ugly so you gotta do

561
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,399
a lot of pre-work to make them feel

562
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,909
comfortable with the fact that you're

563
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,340
about to go poke them pretty badly

564
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:22,759
that's what she said

565
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:25,249
yeah and you also need to probably if

566
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:26,629
you wanna like message out something you

567
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:27,830
probably want to go talk to the people

568
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:31,399
and there's gonna be a recurring theme

569
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:34,039
here whose job it already is to do that

570
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,779
thing there's someone's it's their job

571
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:37,249
to communicate to the company don't

572
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:38,950
start communicating to the whole company

573
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:42,080
without talking to them first

574
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:44,149
if they even let you it's often a a

575
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,158
gating function where someone can't

576
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:47,989
email the whole thing if they're good at

577
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,610
their job you actually can't do that but

578
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,840
you know sometimes we have the access we

579
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,908
need to do things like that

580
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,970
and there's other right the learning

581
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:57,440
team the people who teach people you

582
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,759
can't run around saying you want to

583
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,070
teach people something if you don't talk

584
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:05,360
to the people whose job it already is or

585
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,879
onboarding making sure that you can

586
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,100
drive home this message that security is

587
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:12,918
part of your company culture because

588
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,570
like any good campaign in this world

589
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:17,539
it's good to get them when they're young

590
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,399
right yeah and that includes at the

591
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:20,570
company that first day man it's powerful

592
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:23,119
it's not something that we should ignore

593
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,980
and of course you also need to go talk

594
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,139
to designs to make things pretty talk to

595
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,350
the event planners talk to procurement

596
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:33,709
you need a lot of friends to succeed

597
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:37,100
executive buy-in is largely a social

598
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,289
engineering operation you have to figure

599
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:43,580
out and enumerate all of these different

600
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:45,740
people so that you can then go exploit

601
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,240
them and it might not sound sexy but

602
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,919
going and having a meeting with the

603
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,399
right people and getting them to buy

604
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,499
into your idea is a real exploit and

605
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,178
it's a powerful one because you might

606
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:59,809
actually accomplish something if you do

607
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:01,700
this enough and then of course there's

608
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:03,740
that last part escalation right popping

609
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,169
one box isn't enough you need everybody

610
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,789
so you take one person buying into your

611
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:09,289
idea and you pivot off of it and you go

612
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:11,860
to other people and you get more people

613
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:11,860
to buy into it

614
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,659
so what does this actually look like in

615
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,720
practice what if you wanted security

616
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:25,710
integrated directly into your core

617
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,810
central employee content platform this

618
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,120
was the experience that I had the first

619
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:33,780
time combining Red Team and security

620
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:38,399
engagement efforts I think thank you

621
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:42,720
David MVP up in the front row here thank

622
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:47,640
you uh sorry sorry got so distracted by

623
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:50,340
dual core need to compose myself so our

624
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:54,720
red team at the time had a goal of

625
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:56,879
writing this engagement using certain

626
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,510
exploit that they had found out I also

627
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,980
had a different operation at the time

628
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:06,300
trying to gain access to a core central

629
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,700
communications platform for the company

630
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,310
that I worked at but we didn't want to

631
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,860
just you know do any old red team

632
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:16,139
campaign and I needed evidence to prove

633
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,939
that I needed access to this tool so we

634
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,970
sat down to make this phishing risk

635
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:24,120
model so we looked at all the assets

636
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,980
this is not a you know all-inclusive

637
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,340
list of any assets that a company might

638
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,230
care about but mere just some examples

639
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,970
and we picked the one that we knew would

640
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:36,120
be most impactful for our organization

641
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:38,250
next we looked at all the tools within

642
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,590
our environment and which tools would

643
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,220
give us access to that asset and whether

644
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,480
or not they were protected by MFA or 2fa

645
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,790
next when crafting our social

646
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,010
engineering and phishing campaign we

647
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:51,990
looked at the you know exact action that

648
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,240
would give us access to that tool and

649
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:56,880
made sure that it was matched up really

650
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,120
well and then last made sure that our

651
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,090
target was you know the user group that

652
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,370
would use that tool and grant us access

653
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:07,379
and there's you know general

654
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:10,919
susceptibility to phishing and social

655
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,230
engineering another way of looking at

656
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,210
this let's say I wanted details of a

657
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:18,590
pending acquisition for my company I

658
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:21,360
might send a targeted phishing campaign

659
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:24,730
to get chrome plug-in permissions to

660
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,918
grant desktop capture to the legal teams

661
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,809
browser probably have a light high

662
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:31,660
likelihood of success with this campaign

663
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:35,440
what I don't do is fish to capture

664
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,450
credentials why because their gmail is

665
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,640
protected by two-factor authentication I

666
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:43,510
have a low likelihood of success running

667
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:45,400
that campaign so what did we end up

668
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:47,890
doing a little bit of oauth fishing

669
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,890
before it was cool at that time we had

670
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,419
the ability to customize our roth page

671
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,280
to make it look like it was coming from

672
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:56,140
within our organization we did the

673
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,620
responsible thing over recording into

674
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:04,510
Google after this time but we got some

675
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:06,639
pretty gnarly permissions in addition to

676
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:09,010
the Red Team campaign that we had going

677
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,940
at this time I had my own operation in

678
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:15,100
play for entire six months when I joined

679
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:17,260
the company and learned that it wasn't

680
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,719
going to be so easy to gain access this

681
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:28,929
tool that I viewed as critical for

682
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:35,500
security engagement even David it's okay

683
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:38,919
it's okay I started my own executive

684
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,169
buying campaign starting with the

685
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:43,809
highest ranking member of the company

686
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:46,270
that I had access to selling them on my

687
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:47,950
vision and getting the meeting with the

688
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:51,340
next biggest person within the company

689
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:53,380
so on and so forth and so until I got

690
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,520
blocked and then I did a little bit of

691
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,500
digging a little bit of reconnaissance

692
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,059
and learned that one of the executives

693
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,950
who had a hard time getting on their

694
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:03,129
calendar usually had their morning

695
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:06,040
meetings available and a penchant for a

696
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,660
specific breakfast sandwich entered the

697
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:11,440
best social engineering - of all time

698
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:13,629
the Egg McMuffin got that meeting with

699
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,560
them got their buy-in and then made some

700
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:18,100
other friends along the way

701
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,469
the design team procurement internal

702
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,239
comms because I learned they were also

703
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,009
blocked from using this tool so my

704
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,350
success was going to be their success

705
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,330
until I felt like I had met with every

706
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:31,659
single person in the company except for

707
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:33,489
the CEO and I leveraged the results from

708
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:36,159
the red team campaign to get that

709
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:38,049
meeting and when I did I you know

710
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,270
presented the problem and then the

711
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,429
immediate solution which was giving me

712
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:47,530
access to that tool and they agreed

713
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:51,300
immediately my bounty propagating and

714
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:53,860
security content on our core platform I

715
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,200
celebrated as one does with some

716
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,870
champagne popping on the roof but then

717
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:02,049
also got to do some really you know fun

718
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:05,680
creative innovative micro learning on

719
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:08,980
our core platform how does this all sum

720
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,160
up you know keeping our hat back to the

721
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,760
boat World Health Organization we have a

722
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,960
behavioral change campaign a clear goal

723
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,730
reducing employee susceptibility to

724
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,520
OAuth phishing attacks

725
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:24,850
gaining access to the best communication

726
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,040
tool to change behaviors and having one

727
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:29,370
to remeasure Ville simulation impact

728
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,440
what we're doing measuring behavior

729
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:35,080
looking at how many employees gave us a

730
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,420
xoauth grants you know gaining access

731
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,940
support and funding for using this

732
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,550
internal tool and then reducing overall

733
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,740
susceptibility to OAuth and other social

734
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,540
engineering attacks and then for doing

735
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,129
and communicating we had a really great

736
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,920
Red Team read out targeted training

737
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:53,140
company-wide marketing of our attack and

738
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,000
our remediation efforts and then

739
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,970
continuous retesting to measure our

740
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,070
change and our end results when that

741
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,330
really noisy OAuth attack went out

742
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,760
around the world

743
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:05,890
our employees caught it in ten seconds

744
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,920
we were the first company to report it

745
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:11,350
to Google 70% of our reported fishes end

746
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,750
up being real fishes that means that our

747
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:16,569
employees were so good at spotting real

748
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:19,230
phishing attacks our company and when we

749
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:21,310
did a campaign with a binary execution

750
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:26,080
100% of the people that we targeted

751
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:28,480
reported it to our team this is actually

752
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,650
a pretty great success story and it

753
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:38,380
comes down to a really core idea and the

754
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:41,260
goal here was to use the V app and we're

755
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:43,870
not naming the company but like it's the

756
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,570
app that is the company if you can ever

757
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:49,029
do that if you can ever figure out like

758
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:51,430
how to place security how to place

759
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,960
things that you want people to know

760
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,359
about

761
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,500
security education messaging whatever it

762
00:36:54,359 --> 00:37:00,000
is into the most central integrated

763
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,800
thing that the company has right if

764
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,480
you're Facebook you poke you get it

765
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,250
integrated into the internal Facebook

766
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,560
thing if you're snapchat you get it

767
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,990
integrate it into snapchat itself if

768
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,650
you're Pandora you play songs about

769
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,279
security

770
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:16,770
I don't know but using whatever that

771
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,630
place that people already go to as your

772
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,450
messaging platform is going to be the

773
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,460
most powerful thing and we as security

774
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:26,189
practitioners should maybe stop trying

775
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,500
to reinvent the wheel everywhere this

776
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,280
idea already exists and we talk about it

777
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,109
all the time when we talk about

778
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,960
offensive operations this idea of living

779
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:36,779
off the land which if you're unfamiliar

780
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,050
it means don't drop a bunch of exploit

781
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,920
toolkit on a system when you get access

782
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:45,780
to it because that's gonna get detected

783
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,910
but instead use the things that are

784
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,440
already existing in the environment to

785
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:53,368
move laterally to move your privileges

786
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:58,140
up it's important for us to think about

787
00:37:53,369 --> 00:38:01,320
how we approach putting security in

788
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:03,509
other places and one idea that we might

789
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,210
want to be aware of is the

790
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,730
dunning-kruger effect and this is a

791
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:12,720
psychological principle in which we're

792
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:16,080
when we try something new we go from not

793
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,689
being skilled at all to being a little

794
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:22,020
bit skilled and we suddenly think we're

795
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:25,589
the freakin best at it but man I got all

796
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:26,940
these new skills and actually over time

797
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:29,099
maybe you experienced this in your

798
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,720
career as a security professional but we

799
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,089
definitely I know we're all really

800
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,189
really smart right security people so

801
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:37,320
smarmy not on computers but we're not

802
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,150
that great at everything else and unless

803
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,619
we really put that time into learning

804
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:45,570
that we're probably not going to be and

805
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:48,869
the thing that will give us the biggest

806
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:50,990
advantage is diversifying the types of

807
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:54,570
people we allow into security

808
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:56,759
diversifying the skillsets that we use

809
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:59,160
an approach rather than thinking that we

810
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:03,770
as an industry can do everything all on

811
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:06,420
our own leveraging design leveraging

812
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:10,690
behavioral psychology

813
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:12,400
leveraging marketing sales people who

814
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,800
have skill sets that are different than

815
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,510
ours because we will never get security

816
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,640
into the places it needs to be and

817
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:22,230
people will never care about it if we

818
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,129
stay in this little camp that's just us

819
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,720
and then that's the end of the

820
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,420
presentation and if you have any

821
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,680
questions we'll try and answer them so

822
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,680
ask them or don't

823
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:40,670
then don't I guess alright that's the

824
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:47,179
end pot thank you bye

825
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:47,179
[Applause]

826
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,400
Oh
