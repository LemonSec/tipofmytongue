1
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,560
awesome alright my name is Gabrielle

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,180
Hempel this is hacking humans addressing

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,650
vulnerabilities in the advancing medical

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,510
device landscape so the first question

5
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,589
is usually how did I end up here a

6
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,610
couple weird things happened to kind of

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:43,050
bring this intersection of medical and

8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,000
cybersecurity to life so weird thing

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,860
number one I studied neuroscience and

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,629
psychology and undergrad I worked in

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,360
neurobiology for a while and then worked

12
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:54,360
in pharma after graduating and I worked

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,230
with a lot of medical devices in a lot

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,789
of just patient specific things and kind

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,190
of fell down that InfoSec rabbit hole

16
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,480
once I started working with medical

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,310
devices because I wanted to figure out

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,500
why they were so vulnerable so first

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,850
let's talk about connected devices the

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,380
Internet of Things is comprised of

21
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,470
devices that possess Internet

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,210
connectivity sensors electronics etc and

23
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,490
that use the internet to communicate and

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,399
interact with other devices most of the

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,979
times these devices can be remotely

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,810
monitored and controlled they can be

27
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,299
segmented with a variety of categories

28
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,880
included including consumer commercial

29
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,470
and industrial applications consumer

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,210
applications are created for consumer

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,970
use and can include connected vehicles

32
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,908
smart home devices wearable technology

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,369
ie fitbit's or Apple watches connected

34
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,680
healthcare technology which we'll be

35
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,950
discussing here and appliances that have

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,000
remote monitoring capabilities

37
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,060
commercial applications are also

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,259
comprised largely of medical devices

39
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,329
these devices are generally used for

40
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,820
data collection remote health monitoring

41
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,860
and emergency notification can also

42
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,139
include transportation system controls

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,350
vehicle to everything communication in

44
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,759
building and home automation

45
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,318
finally industrial applications of IOT

46
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,359
devices can include manufacturing

47
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:22,510
devices especially control systems

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:31,240
and Agricultural devices I had to

49
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:33,160
include Patrick so alright so now let's

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,660
talk the Internet of medical things

51
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,090
it's basically IOT but make it

52
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,710
healthcare internet of medical things is

53
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,959
a connected system of medical devices

54
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,820
and apps that collect medical data that

55
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,400
is then provided to information systems

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,560
through networks a lot of times these

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,020
devices enable remote health monitoring

58
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,550
and emergency notification and can range

59
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,680
from heart rate monitors and internal

60
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,709
defibrillator implants aka items used

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,630
directly on a person or smart beds and

62
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:06,190
diagnostic machines which are items used

63
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:07,690
to and to aid a patient's care so why

64
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,730
the fuss of our medical devices and

65
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,130
their connectivity they have become such

66
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,109
an integral part of our healthcare tech

67
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,959
landscape that the numbers are pretty

68
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,489
staggering 6.7 million people in the

69
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,670
United States each year on average

70
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,959
receive implantable medical devices

71
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,208
aside from that hospitals tend to have

72
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,519
10 to 15 connected devices per bed in

73
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:30,549
their facilities the problem with this

74
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,470
is that devices boast the latest smart

75
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:34,750
technology and enable connectivity with

76
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,310
other devices however this generally

77
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,930
leaves them vulnerable to threats and

78
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,530
people are starting to notice and

79
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,900
exploit that medical device recalls

80
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,970
increased 126 percent just in the first

81
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,019
quarter of 2018 and a lot of these

82
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,750
recalls were due to security

83
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,459
vulnerabilities and threats most of the

84
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,400
weaknesses were discovered by government

85
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,170
entities and academic institutions the

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
FDA is just now beginning to release

87
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,250
preliminary guidance to both assess

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,560
impact and establish regulations for

89
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,049
these devices let's dive in a little bit

90
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,489
deeper and disclose and discuss how

91
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,100
vulnerabilities and medical devices

92
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,420
range from rudimentary to advanced how

93
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,370
this can endanger both patient

94
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,679
information and safety and how we can

95
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,089
devise a more rigid system to diminish

96
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,019
the threat of the attacks

97
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:21,190
[Music]

98
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,570
first things first why should we even

99
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,820
use these devices if they're so

100
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,940
vulnerable according to Goldman Sachs

101
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,130
connected medical devices say the

102
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,230
us on average 300 billion dollars in

103
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,820
healthcare per year they increase

104
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,950
revenue and decrease costs which is

105
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,200
ideal and provide access to better and

106
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,610
new types of information that a patient

107
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,930
either may not have had access to

108
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,330
previously or hadn't had a way to

109
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,890
measure this in turn leads to more

110
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,469
accurate underwriting and new pricing

111
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,090
models for consumers the devices will

112
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,590
also help improve the quality of life

113
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,840
for many of the patients that use them

114
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,150
remote monitoring is made possible by

115
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,830
connected medical devices and allows

116
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,320
healthcare providers to capture patient

117
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,729
data instantaneously as well as allow

118
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,080
the patient to live their life more

119
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:08,100
normally than they previously may have

120
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:09,990
been able to so first let's talk about

121
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,300
implantable devices this is the

122
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,580
Medtronic CareLink 29 t which is the

123
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,580
software for an internal defibrillator

124
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,930
this works similarly to a pacemaker the

125
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,700
manufacturers how to software deployment

126
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,610
network that allowed for the download of

127
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,750
new software directly to the pacemaker

128
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,400
however security researchers found

129
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,630
vulnerabilities in which an individual

130
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,810
could pretty easily update the

131
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,940
programmer with a third party software

132
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,680
the FDA issued a bulletin disabling

133
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,270
Hestia and requiring manual updates

134
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,270
until the vulnerability could be fixed

135
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,450
the vulnerability was discovered in

136
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,910
publicized by Billy Rios and Jonathan

137
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,440
butts from white scope LLC they

138
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,880
uncovered a chain of vulnerabilities in

139
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,500
Medtronic sin-free structure that an

140
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,870
attacker could exploit to control

141
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,730
implanted peacemakers remotely deliver

142
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,800
shocks patients don't need or withhold

143
00:05:53,730 --> 00:06:02,790
ones they do and essentially cause real

144
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:04,410
harm in essence the 20 90s is a VPN to

145
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,030
securely download its updates but

146
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,620
doesn't verify that it's still connected

147
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,989
to the VPN before downloading the

148
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,630
updates the device will establish an

149
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:15,330
encapsulated IP based VPN connection to

150
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,740
a Medtronic hosted update network once

151
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,219
established it makes a request to an

152
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,160
HTTP non TLS server across the VPN which

153
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,180
responds and provides the updates

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,250
however the programmer side service

155
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,169
responsible for this HTTP request

156
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,880
doesn't check to make sure it's still

157
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:34,650
connected to the VPN before actually

158
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:36,479
making the request this could be

159
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,239
exploited if an attacker terminated the

160
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,820
VPN and intercepted the HTTP request and

161
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:47,150
responded with malicious update

162
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:49,159
via a man-in-the-middle attack Medtronic

163
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,590
disabled the network based software

164
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,860
update mechanism including the VPN and

165
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,570
HTTP sub services users were instructed

166
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,420
to obtain and apply updates via

167
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,159
controlled USB devices it was also

168
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,050
recommended that users minimize network

169
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,910
exposure for all control system devices

170
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:10,460
and ensure that they were not accessible

171
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:12,110
from the internet next we have infusion

172
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,729
pumps which are used to deliver medicine

173
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,680
and controlled doses in hospital

174
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,150
settings we're specifically going to

175
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,370
talk about the Smith's medical med

176
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,630
fusion wireless infusion pump but

177
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,380
similar vulnerabilities have been

178
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,820
founded nearly identical devices it was

179
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,469
discovered that remote attackers could

180
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,570
gain access to both the communication

181
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,370
and therapeutic modules there were

182
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,810
various attack vectors ez buffer

183
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,390
overflows due to a lack of verification

184
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,850
of input buffer size hard-coded

185
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:43,640

186
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:46,040
improper certificate validation Scott

187
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,200
guy you a security researcher identified

188
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:55,040
a handful of ulnar abilities in this med

189
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:56,450
fusion infusion pump in short the pumps

190
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,400
are used to deliver small doses of

191
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,400
medication and acute care settings a

192
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,780
third-party component in this pump did

193
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,550
not verify the buffer input size prior

194
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,950
to copying leading to a buffer overflow

195
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,260
and allowing a remote code execution on

196
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,969
the target device while a difficult

197
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,039
exploitation it was potentially

198
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,810
extremely malicious a third-party

199
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,730
component used in the pump read the

200
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,610
memory out of bounds which caused the

201
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,170
communication module to crash the pump

202
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,940
which left with its default network

203
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,560
configuration used hard-coded

204
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,540
credentials to establish a wireless

205
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,159
connection automatically even if

206
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,159
Ethernet was connected and active

207
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,659
we also see improper access control on a

208
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,000
device the FTP server on the pump

209
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,039
doesn't require authentication the

210
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,179
server also contains hard-coded

211
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,120
credentials which are not fully

212
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,680
initialized telnet on the pump also uses

213
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,240
hard-coded credentials which could be

214
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,029
exploited if the pump was configured to

215
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,800
allow external communications the

216
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,120
infusion pumps did not validate the

217
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,109
hosts certificate which left it

218
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:03,589
vulnerable to men in the middle attack

219
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,910
and then my favorite the infusion pump

220
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:06,470
it stored some passwords in the

221
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,329
configuration file which are easily

222
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:15,380
accessible if the pump was configured to

223
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:16,760
allow external communications Smiths

224
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,620
released updates to mitigate these

225
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,080
vulnerabilities but also suggested that

226
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,330
serve users applied defective measures

227
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,279
or defensive measures

228
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,380
these include assigning static IP

229
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,310
addresses to the pump monitoring network

230
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,570
activity for rogue DNS and DHCP servers

231
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,250
ensuring Network segments are segmented

232
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,250
from other Hospital and medical

233
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,110
technology infrastructure using VLANs

234
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:45,110
practicing password hygiene and

235
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:46,610
performing routine evaluations so in

236
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,660
general there's many connected devices

237
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,339
within hospitals

238
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,279
these include imaging systems like

239
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:54,350
ultrasound machines MRI PET CT scans and

240
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,839
exterior machines treatment equipment

241
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,360
like infusion pumps lasers in surgical

242
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,370
machinery life supporting devices like

243
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,800
ventilators anaesthetic equipment and

244
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,470
dialysis machines and medical monitors

245
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,380
like oh - blood pressure ECG and EEG

246
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,390
machines most of these don't have any

247
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,029
sort of and here in an evite antivirus

248
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,830
in place which poses a problem this can

249
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:21,830
allow malware to spread quickly between

250
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:23,600
connected devices so with all these

251
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,330
dangers wire connected hospitals and

252
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,500
medical devices a good thing connected

253
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,020
devices like the ones mentioned

254
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,459
previously substantially reduce the

255
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,920
amount of time it takes to read and

256
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:36,170
record vitals and other information each

257
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,240
patient in the hospital has on average 3

258
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,599
to 6 medical monitoring devices attached

259
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,600
to them

260
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:47,819
so what kinds of incidents are plaguing

261
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,350
hospitals and medical systems 2018 was a

262
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,900
record-breaking year for data breaches

263
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,600
in health care alone since October 2009

264
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,000
there's been disclosure of almost 195

265
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,650
million health care records this equates

266
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,970
to affecting fifty nine point eight

267
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,970
percent of the United States population

268
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,330
so what are solutions to these

269
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,579
vulnerabilities the FDA issued guidance

270
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,140
both pre and post-market to offer

271
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,660
recommendations for management of

272
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,640
medical device security risks mitre

273
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,060
unveiled a mitre medical device security

274
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,100
PlayBook in October 2018 this enables

275
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,750
healthcare organizations to plan for and

276
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,090
respond to incidents and develop a

277
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,800
preparedness and response framework the

278
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,020
FDA is also leveraging the NIST

279
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,990
cybersecurity framework it's composed of

280
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:38,010
five core functions identify protect

281
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,600
detect respond and recover they also

282
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,790
have been assembling information sharing

283
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,920
analysis organizations in holding forums

284
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,449
and finally they've been partnering with

285
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,579
the Department of Homeland Security in

286
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,580
order in order to mitigate wider attacks

287
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:55,110
so first let's talk about the FDA issued

288
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,550
guidance the agency developed this

289
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,930
guidance as a result of an executive

290
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,540
order that was aimed at strengthening

291
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,180
national security economic stability and

292
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,680
public health and safety this guidance

293
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,050
is generally for medical device

294
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,370
manufacturers and applies to any market

295
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,560
in an distributed medical device

296
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,800
including devices that contain software

297
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,890
in firmware or programmable logic

298
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,040
devices or software that is a medical

299
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,180
device including mobile medical apps

300
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,610
medical devices that are part of an

301
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,979
interoperable system in legacy devices

302
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:33,930
aka devices that are already approved on

303
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:36,360
the market and in use so the FDA

304
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,280
guidance outlines a common vulnerability

305
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,260
scoring system which provides numerical

306
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,970
ratings corresponding to high medium and

307
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,130
low by assessing a number of factors

308
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,690
including the following attack vectors

309
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,170
and whether they're physical local

310
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,430
adjacent network etc the complexity of

311
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,620
the attack whether it's high or low

312
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,180
whether privileges are required to

313
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,430
complete the attack and whether user

314
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,620
interaction is even required the scope

315
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,060
of the vulnerability the impact that an

316
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,450
exploit might have on confidentiality

317
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,250
integrity and availability of data the

318
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,240

undefined

324
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,980
and finally the confidence and the

325
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,599
rapport these factors are weighted and

326
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,430
aggregated into one of the scores on the

327
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,200
vulnerability scoring system once the

328
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,050
vulnerability exploit is rated there's

329
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,459
another side of the investigation

330
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,380
because these devices are used on in for

331
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:37,170
humans we need to assess the severity of

332
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,500
patient harm the FDA provides a scale of

333
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,939
five categories to assess patient harm

334
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,770
we start with negligible which is just

335
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,490
an inconvenience or temporary discomfort

336
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,160
for the patient

337
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,080
minor which might result in temporary

338
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,020
injury or impairment but does not

339
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,360
require medical intervention serious

340
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,949
which results in injury or impairment

341
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,529
requiring professional medical

342
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,029
intervention critical which results in

343
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:02,820
permanent impairment or life-threatening

344
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:09,270
injury and catastrophic which results in

345
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:10,860
patient death it's also necessary to

346
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,439
evaluate the risk of patient harm and

347
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,730
medical device breaches or exploits we

348
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,320
need to determine whether the risk of

349
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,029
patient harm is controlled which is

350
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,850
acceptable or uncontrolled which is

351
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:22,830
unacceptable oftentimes this is done by

352
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,750
assessing a matrix with a combination of

353
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,630
exploit ability and severity of patient

354
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,279
harm a binary determination is

355
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:34,920
recommended by the FDA are you one of

356
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:36,480
the other with no gray areas controlled

357
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,640
risk is present when they're

358
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,490
sufficiently low or acceptable risk of

359
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,150
patient harm due to the vulnerability

360
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,920
manufacturers are asked to perform

361
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,290
device enhancements that will strengthen

362
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,329
security deploy controls for a defense

363
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,310
in depth strategy perform routine

364
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:51,750
updates and patching and submit an

365
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,449
annual report to the FDA if they're

366
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,950
under pre-market approval an example of

367
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,529
controlled risk could be as follows

368
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,540
a manufacturer received a complaint that

369
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:03,360
a gasps blood analyzer has been affected

370
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,099
infected with malware and it's unknown

371
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,800
as to whether the malware could alter

372
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,600
data on the device

373
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,149
once investigated the presence of

374
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,220
malware is confirmed however the malware

375
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:15,350
doesn't result in the manipulation of

376
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,540
unencrypted data stored and running

377
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,100
through the device the device's safety

378
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,569
and performance is not impacted by the

379
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,040
malware and the manufacturer determines

380
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:27,529
that the risk of patient harm is a

381
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,998
controlled risk uncontrolled risk is

382
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,129
present when there's an unacceptable

383
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:33,079
residual risk of patient harm due to

384
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:35,839
insufficient risk mitigations and

385
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:37,670
compensating controls manufacturers

386
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,499
should consider exploit ability of the

387
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,649
vulnerability and severity of patient

388
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:43,369
harm if exploitation is carried out

389
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,230
manufacturers are also asked to

390
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:46,819
remediate uncontrolled risks as quickly

391
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:50,149
as possible and to report them to the

392
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:52,579
FDA an example of uncontrolled risk

393
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,259
could be as follows hospital submits a

394
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:55,849
report that a patient was harmed after a

395
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:58,549
medical device failed to perform as

396
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,689
intended upon investigation it was

397
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:01,279
determined that the medical device

398
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:03,368
malfunctioned as a result of

399
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,959
exploitation of a previously unknown

400
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:07,699
vulnerability in the software the

401
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,679
outcome of the investigation and impact

402
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:11,479
assessment determines that the ex boy in

403
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,759
packs the devices safety innocent

404
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,730
essential performance and could have

405
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,929
contributed to the patient's death a

406
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,309
report is filed in accordance with the

407
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,350
reporting requirements and the

408
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:23,389
manufacturer notified its customers and

409
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:28,639
develops the validated emergency patch

410
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:30,529
to remediate the issue now for part two

411
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,600
of The MITRE playbook my dear which I'm

412
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:34,429
sure you've heard of found after some

413
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,929
research that after a breach health care

414
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:37,819
providers didn't really know with whom

415
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:40,040
to communicate what actions they were

416
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:42,860
supposed to take and what resources were

417
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,299
available to them The MITRE team worked

418
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,249
with the FDA to identify stakeholders

419
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:48,579
and develop a plan for preparedness and

420
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:50,809
incident response

421
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:52,878
the first phase mitre wants us to

422
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:55,009
consider is preparedness secure design

423
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:57,139
of medical devices in question is a huge

424
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,449
concern especially identifying and

425
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:01,610
securing any third-party components that

426
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:03,349
might be part of the device in providing

427
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,659
service layer access during an incident

428
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,809
in order to ensure minimal disruption of

429
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:10,010
clinical ops in a more rapid response

430
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,510
doing an asset inventory and knowing

431
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,579
what is connected to the network is also

432
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,839
a big part of preparedness by

433
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,779
maintaining a baseline set of

434
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,720
information about each medical device

435
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:22,869
the baseline set of information

436
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,029
well better be able to provide an

437
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:28,239
account for and manage devices before

438
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:30,279
during and after an incident hazard

439
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,289
vulnerability analysis is used to assess

440
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:37,600
and identify potential gaps in emergency

441
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:39,460
planning as well therefore an emergency

442
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,199
ops plan is also necessary to describe

443
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,940
how a provider will respond to and

444
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,830
recover from a threat hazard or other

445
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,659
incident building upon this

446
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,000
communication is key during an incident

447
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:50,440
an incident response communications plan

448
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,759
will help with all aspects of

449
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,370
communication during the incident

450
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,399
especially with incident sharing knowing

451
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,928
how incident sensitivities can be shared

452
00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:00,459
incident identification incident

453
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:02,799
notification or how outreach is

454
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,419
initiated situational awareness and

455
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,970
communication templates to streamline

456
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:08,350
the process finally user awareness

457
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,629
training is important in preparedness

458
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,860
for a security incident especially in

459
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:17,590
terms of classification in

460
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:19,949
identification the next phase of the

461
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,059
mitre playbook is detection and analysis

462
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,399
the first part of incident detection

463
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:27,309
analysis is identifying or establishing

464
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:29,500
that an incident has occurred is it an

465
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:31,658
actual incident next we must categorize

466
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,340
and prioritize the incident this is

467
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:35,320
where those charts and skills come in so

468
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,699
we know how severe an incident is and

469
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,110
whether it impacts patient safety or not

470
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,940
once we know the scope of the incident

471
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,309
we have to report oftentimes there are

472
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,679
formal and import informal reporting

473
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,440
obligations that accompany discovery of

474
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,299
an incident analysis will be done once

475
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,769
the initial incident parameters have

476
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,750
been established in order to provide

477
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:57,250
insights on both the vulnerability and

478
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,039
the impact within the healthcare

479
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:04,269
organization finally an documentation

480
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:06,220
will be carried out phase 3 of the mitre

481
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:08,649
playbook is containment eradication and

482
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,720
recovery once an incident is confirmed

483
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,860
response begins oftentimes the

484
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,440
healthcare organization will use a

485
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,059
contain clean and deny strategy and then

486
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,759
monitoring record when cyber security

487
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:20,408
criminal activity is suspected it's

488
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:22,360
important for organizations to perform

489
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,460
effective containment and minimize

490
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,979
impact on health care delivery in or in

491
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,980
other organization

492
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,450
finally phase four is the post activity

493
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,790
phase here we assess lessons learned and

494
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,760
conduct hot wash sessions to elicit

495
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,740
feedback on future responses we will

496
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,420
also engage a forensics investigation at

497
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,440
this point and make any plan updates we

498
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,440
feel necessary for the future

499
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,250
my turn the FTA came together to

500
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,439
streamline and standardize the PlayBook

501
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,880
in the post market guidance they forged

502
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,680
a partnership so that mitre could

503
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,320
provide the FTA with strategic and

504
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,390
technical support they also leveraged

505
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,860
miters expertise across multiple

506
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,870
federally funded research and

507
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,340
development centers an independent

508
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,739
research in the areas of cyber and

509
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,970
homeland security

510
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,430
both groups leveraged the NIST framework

511
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,780
in order to create their plans with the

512
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,190
hopes that the healthcare groups and

513
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,960
device manufacturers will be

514
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,490
well-positioned to manage those

515
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,320
incidents through planning and practice

516
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,210
along with the support and collaboration

517
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:28,510
of manufacturers and regional and

518
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:29,920
national partners so the difference and

519
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,000
responsibilities between these device

520
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,800
manufacturers in a healthcare

521
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,650
organization that might experience an

522
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,149
event firsthand our device manufacturers

523
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,980
need to protect their intellectual

524
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,140
property through a server hardening and

525
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,480
authentication secure devices through

526
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,820
code signing secure boot and platform

527
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,310
hardening protect critical data through

528
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,320
messaging certs encryption and MP ki and

529
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,639
protect their manufacturing integrity

530
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,730
through platform hardening and

531
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,560
authentication healthcare organizations

532
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,450
by contrast need to manage their

533
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,070
contracts and requirements perform

534
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,350
holistic asset reviews and asset

535
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,330
management manage and mitigate risk and

536
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,730
detect anomalies and network security in

537
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,399
security gateways both need to come

538
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,110
together to ensure secure communication

539
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:16,900
and access through authentication and

540
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:18,510
access management so the key takeaways

541
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,770
of this presentation are as follows

542
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,870
medical device technology is progressing

543
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,300
faster than research on vulnerabilities

544
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,189
for these devices we need to begin to

545
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,110
develop and implement a concrete plan

546
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,000
for mitigation of risks to both patients

547
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,969
and information in the healthcare system

548
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,930
and the FDA and mitre guidance is a step

549
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,970
in the right direction

550
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:43,530
toward a universal program for

551
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:43,530
leveraging these risks thank you

552
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,720
