1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,410
ready morning everybody thanks for

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,610
coming I know it's hard to get up after

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,610
partying so hard last night

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,660
and my name is rich Rumble a little bit

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,480
about me I'm curious and Naughty by

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,670
Nature and certifiable

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,789
I've even gotten certified I'm driven I

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,920
am humble if I do say so myself and I

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:34,110
have a great sense of humor and my mom

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,550
told me so so brief intro into RFID I'm

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,820
not going to get into the weeds too much

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,500
about the protocols or anything you need

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,750
to really understand other than it is

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,809
super easy to clone badges and these

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:51,719
days sure sorry about that so use RFID

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,530
all the time in your hotel bed your work

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,539
badge even the running bibs when you go

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,660
to a marathon often you'll find that

19
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,609
they are equipped with an rfid reader so

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,989
that when you cross the start line and

21
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,659
the finish line they can keep track of

22
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,860
you again these are some of the details

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:15,390
of RFID like what the ranges are on

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:18,210
reading them and the different tags you

25
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,580
find them reading the I'm sorry the the

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,679
animal tags the badge tags window tag

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,700
does anybody have a Mike's or a crew car

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,770
wash tag anybody familiar with the car

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,750
wash tag there you go

30
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,250
and those read at a different range and

31
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,570
they're much much better actually so

32
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,240
near field communication I'm going to

33
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,279
talk about that briefly now it's what

34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,169
you use in your phone for Apple pay

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,950
Google pay it's very passive and it's

36
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,439
often what the badge readers or the new

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,759
the new access control systems are

38
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,809
moving to these they're still very short

39
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,790
distances

40
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,229
Bluetooth is something that is not

41
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,119
really used in RFID or badge reading or

42
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,780
authentication but I wanted to mention

43
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,120
some interesting facts I found out while

44
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,740
researching this topic you are tire

45
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,000
pressure sensors in your car

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,010
actually use a Bluetooth signal and you

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,500
basically have four unique trackers in

48
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,780
your car that could be used to track you

49
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,180
all over town if someone were to equip

50
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,010
your town with enough readers all over

51
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,770
the place you could actually track

52
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,290
someone using that so I thought that was

53
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,730
a little interesting how your phone

54
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,049
gives off a Bluetooth signal so you

55
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,410
could track someone by your phone I'm

56
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:43,500
sure that's all been covered prior so

57
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,060
since my talk is on RFID badge skimming

58
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,920
I wanted to talk about a few people who

59
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,700
have done some great work in the area

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,309
and and inspired me to do the same or do

61
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:58,440
something similar over here on the right

62
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:02,340
you see the tastic RFID thief what he

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,600
did was Francis Brown took a RFID reader

64
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,980
it's usually what you find in the

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,930
parking garage it's about a foot in diet

66
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,970
or you know in size either way its

67
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,610
square and you see the large coil of

68
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,920
wire there that reads your card from

69
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,750
about three feet so he thought it would

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,200
be a good idea to put that in his

71
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,600
man-bag slash man purse and walk around

72
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,220
next to people and read badges without

73
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,570
having to get so close that it's almost

74
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,790
the game of grab-ass if you will because

75
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,980
you usually do have to be very close to

76
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:40,109
people and they don't like you like you

77
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:42,359
know doing such things some other ID

78
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,790
ideas that people have had are these two

79
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,630
devices you see at the bottom one in the

80
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,760
middle is the Wi-Fi tool it's a great

81
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,620
little tool it basically does the same

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,840
thing that Francis did with his reader

83
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,770
although in the middle of his reader you

84
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,020
can see he put an Arduino reader and a

85
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,470
small memory card again watch his talk

86
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:08,430
it's it's it's very good so the Wi-Fi

87
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,440
tool will vampire tap into the the

88
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,910
innards though the wires that run from

89
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:17,010
the reader to the controller and the the

90
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,380
wires that talk from the reader to the

91
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,779
controller are not encrypted they use a

92
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,880
Weigand protocol which is essentially a

93
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:27,059
plaintext protocol it's very well

94
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,469
understood and ease

95
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,190
to to tap into and and and get the data

96
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,050
off of it

97
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,480
the tool to the left is called the

98
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,610
bleakie so instead of using Wi-Fi to

99
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,160
communicate to this tool you would use

100
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,250
bluetooth and the next slide I'll kind

101
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,470
of show you what that tool looks like so

102
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,050
this is another reader it's a little

103
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,970
smaller and someone has basically taken

104
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,610
the wires and you can see how they push

105
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,280
them down through these little will call

106
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,350
them vampire taps and these dig into the

107
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,520
wire and are making contact with the

108
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:06,900
wire and as a badge is read you can it

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,030
will start to write down what the the

110
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,590
number of the badge was and you could

111
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,419
walk by with your phone after it's

112
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:16,020
stored up these badges and you could

113
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:18,150
download over bluetooth all the badges

114
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,620
that were read and you can actually send

115
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,159
a signal to the phone with this little

116
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:26,460
app you see on the right this can replay

117
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,610
the badges it can again download them

118
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,219
for you to then place in a cloner and

119
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,490
you could clone the badge so this is

120
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,890
what inspired some of this talk here

121
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,350
there were some of these devices and

122
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:43,770
again the communication is plaintext

123
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:45,330
from the badge reader to the controller

124
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,710
so I just want to reiterate that that

125
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:51,479
will come up later again acknowledging

126
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,150
some previous work so as far back as

127
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,150
2003 hackers have been cloning badges

128
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,789
and making it easy for the public to do

129
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,888
it Chris pageant and these other two

130
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:04,700
gentlemen at the top they even showed

131
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:07,050
their congressman how easy it was to

132
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,349
clone the the badges for the government

133
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,419
and they were up in arms back then about

134
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,639
it and some changes were made and some

135
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:18,719
improvements were made to the cards as a

136
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,760
result and I wanted to call out some of

137
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,760
these other people as inspiration for me

138
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:27,919
and this talk and I'm sure I'm missing

139
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:31,289
quite a few so our idea started with

140
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,570
going to a client's engagement we're

141
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,880
doing a follow up engagement not related

142
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,310
to RFID or pin test or I'm sorry

143
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,529
physical pin testing at all and the

144
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,199
client on day two of our

145
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:45,179
returned their the clients RFID badge

146
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,999
readers had changed and we took note of

147
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:50,248
it and we asked the client you know why

148
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:52,109
did you change your readers who upgraded

149
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:55,589
them and what's the reasoning and they

150
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:57,659
actually had no idea they didn't control

151
00:06:55,589 --> 00:07:00,359
the readers they were just one tenant of

152
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:03,409
many in a building so the the readers

153
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:06,359
are actually controlled by the building

154
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:09,989
what do you call it the yeah the

155
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:12,089
property management and so they were

156
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:13,638
just badging in blindly and just going

157
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:15,749
upstairs even though they're bad readers

158
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,119
changed and nobody informed them that

159
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:23,099
they were changing so this this gave us

160
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:25,679
an idea and so with the with the readers

161
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,498
notice or I'm sorry with the employees

162
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:30,779
notice if the readers changed again and

163
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:32,099
so we had a light bulb moment and we

164
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,829
asked the client please please please

165
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,239
can we can we can we make some skimmers

166
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,939
for your badge readers in there like

167
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:41,339
yeah but we don't want you to actually

168
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:46,259
get the IDs we don't want you to

169
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:48,539
actually get the numbers so in these the

170
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,999
memory cards that we were going to use

171
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,068
there's a config file and in that config

172
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:55,319
file you tella what baud rate to expect

173
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:57,599
what rate of data is going to come to

174
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,279
that and if you give it the wrong baud

175
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,569
rate you will get a bunch of gibberish

176
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:05,429
but it will put it at it will do it line

177
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:08,219
by line so you can count the lines

178
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:10,018
rather than counting you know that we're

179
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:11,789
getting the actual card data so we're

180
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:14,969
getting gibberish but we're getting

181
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:17,369
gibberish once per line and so that's

182
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:19,739
how we counted how many people were

183
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:22,229
coming into the building or using the

184
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:25,018
reader without actually getting the data

185
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:27,329
off of it and the clients we're happy

186
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,279
with that that solution well that took

187
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:32,009
us actually a couple minutes to to

188
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,049
figure out how to do on Brian Krebs I'm

189
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:37,740
sure you've seen ATM skimmers that are

190
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:41,549
similar to this they just fit over the

191
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,589
the unit and your badge or your I'm

192
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:45,559
sorry your credit card is read twice

193
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:50,100
so once by the unit and then once by the

194
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:52,529
the actual reader the ATM behind it and

195
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,030
then we saw this one on Krebs in at

196
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:57,439
really blew our mind

197
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:01,310
yeah that's what I said

198
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:06,170
and so they basically took a laptop and

199
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:08,209
made entire and housing over the the ATM

200
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,099
reader they took a laptop and readers

201
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,350
and they mimicked what was gonna happen

202
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,730
on the screen behind it once you put

203
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,580
your card in and once you put your PIN

204
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,040
in and there's cellular there's a cell

205
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,650
phone also up in all those electronics

206
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,439
that sends your phone or I'm sorry your

207
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,260
card over the phone real time to the

208
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,500
attackers so they can be across the

209
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,610
world and know what your credit card was

210
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,240
instantly but this was somewhere in

211
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,070
Brazil I believe and yeah that that was

212
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,880
this is really the inspiration for for

213
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:43,910
our our card readers so we called this

214
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,590
project cosplay because we were just

215
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:49,130
making a little costume it seemed like

216
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:54,080
for the badge readers so what we came up

217
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:56,420
with was $15 we could get off of ebay a

218
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,910
card reader and we could to make a mold

219
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,890
of the card reader and essentially we

220
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,170
made a mold of it made a plaster

221
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,850
positive we we poured in the mold some

222
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,449
plaster and we built up around the

223
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:11,150
plaster and around the plaster we put

224
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:13,730
some ABS plastic and made another mold

225
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:17,750
of that and here in a second you'll see

226
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:21,830
what we kind of came up with so this is

227
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:24,410
our first attempt at making a cloned

228
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:28,370
badge reader you can ignore the sticker

229
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:32,300
on there that's just stuff we stick all

230
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:34,670
around the office but this was this was

231
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,310
the reader and we got some really good

232
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,319
success with this clients did not bat an

233
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,000
eye these were the readers they were

234
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,780
using these are the new readers they had

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,920
these really old grey ones that really

236
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,500
look a lot different than what what

237
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,660
these do so this was the reader we came

238
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,000
up with the client was pretty pleased

239
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:56,030
with it you can't tell from this picture

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,940
but there is about a quarter inch gap

241
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,770
between the the back of this reader and

242
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,110
and the actual reader so you can fit all

243
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,939
the electronics you need to and after

244
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,990
this talk I'll be over here to the right

245
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,610
of the

246
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,050
towards the windows and you guys can

247
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,640
come up and see all the electronics and

248
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,880
how small everything is and how it all

249
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,790
fits in inside these readers so please

250
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,260
see me after the show then we had to

251
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,849
make another cover because the client

252
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,560
thought this was too effective we left

253
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:28,530
it up there for about 48 hours and they

254
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,930
were not that pleased so they thought

255
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,490
okay if the readers change again then

256
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,099
they're sure to notice somebody's bound

257
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,320
a tournament or somebody's bound to

258
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,670
hesitate so they asked us if we could do

259
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,610
something like carbon fiber and we're

260
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:44,010
like okay sure maybe so we bought some

261
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:47,070
carbon fiber and took us about 2 or 3

262
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:49,800
days to figure out how to do it we use

263
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,240
bar resin instead of like the real

264
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,550
resident cuz my wife is very sensitive

265
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,120
to smells and she would have killed me

266
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,790
if it smelled like polyester resin so

267
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,150
essentially we took a Lego brick for the

268
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,969
the light section we cast that in in

269
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:10,350
silicone we poured bar resin and that

270
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:12,900
made a nice clear piece and stuck it in

271
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,840
there and these were the readers that we

272
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,720
came up with the first two on the left

273
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,670
are not not that great but that was our

274
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,900
first attempt at doing it but you can

275
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:26,849
see this is eight Legos wide on the on

276
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,980
the eight dots

277
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,500
I guess eight dots of Legos wide on the

278
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,330
reader itself the one on the right is

279
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,190
our probably our third attempt and is

280
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,420
much better and again come see me after

281
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,090
the show and you can see how thin and

282
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,250
small it is none of these were adhered

283
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,960
to the wall in any way anyone could have

284
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,640
tugged them off there was actually a

285
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,370
note underneath them that said

286
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,260
congratulations you found an implant

287
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,840
please come get some extra credit at

288
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,330
work you know that kind of thing

289
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,550
no one hesitated so for about a week

290
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:59,340
their badge scanners changed constantly

291
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,479
and it's their external badge scanner on

292
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,400
the outside of their building

293
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,400
there's nothing internal yet

294
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:13,389
so now we had to make one that was

295
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:16,559
really crappy we used a plastic resin

296
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:19,800
and then we cracked it with a hammer and

297
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:25,029
then we glued it all back together and

298
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:28,660
stuck some wires out of it and that one

299
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:30,309
after 10 people had used it got pulled

300
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,999
off the wall and that person got a

301
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:36,699
little attaboy she thought it would be a

302
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:40,029
shock hazard stret current I don't want

303
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:42,639
to get into it but it wouldn't be but

304
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,589
yeah we had to basically make this thing

305
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,019
look like a can of smashed ass to get

306
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:49,149
somebody to notice that it's not right

307
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:53,499
and they were constantly changing so

308
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:55,300
that was fun we had another client who

309
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,490
got on board with the idea and they

310
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,929
liked what we were doing with our other

311
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,839
client they had actually heard about it

312
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:04,740
and not through us but through the

313
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,949
grapevine I suppose and we made these

314
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,170
ultra-thin ones these do not cover the

315
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:14,439
entire scanner these are just like a

316
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,610
fascia that goes over it and again

317
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:18,490
you'll probably have to see me because

318
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,790
the pictures don't do it justice they

319
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,959
also did not want it to look exactly

320
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,329
right so I don't know if you can notice

321
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,290
at the top there's kind of a dip in the

322
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:31,599
top and I actually used hot glue for the

323
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,219
the the window there so it's really dull

324
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,550
it's really hard to see this one's

325
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,870
really scratched up the hid again the

326
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,559
picture doesn't do it justice but the

327
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:44,529
hid that's the branding at the bottom is

328
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,749
not very clear it's it doesn't look

329
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:49,990
quite right even the color is off they

330
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:51,939
had blue scanners I want to say and we

331
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,620
put black over them and nobody seemed to

332
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:59,170
notice on those okay so what else could

333
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,699
we do so the second client really liked

334
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,929
the scanner but they thought maybe

335
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,549
there's something else they could do

336
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:05,110
because the other stuff had been done

337
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:07,379
and we knew it was probably going to

338
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,639
work with their their clientele as well

339
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:12,339
so we took the reader that we used to

340
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,470
have for our mold-making we took one of

341
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:16,660
the RFID tools they weren't okay with us

342
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,460
writing down the the badges so this time

343
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,920
we use the RFID tool to

344
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,780
- the Weigand protocol we double-sided

345
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:30,959
tape that to the wall next to the reader

346
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:36,010
and putting out of order sign on it and

347
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:38,070
that worked so people would badge on the

348
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,390
evil twin over there on the right and

349
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,510
then that wouldn't worry it would beep

350
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:45,010
but nothing happened at the door so they

351
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,290
would then badge on the out of order one

352
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,610
sometimes I got both and it did work so

353
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,730
sometimes I kind of went in the middle

354
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,410
of the to split the difference and they

355
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,230
didn't know which one it was so the it

356
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,600
worked we had one lady who we gave some

357
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:03,610
extra points to she moved the out of

358
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:07,060
order sign from the left to the right so

359
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:11,370
she was real nice so we're we're happy

360
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:14,770
to have her she's a good egg

361
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,060
all right so people didn't seem to know

362
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,630
what to do with these scanners nobody

363
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,760
batted an eye as long as they worked so

364
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,800
what could we do to actually break the

365
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,620
scanner without breaking the scanner so

366
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,439
we used our entire covers our

367
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:32,170
carbon-fiber ones at the second client

368
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,060
and we put a piece of metal mesh the

369
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:38,650
screen door mesh you get at the hardware

370
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:41,589
store it is dirt cheap and it blocks the

371
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:45,010
the scanner from working I then put on a

372
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:46,990
navy blue blazer and when the badge

373
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,000
wouldn't work I would come out and I had

374
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,350
a laptop with me and a scanner because

375
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,450
we didn't have their badge scanned yet

376
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,000
so I needed to get a bad scan so I had

377
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,380
my laptop and a scanner and we'd ask

378
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,230
them to scan their badge and I'll say no

379
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,630
it's still not working

380
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:04,810
what is your manager's name what is your

381
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,670
ID what is your what is the answer to

382
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:09,550
your secret password or your secret

383
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:15,209
question rather and they I don't know

384
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:15,209
what's my secret question is it a mascot

385
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:21,130
no yeah you know that and we just say

386
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:23,439
big things like that and they would say

387
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,070
oh the Wolverines okay yeah sure all

388
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,960
right go ahead go in we knew they were

389
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,360
actual employees before doing that we

390
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,260
also had a secondary

391
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,750
the company has secondary traps inside

392
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,570
so we knew we weren't just letting any

393
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,070
Joe Schmoe in but yeah we were able to

394
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,960
social engineer the people into giving

395
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,169
us information they wouldn't give there

396
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,220
is no security staff at this entrance

397
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,679
they've never seen a security guard

398
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,360
probably before but here I am coming out

399
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:58,000
of the building asking them these

400
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,500
questions so I got pretty I was pretty

401
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,860
excited at first and then I really

402
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,120
started to feel bad for for the client

403
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,428
yeah because everybody was just giving

404
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,750
me anything I asked for as long as I had

405
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:11,890
the navy blue blazer and it said

406
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:14,740
security on my lapel so they had to do

407
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,420
it but nobody questioned me nobody asked

408
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,220
me anything but I figure you could

409
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,410
probably take me out of the equation and

410
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,559
just put some sort of call box on the

411
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,360
the side of the door and maybe a cell

412
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,399
phone that's in speaker mode and just

413
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,080
stick it in the box there and you could

414
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,890
ask people through the little speaker

415
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,570
there those same questions and it looks

416
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,550
official it's on the building so what

417
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,620
supposed to be there right so it would

418
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:43,240
probably work I have not been able to do

419
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:44,620
this and you could break the the RFID

420
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,750
badge reader in the same way we were

421
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,820
doing with the Faraday cage or you could

422
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,860
use one of these RFID tool or I'm sorry

423
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,129
yeah the RFID tool or the Bleak key they

424
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,928
can actually Doss the Wiegand wire and

425
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,070
keep people from badging in so you

426
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:01,570
wouldn't actually have to make a cover

427
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:03,370
you could actually break the the readers

428
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,379
without actually having to break the

429
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,110
reader you can kind of daus the the

430
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,900
command-and-control

431
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:12,909
that way so other people have noticed

432
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,880
that there are plenty of room for

433
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:17,920
activities inside these readers so at

434
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,679
first we showed you the the tastic rit

435
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,260
thief that he put in his man-bag

436
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,240
gentleman on twitter silas noticed that

437
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,190
you could stick what this device here

438
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,920
which is a proxmark three

439
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:32,410
revision four reader you could stick

440
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,730
that inside of a reader and no one's

441
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,890
gonna know so you don't have to make a

442
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,740
fancy cover like we made the ones we

443
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:41,800
made are filled with epoxy and gel so

444
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,120
you do have to make them but and this

445
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,960
reader which is very common and I've

446
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,370
seen on plenty of buildings you can

447
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:53,029
just pop it in there there's actually no

448
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:54,949
tamper or theft evidence with the with

449
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:58,130
this particular reader other readers do

450
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:01,039
have a little light on the back and they

451
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,570
let you know when someone has taken it

452
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,730
off the wall or tried to mess with the

453
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,939
wires you know that kind of thing

454
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:14,059
this readers not one of those however I

455
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:16,159
will caveat the tamper light and and the

456
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:17,600
alarm that it can send a lot of people

457
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,500
don't have that hooked up a lot of

458
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,969
people don't monitor that and even if it

459
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,100
is hooked up yet again they probably

460
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:29,090
don't even monitor it so you might want

461
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:31,189
to test if you get permission at work if

462
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:33,559
you can take your badge reader off the

463
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,419
wall and put it back on and see if

464
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,450
anybody notices because that will trip

465
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:40,760
that should-should trip an alarm for

466
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,110
someone so what could you do with I

467
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,590
wanted to come up with worst-case

468
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:47,510
scenarios for badges if I had this thing

469
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,240
on for a week could I

470
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,890
Ransome your badges could I sell your

471
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,649
information to a competitor could I

472
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:57,320
threaten your company by releasing them

473
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:59,209
to the public if they didn't pay me some

474
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,730
money now you're gonna have to re re ID

475
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,830
all your people but could I in the

476
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,980
meantime get a little extra money while

477
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:09,049
doing it probably not I think they'd

478
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:13,419
probably just step up security if that

479
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:15,408
happened but I I kind of like to think

480
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:18,110
viciously and and that's the most

481
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:20,510
vicious thing I could think of with RFID

482
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,120
badges I do want to talk about some

483
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,890
solutions because badges some patches

484
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,239
are very hard to clone and some badges

485
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:32,919
are as of yet not able to be cloned so

486
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:37,460
the CIO's corporate 1000 badge from hid

487
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:39,740
these are very good badges they are

488
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,330
exclusively from hid I don't believe you

489
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,669
can buy them anywhere else somebody may

490
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,370
have to correct me if I'm wrong we have

491
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:50,480
clients with these so they were not

492
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:53,209
interested in our RFID ideas our our

493
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,980
badge reader ideas but they were more

494
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,710
interested in the cloner or I'm sorry

495
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,669
the the implants that go behind the the

496
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,100
reader

497
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:04,429
because that protocol from the reader to

498
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,439
the controller is essentially plain text

499
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,649
and anyone can read it so they were more

500
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,359
interested in that so now you have a

501
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:13,969
secure card but you have an insecure

502
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,908
reader so I just want to point out that

503
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,610
there are secure cards but sometimes the

504
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:19,690
reader is the weakest link

505
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,399
[Music]

506
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,570
again I this is just talking about the

507
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:28,699
CEOs corporate card and the fact that

508
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:31,070
hid is the only person who is an

509
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,590
authorized seller of them you have to

510
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,769
apply for these cards they don't just

511
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:40,039
let any Joe Schmo off the reservation

512
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:44,749
buy them they actually bet you for these

513
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:46,609
cards and then yeah so researchers I

514
00:22:44,749 --> 00:22:49,159
think have had a hard time getting their

515
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:50,418
hands on you know spare equipment and

516
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,489
things like that but I'm sure it's

517
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:56,269
available somewhere on eBay if somebody

518
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:58,489
who looked hard enough it's also a

519
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:02,950
proprietary format and this has not

520
00:22:58,489 --> 00:23:05,779
served HID well in the past so I would

521
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,639
implore them to get that publicly

522
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:11,389
inspected so that other people might

523
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:13,609
find the chinks in the armor the holes

524
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:15,738
that that may exist in it and so they

525
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:17,178
can get them patched

526
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:19,159
I want to talk about some of the

527
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:20,509
competitors that they have because

528
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,330
they're not the only game in the market

529
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:27,350
but they're the one I run into the most

530
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:29,749
and dala AGC asset al boy has bought

531
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:32,059
door makers lock lock makers badge

532
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:35,389
makers if you want to get in the

533
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:38,649
physical access control a game alsa a

534
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:41,209
boy will buy you your mileage may vary

535
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:44,959
Johnson Controls Honeywell Vanderbilt

536
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:46,940
open path and Kesey I'm running a little

537
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,950
short on time so I'm just going to talk

538
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,259
about open path I think with these

539
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,909
slides because it's something we've been

540
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:56,139
evaluating and they took into

541
00:23:52,909 --> 00:24:00,049
consideration most of the security and

542
00:23:56,139 --> 00:24:03,320
problems that have plagued RFID readers

543
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:06,019
in the past so the pros you know

544
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,689
encrypted from the reader to the

545
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:13,790
controller and from the from the

546
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,530
the badge to that the reader itself so

547
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:19,159
they have encryption all the way through

548
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:21,290
which is where you want to be they

549
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,450
integrate with everything you can

550
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,820
schedule the locking and all this great

551
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,890
stuff they're pretty cheap as well so

552
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,928
our client has been evaluating them for

553
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,960
about a month and I think they're going

554
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:34,520
to go with them over some of the others

555
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,920
but there are some good alternatives

556
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:41,929
Kesey is another one that is on par

557
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:44,150
photo IDs are something that so that

558
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:45,740
this technology works with your phone so

559
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,299
you had the phone in your pocket you

560
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,470
actually go up and touch the reader just

561
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:51,080
with your hand just to let it know

562
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:53,390
you're present and then the phone sends

563
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,710
the signal I'm sorry the reader sends a

564
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,740
signal to the phone the phone replies

565
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:00,380
you're either led in or you're not some

566
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:04,220
places like to have the old-school badge

567
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:06,470
on on a person or a picture ID and and

568
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,440
won't be satisfied just with a phone in

569
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,059
your pocket if you were issuing phones

570
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,070
to your employees that might get

571
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:15,830
expensive when they lose their their

572
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:20,260
badge so I think that that might be a

573
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:22,460
con most people have a phone I think so

574
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:25,100
you might have to buy phones for people

575
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,020
if that's gonna be your only badge I

576
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,730
don't trust the cloud it's actually

577
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,780
hosting I don't know if anybody's aware

578
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:34,940
but that's just hosting and lockdown can

579
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,500
be enabled by anyone's this is where you

580
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,480
suspect something is happening at the

581
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,299
building and you push a panic button on

582
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,820
your phone and it seems like anyone in

583
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:47,629
the the organization who has the the app

584
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:50,120
can can do that so maybe you get a panic

585
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,910
situation or someone sitting on the the

586
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,639
phone or your kid and doing it while

587
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,230
you're at home who knows your cat walks

588
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,940
across your phone you know you know how

589
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:03,470
it is some access control alternative so

590
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:08,809
it's not just RFID that's out there

591
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:10,990
there's actually QR codes or laser laser

592
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:13,580
you know reading the QR codes with your

593
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:17,059
with an app so you show your phone to

594
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:20,750
the the UPC you know the scanner and it

595
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:22,250
reads your phone and you off you go you

596
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,290
can print out these visitor badges I've

597
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,880
been to a few places that have them

598
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,940
this was the name I was going by when I

599
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:32,120
when I visited there and that's what I

600
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:35,630
put up there and so it was effective I

601
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,080
wouldn't say it's great and again the

602
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:42,049
the I'm not sure how long these these

603
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,399
live or if they're one-time use kind of

604
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:49,250
kind of things I haven't investigated

605
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,690
them exactly fully deviant olam I want

606
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,770
to give him a shout out he talks about

607
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:58,010
door fitment and the way things should

608
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:59,510
fit properly on the doors there's a lot

609
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:02,090
of lock-picking I'm sure we've all seen

610
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:05,540
it they can go over the door they can go

611
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:07,129
under the door RFID is gonna be the last

612
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,970
thing on your mind if you watch this

613
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:13,160
man's talk he he gets into buildings

614
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:16,730
like nobody's business did anybody see

615
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,679
when Dave Kennedy blew the vape smoke

616
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,000
through the doors and then there's a

617
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,059
little sensor at the top and a little

618
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,250
exit sensor that goes off and he pushes

619
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:27,440
the doors open into a big cloud of smoke

620
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,640
you know what thinking back on it I

621
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,660
should have put it right up here so

622
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,480
tonight yeah so it's it's

623
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:39,260
well-documented again francis brown's

624
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,780
tastic our ID thief rfid gimme are two

625
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,540
good talks by him I cannot say some of

626
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:48,260
these other names

627
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:52,210
jaesik so this guy understands rfid on a

628
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:55,010
level that I could never hope to and he

629
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:57,200
he talks about all the pain points all

630
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,120
the problems that they've had with RFID

631
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,370
in the past and he really addresses them

632
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,229
well he even brought up something I

633
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:06,469
never knew about was there's a crime

634
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:08,570
scene card for hotels so if you go up to

635
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,730
a hotel something happens to the hotel

636
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:13,939
the police have a crime scene card that

637
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:16,490
will disable the reader for I don't know

638
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,890
how long but nobody can get in and are

639
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:20,450
out even the hotel staff you know unless

640
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,940
you have this crime scene card so it

641
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,520
basically locks down it seems like a bad

642
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,500
idea if somebody were ever to figure out

643
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:30,889
that crime scene card it may just be the

644
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,659
same key over and over I'm not 100% sure

645
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:35,270
but you could probably just run down the

646
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:36,510
hallway and crime scene card the whole

647
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,360
thing

648
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:42,480
and then the police I have to show up to

649
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,299
undo it right so maybe you can threaten

650
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,299
the hotel with I'll crime scene card

651
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:51,030
your your hallways if you don't give me

652
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:53,418
some money or the honeymoon suite

653
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,418
whatever

654
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,510
so for mold-making and the things that

655
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,100
we we took on and the things we didn't

656
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:03,390
know how to do YouTube was a great

657
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,860
inspiration or you know helped us

658
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,480
understand what we're gonna do and

659
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,219
that's why some of those turned out so

660
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,640
crappy and when you come outside and and

661
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,010
and see you'll you'll see how crappy

662
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,510
they are in real life actually but they

663
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:18,480
fooled people left and right it was

664
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,940
amazing we did we expected to get caught

665
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,559
and we weren't chris hag natty does a

666
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,809
lot of social engineering and it kind of

667
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:30,270
inspired my security guard idea and my

668
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:34,500
my call box idea that we haven't done

669
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:38,160
yet but I wish I wish we could have so

670
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,600
basically that that's the talk come see

671
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,669
me for your touch and feel session and

672
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,139
then you can also see the devices I've

673
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:50,179
made so I'm ready for questions and

674
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,179
answers if anybody wants one yeah sure

675
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,520
have I dealt with personal

676
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,650
identification I did I'm sorry

677
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,160
personal identity identification I don't

678
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,160
think I have

679
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,479
cat carts no I have not been up on that

680
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:15,159
this is more I guess the generic like

681
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:35,020
private sector kind of stuff yeah anyone

682
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:36,159
else sure sure yeah so obviously you

683
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,690
could use them the you know so the

684
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,400
question was could you use the badges

685
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,470
just for a pen test and absolutely you

686
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:47,950
could definitely do that and that's kind

687
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:50,260
of the point of why we started it right

688
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,880
if you catch the right person maybe put

689
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,039
them on after hours and maybe the

690
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,419
cleaning staff shows up late at night

691
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:57,010
and maybe you get the cleaning staff

692
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:58,960
you're more prone to get the cleaning

693
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,340
staff at that point maybe and the

694
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,970
cleaning staff usually has access to

695
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,970
about everything

696
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:17,480
anybody else it's going once going twice

697
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:19,759
yes have I tried the brute-forcing of

698
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,499
identities yes so we have clone cards we

699
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:25,190
have done the brute-forcing we've used

700
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:26,570
the Wi-Fi to land the bleakie there they

701
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,220
make everything so much simpler and

702
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,529
again very smart people put those

703
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:35,710
together I just AM standing on the

704
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:35,710
shoulders of those giants yep

705
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:53,930
right so maybe replay the card over and

706
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:57,710
over now I this software does not so the

707
00:31:53,930 --> 00:32:00,530
software can trigger when there's a the

708
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,930
same badge one after the other but I

709
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:05,300
think that I don't know where that lies

710
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:08,090
but I know there are organizations where

711
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,950
if you give you know you badge you hand

712
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,530
it to your buddy behind you and they

713
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,420
badge then it's locked out so for two

714
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,550
minutes for that badge other badges can

715
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,680
can read through I'm not sure where the

716
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:26,180
logic lies in that but yeah that that's

717
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:27,990
a good question all right well thank you

718
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:34,339
guys

719
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:34,339
[Applause]
