1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:14,399
I don't know why everybody's clapping we

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,240
still got five minutes before we start

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,220
but just just kidding thank you all for

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
coming out here for the final Derby con

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,509
and man what a amazing conference this

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,680
year by far our best and that is a

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,970
testament to all of you here so I'm

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,410
gonna give everybody here a round of

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,410
applause that made there become possible

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,200
I was talking to a bill who is our

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,640
liaison between the Marriott and it's

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
it's an interesting story because when

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,560
we first got here is very similar to the

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,180
Hyatt

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,460
everybody loves the Hyatt right we first

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,120
got to the Hyatt we first got to the

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,370
Hyatt

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,559
our first year they didn't realize what

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,300
derbycon was and it was a shock for them

20
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,830
and to really understand the caliber but

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,110
year after year we grew in relationships

22
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,570
and last year we put the mayor to a

23
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,129
wringer trust me it was it was it was an

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,810
interesting time and a relationship with

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,759
them and this year Lo and they came in

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,410
knowing exactly what's going on and you

27
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,060
can always judge how stressed bill is

28
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,700
based on how awful his hair starts to

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,430
get so by the end of last year his hair

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,479
was like his suit was untucked he has

31
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,369
his hair was everywhere

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,410
and this year he looked completely

33
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,869
relaxed which is awesome and one story I

34
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,149
wanted to share from last year is the

35
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,369
the Heiser incidents and Martin you'd be

36
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:31,590
bested they explain that but basically

37
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,390
we snuck in some hazers that we weren't

38
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,710
supposed to have to do a Fox show

39
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,580
because it was part of the requirements

40
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,559
for The Offspring

41
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,880
and as soon as the hazers come on

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,869
everything you can see the all the folks

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,130
the merits are running around like why

44
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,420
is there hazers here why's her hazers

45
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,619
here and we're just like that keep

46
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,880
cranking it up you know keep the fog

47
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,909
down the crazy

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,020
why not and so we definitely abided by a

49
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,610
lot of the rules this year and I think

50
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,580
it was a good relationship and it was a

51
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:57,869
ton of fun so again this year by far our

52
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,330
best year ever

53
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,670
and what an amazing time to close on our

54
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,500
best and highest note possible our

55
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,790
incidents were so friggin low we had a

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,140
couple minor incidents I mean we had to

57
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,060
take like 20 people that were drunk up

58
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,889
to their rooms happens all the time I

59
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,090
was not one of those by the way so that

60
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,320

62
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,760
last night was close I'm not gonna lie

63
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,700
last night David Vaughn got me home last

64
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,078

65

everybody that made Derby calm possible

89
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,790
and we spend months and months and

90
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,830
months and months planning this out it

91
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,319
takes us eight months to build this this

92
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,819
what you see here today and everybody on

93
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,589
this here on the stage puts in that

94
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,319
effort to really create what you see

95
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:17,579
here everything from Paul with security

96
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:20,120
how was security this year I said new as

97
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,660
I was gonna happen I wouldn't explain

98
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,190
what happened just a few minutes ago

99
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,110
because it honestly really messed me up

100
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,460
that was not that bad okay but what

101
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,200
really messed me up is I was walking in

102
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,719
the back here the service area here

103
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,360
where no one's supposed to be and I an

104
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,419
in the corner I see bright cloud out of

105
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,310
my eyes see like bright clown pictures

106
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,539
and I'm like there's no way

107
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,180
there's a clown in here start the

108
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,100
language sir there's no way there's a

109
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,270
clown in here and I'm like and I started

110
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,070
a double-take I'm like what if that's a

111
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,200
clown and then I'm like do I look right

112
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,270
do not look and I looked at writing as a

113
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,010
clown seeing there and like why is there

114
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,130
a clown sitting in the service area it

115
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:02,070
makes no sense so that was pretty bad so

116
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,960
thank you thank you all who did that no

117
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,390
but Paul from a security perspective the

118
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,190
operations here was incredible we're

119
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,810
very formal organized after doing this

120
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,600
for nine years we have a slack shadow

121
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,190

122
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,050
know everything that's going on the

123
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,610
details of those and a really well

124
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,110
organized team here and so a special

125
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,639
shout out to our security team that they

126
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,960
made this possible because you guys were

127
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,960
incredible guys and gals were incredible

128
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:43,030
we say boo 400 a security team yeah but

129
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,350
also a law enforcement was amazing as

130
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,729
well they were out there playing video

131
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,020
games with us and everything I thought

132
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,370
that was really cool we got a picture of

133
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,810
one of the officers playing the the

134
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,730
video games on the TV that was really

135
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,200
cool but they seemed really chill the

136
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,670
passing out stickers I mean they were

137
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,920
really incredible to keeping everybody

138
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,560
safe even though we didn't need to

year and he put a ton of work into this

331
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,889
thing you should have seen the build

332
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,600
quality it was amazing

333
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:32,879
we let him matter anyway we just docked

334
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,550
him a couple points on style because it

335
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,740
was the wrong style of Derby and he's

336
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:41,729
still tied with integral probably cuz

337
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:44,009
integrals was also not finished but the

338
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,110
thing ran Kali Linux it had a Wi-Fi

339
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,939
adapter it had like a disco ball on top

340
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,759
and it was all steampunk teamed it was

341
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:54,420
just amazing he had I want a duster that

342
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:56,279

technological in any sense it was a

350

doing the final polygraph challenge so

466
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:40,820

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,460
community we experience a much higher

658
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,130
elevation of folks with depression and

659
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,480
other mental issues and you know there

660
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,190
are people out there to talk to you and

661
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,240
there are people to help you out and I

662
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:42,220
think that's really important to

663
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,080
understand that what Amanda's doing is

664
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,910
saving people's lives and what a man is

665
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,900
doing is being able to share your

666
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,049
experiences and know that you're not

667
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:52,300
alone in certain cases and that's really

668
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,280
incredible and we are so proud to have

669
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,440
had the very first mental health village

670
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,480
with Amanda here at derbycon last year

671
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,160
and it was a huge success and it was

672
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,030
again this year so thanks again Amanda

673
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,240
and everybody else that makes that

674
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,240
possible

675
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:30,799

680
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,089

681
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,370
to write this down because I wanted to

682
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,840

683

686
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:55,670
hacker community you've deepened our

687
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,189

outside the walls of this conference and

691
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:05,569
all over the world you showed the world

692
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,879
the true heart of the hacker community

693
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:10,040
because of you the spirit of derbycon

694
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,900

695

much

697
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:31,050
I want to give a special shout-out to

698
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,640
the rural tech fund I don't think

699
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:35,430
there's anybody here from the real tech

700
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:40,620
fund Chris you hear Chris come up here

701
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:42,120
get up here I have I've had the pleasure

702
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,430
of starting to get to know Chris on a

703
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,650
much deeper level over the past few

704
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:48,930
months and I can tell you that Chris is

705
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,220
is an absolute gem and an amazing person

706
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,560
or what he does and when he's trying to

707
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,600
accomplish with rural tech fund and you

708
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,220
know I'll show you some stats on the

709
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,839
impact that we've had from a derbycon

710
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,430
perspective but it's people like Johnny

711
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,740
it's people like Amanda as people like

712
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:05,520
Chris is people like kripp not you Chris

713
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:07,319
Chris and Chris Chris and Negi that make

714
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,270
huge differences in people's lives and

715
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,870
we're just great to be a facilitator of

716
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:14,490
that so Chris thanks Dave appreciate

717
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,960
that the checks in the mail for all the

718
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:17,459
nice things you said about me I've

719
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,240
talked to a lot of you today I've shaken

720
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,140
a lot of hands over this week and I

721
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,609
really thank everyone who came by the

722
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,850
booth one thing that I've learned in my

723
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:29,460
travels is that talent is distributed

724
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,470
equally but opportunity is not and a lot

725
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,630
of places that occurs are in the rural

726
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:35,759
areas that exist all around it doesn't

727
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,960
matter how urban you are whether we're

728
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,390
in the middle of Louisville in middle of

729
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,490
DC LA in New York Drive 30 45 minutes

730
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,290
you're gonna be in a rural area where

731
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:45,299
again the opportunity is not distributed

732
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,340
nearly as equally as it should be so I

733
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,750
gave a lot of you a number when you came

734
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:51,300
to me and I told you about the work we

735
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,980
were doing I told you that we had put

736
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,810
technology into the hands so far of

737
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,690
about 94 thousand kids across the

738
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:59,870
country

739
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:04,650
[Applause]

740
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:06,690
thank you better news we raised a lot of

741
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,700
money to do more of that this week and

742
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:11,670
we raised enough and with the projects

743
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,100
we've lined up we should clear a hundred

744
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:20,010
thousand within the next month or so so

745

next in the list I don't know what this

766
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,980
next one is about so I was told I need

767
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,840
to call Jim up to do something so

768
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,740
whatever that is and hopefully it's not

769
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:56,000
bad but we'll figure it out

770
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:57,049
thanks Jim no icing so Dave you and your

771
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,550
group didn't realize what you were

772
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:01,400
getting into when you started derbycon

773
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:03,320
in 2011 you didn't understand the impact

774
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,880
that an idea thrown around between a few

775
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,190
good friends would have on the lives of

776
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,320
people councils people over the years

777
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,820
their desire to make a difference has

778
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,950
changed the hacking community for the

779
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,720
better by setting a standard leading by

780
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,730
example and creating an environment and

781
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,230
community everyone that welcomes

782
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:21,980
everyone and provides opportunity for

783
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:25,970
all I met Dave in 2016 at NOLA con shout

784
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:27,440
out to NOLA con and immediately noticed

785
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,029
how much he cared about people and

786
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,130
others and in spite of his demanding

787
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:34,550
schedule he took time to meet with

788
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:35,930
everybody and encourage everyone a group

789
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:38,030
of us banded together and raised some

790
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,680
money as part to present a small token

791
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,690
of our appreciation to Dave and his team

792
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,730
but the rest is gonna go to charity so

793
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,170
we have a GoFundMe site listed on my

794
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,000
Twitter feed that will be open til the

795
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,290
end of the month so any money donated to

796
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,089
that will go to the charity after every

797
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:52,599
cons choice and we do have a little gift

798
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:52,599
for your team

799
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:02,450
so this was a hard one because dave has

800
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:04,220
quite a bourbon collection and if you

801
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,779
watch his Twitter feed he likes to tweet

802
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,279
about the different Bourbons he has and

803
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,470
I kept finding one that I liked and I

804
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,890
was gonna get for him and then I said

805
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,240
it's on his Twitter feed so Thursday I

806
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,490
went and I found a bourbon if you have

807
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:21,520
this bourbon I don't know what I'll do

808
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:25,160
but anyway at a bottle for Adrienne no

809
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,530
this is from a distillery that is way

810
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,140
out in the middle of nowhere it's called

811
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:32,420
whiskey thief and you have four bottles

812
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:35,960
of it to share with your team as you so

813
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:39,099
desire and you can pack all your friends

814
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,099

815
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:53,269

00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:06,919
the last week are a lot of folks came up

821
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,749
and we're like you know I'm gonna just

822
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:09,650
do something for Dave what can I do so

823
00:43:08,749 --> 00:43:12,979
we all started kind of put our heads

824
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:15,679
together and I told myself wouldn't get

825
00:43:12,979 --> 00:43:17,538
choked up forgive me for a lot of folks

826

derbycon is their favorite conference

827
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:21,859
and for a lot of folks this is family

828
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:23,119
for myself and I could speak for a lot

829
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:24,709
of folks this is the first time where we

830
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,910
actually felt like we're part of

831
00:43:24,709 --> 00:43:26,390
something bigger like we were part of a

832
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:30,529
family

833
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:32,779

okay so my first Derby con was three I

951
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:14,330
think

952
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:16,130
and I unofficially met Aaron because my

953
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:20,779
husband and Martin got in a fight on

954
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:22,400
Twitter oh that was okay I didn't

955
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:25,520
actually meet her officially till three

956
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:37,100
then so this is for you you have to come

957
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:42,290
here she also hates this so so with the

958
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:45,220
help of a couple of the people I know

959
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:49,630
you've been wanting notes or a while and

960
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,629
it'll match the couch in the basement

961
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:55,700
and I would also like to say I'm really

962
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,509
glad I didn't wait for the t-shirt for

963
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:12,919
this year because we ran out

964
00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:12,920

965
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:26,220

sounds like a you're welcome it's all

967
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:58,870
fine it's all fine that's actually funny

968
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:01,060
interesting enough how relationships

969
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:03,310
develop but Joey and I got on a Twitter

970
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:06,460
battle I think was in Derby con 2 right

971
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:08,170
and and you know I think we had gone

972
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,790
back and forth on Twitter like probably

973
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,140
five or six times and I think Joey

974
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,779
you're upset like one of those talks got

975
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:15,040
switched thing is what it was right and

976
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,060
you know I'm like man I run a conference

977
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,259
it's hard to do all this in the first

978
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,860
place we just switch conference we kind

979
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:26,680
of went back and forth but listen why

980
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:28,440
don't you meet me in person and we'll

981
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,140
hug it out

982
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:35,130
and we hugged it out and we hugged it

983
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:39,220
out and became really good friends and

984
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:40,570
it's amazing how that type of thing can

1255

01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:50,490
the Marion Gary

1257
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:52,140
[Applause]

1258
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:53,310

1260
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:56,400

1262
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,610
were here

1263
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:08,730
all right so black badges are always an

1264
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,990
interesting piece and I'm gonna speak a

1265
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,980
little about the black badges because I

1266
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:13,348
think it's important to understand is

1267
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,550
that black badges for us are a symbol of

1268
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:15,990
gratitude a symbol that you've gone

1269
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:18,480
above and beyond the community of what

1270
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:20,310
we expect of you or not expect but just

1271
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,950
you doing what you do because you're an

1272
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:24,270
amazing person and while we cannot award

1273
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:26,009
everybody black badges even though all

1274
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:28,080
the things say black badges on your on

1275
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:29,220
your things they are black badge is that

1276
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:32,330
the reason why we put those on the

1277
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:34,379
attendees badges was really because we

1278
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:35,848
appreciate everybody and everything that

1279
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:38,220
you've done and that you're all part of

1280
01:06:35,849 --> 01:06:41,339
the community but we wanted to come up

1281
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:43,890

1282
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:45,060

that there are while derbycon is ending

1382
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:35,330
there's many conferences out there that

1383
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:40,930
have had a huge influence from derbycon

1384
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:43,460
and sorry that have started their own

1385
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:44,690
ways of accepting our black badges and

1386
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:47,570

1410
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:51,820
folks that are going to be accepting all

1411
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:56,440
these different things they're derby

1412

sides derby sides that sounds awesome

1413
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:01,719
yeah they're besides as well one thing I

1414
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,890
wanted to throw a caveat there with

1415
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,120
which has been a point of confusion it's

1416
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:06,640
funny because this is actually a funny

1417
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:08,080
story um so the first one to do this was

1418
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,400
Dirk on I was talking to Jamie and

1419
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,260
Jamie's like hey we want to be the first

1420
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,610
to accept all of your black badges and

1421
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:14,160
this really spawned the whole idea so

1422
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:17,469
Jamie gets gets all the credit for this

1423
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:19,389
and she's like hey we'd like to sponsor

1424
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:21,100
reward all your black badges to come to

1425
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:22,540
work on for free oh maybe that's great

1426
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:24,370
and and I was like I didn't think about

1427
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,360
that all of the attendee badges and

1428
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:28,920
security badges and everything had

1429
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,920
plaque but has present on them like oh

1430
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:34,720
so I want to emphasize that it is

1431
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:36,730
awarded black badges that are accepted

1432
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,320
it's not every attendee badger staff

1433
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:40,419
badge or screw bitch it says black badge

1434
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,620
on there I'm sorry I can't get 3,000

1435
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:44,710
people in the conferences that don't

1436
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:46,300
hold 3,000 people that'd be awesome by

1437
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:48,190
the way I would try it I've like hey

1438
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:51,340
Jamie can you accept 3,000 people by any

1439
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:53,230
chance but I just want to say that this

1440
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,890
is a testament to to what we were doing

1441
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:56,019
here at derbycon

1442
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:59,650

1443
01:13:56,020 --> 01:14:01,510

01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:04,390
exploitation thing of her dad for

1468
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,830
derbycon I'm like man he's like I'm

1469
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:07,540
thinking about publishing it and putting

1470
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:08,680
it on my slide so I'm like can I look at

1471
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:11,769
it first because I wasn't sure if I was

1472
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:13,960
enable or not and I was not it was very

1473
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:17,410
very nice I was very nice I'm like hey I

1474
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:19,420
was shockingly nice so I was like hey

1475
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:20,860
man if you want me to redact some stuff

1476
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:22,150
or don't publish anything please let me

1477
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,920
know we're really excited to do this

1478
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:25,450
talk and you know we want to coordinate

1479
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,760
this with you folks and everything else

1480
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:29,290
and and Microsoft was was amazing on the

1481
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,400
backhand side so lead thank you for all

1482
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:31,900
that you've done for the community what

1483
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,849
you continue to do for over there

1484
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:35,950
Microsoft and and for protecting people

1485
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:37,810
and really being one of the one of the

1486
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:41,040
foundational pieces of PowerShell so

1487
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:41,040
thank you very much Lee appreciate it

1488
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:53,430
so Tim can you come up really quick Tim

1489
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:55,080
arias so we have a new announcement here

1490
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:57,270
and Tim's really been spearheading a lot

1491
01:15:55,080 --> 01:16:00,059
of this and a lot of these conferences

1492
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:01,770
now are while they're accepting their

1493
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:04,140
black badges you've also figured out a

1494
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:06,600
way to network all of these conferences

1495
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:08,040
together to create a much more larger

1496
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,920
way for us to be able to share this

1497
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:15,930
community so thanks Dave

1498
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:17,490
can we go back one slide possible is

1499
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:18,870
that doesn't work that way I just

1500
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:20,940
thought it was kind of unfortunate that

1501
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:23,130
we've been talking throughout the past

1502
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:24,629
few days and Colonel Khan which is the

1503
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:26,790
Conda we're running wasn't actually

1504
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:28,050
listed on the slide up here so we didn't

1505
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:30,510
we didn't get like the little bit of a

1506
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:37,640
bonus that we wanted so in addition to

1507
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:39,840
not getting the hug from Dave you know I

1508
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,340
didn't get the hug from Dave we didn't

1509
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:48,960
get on the slide either so I was like

1510
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:50,430
insult and injury no hugs but we saw we

1511
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,950
saw this happening or I saw this

1512
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:55,500
happening on Twitter you know days or

1513
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:56,880
weeks ago and the notion was sort of

1514
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,200
like this is great this is the way Derby

1515
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,450
Khan's ending it's a way to sort of

1516
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:02,010
extend that the culture and the

1517
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:04,080
community but but it seemed like there

1518
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:07,710
was just something that was a little off

1519
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:09,570
or a little sort of incomplete about it

1520
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:11,090
for some reason and I couldn't quite put

1521
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:14,370
my finger on it until just days before

1522
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:16,830
the conference here that it's nice that

1523
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:19,019
all the conference's are honoring Derby

1524
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:20,790
Khan's badges that's sort of like a one

1525
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:22,470
directional kind of thing like Derby

1526
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:24,000
Khan's ending and only with the end of

1527
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:27,720
the conference to certain people to get

1528
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,850
out and the idea started to form that we

1529
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:32,460
should really be extending the hacking

1530
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:34,020
culture the idea of curiosity and puzzle

1531
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:37,590
solving and understanding how things

1532
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:39,810
work and also the community and the

1533
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:41,160
family is the word that you guys all use

1534
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:45,000
and a lot of people have used in the

1535
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:47,190
past hour or so and really extending it

1536
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,600
out so I started trying to get a hold of

1537
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:50,790
everybody that I didn't already know on

1538
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,920
these conferences and the idea is let's

1539
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:55,950
let's merge these two traits together

1540
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:58,170
and let's do black badge reciprocity so

1541
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:59,159
instead of just honoring Derby Khan's

1542
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:01,320
badges

1543
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:02,759
conferences are are honoring each

1544
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,880
other's badges like while the

1545
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,620
conference's are still going on so

1546
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,980
Colonel Khan gherkin thought Khan's

1547
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:13,650
cipher con Wild West hack infest Texas

1548
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:15,750
cyber summit will not only honor Derby

1549
01:18:13,650 --> 01:18:19,280
Khan's black badges but they will honor

1550
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:19,280
each other's black badges

1551
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:30,949
so details to be sorted out in every

1552
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:33,019
conference does registration a little

1553
01:18:30,949 --> 01:18:36,710
differently more anonymous than others

1554
01:18:33,019 --> 01:18:38,119
and pre-registration and all those

1555
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:40,070
things so we're sorting those out but

1556
01:18:38,119 --> 01:18:41,719
those people have pledged to figure it

1557
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:44,599
out and we've worked it out enough that

1558
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:49,940
we think it's possible and special

1559
01:18:44,599 --> 01:18:54,289
thanks to egg drop X c75 God's man

1560

here but through you know kicking this

1564
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,909
thing off and getting this started

1565
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,199
because this is the way that the

1566
01:19:04,909 --> 01:19:06,999
community is going to continue to thrive

1567
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:17,598
and grow

1568
01:19:06,999 --> 01:19:19,010
thank you so much the one thing they

1569
01:19:17,599 --> 01:19:20,329
don't and I apologize for having

1570
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:22,249
criminal comp there a lot of stuff

1571
01:19:20,329 --> 01:19:23,840
happened the same time but I went to

1572
01:19:22,249 --> 01:19:25,460
Colonel Khan this year and it was a

1573
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,800
phenomenal conference first year running

1574
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,269
right and it was absolutely incredible

1575
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,249
to be a part of that and that's another

1576
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:33,099
community family field that's growing so

1577
01:19:31,249 --> 01:19:35,059
check out Colonel Khan if you can and

1578
01:19:33,099 --> 01:19:37,670
everything that's going on here with the

1579
01:19:35,059 --> 01:19:38,989
reciprocity and the ability to talk and

1580
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:40,219
communicate with with different

1581
01:19:38,989 --> 01:19:42,230
conferences that have the same mindset

1582
01:19:40,219 --> 01:19:43,639
this community is growing and it's a

1583
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:45,678
fire and it's not gonna stop growing

1584
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:47,119
anytime soon and that's an amazing thing

1585
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,390
so thank you Tim for setting all that

1586
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:54,159
really appreciate it

1587
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:56,370

01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,820

1596
01:20:14,139 --> 01:20:18,280
throughout derbycon just raising money

1598
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:22,780
the world it's a lot of fun my stomach

1599
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,719
still hurts from this last one it was

1600
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:28,120
just so much fun but we did announce

1601
01:20:25,719 --> 01:20:30,520
that this was this table auction that we

1602
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:32,830
just did was our last live auction I

1603
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:35,350
really felt like this was something that

1604
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:38,139
was so incredibly special that started

1605
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:40,420
here really and the spirit of community

1606
01:20:38,139 --> 01:20:42,460
was just so strong here it was unlike

1607
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,630
anything we had ever seen that I made an

1608
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:45,760
announcement that that was the last

1609
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:48,250
auction so you're getting ready to

1610
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,350
announce an auction for HFC it's

1611
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:52,449
officially canceled we're gonna do

1612
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:53,620
something different when when I first

1613
01:20:52,449 --> 01:20:55,178
started hackers for charity one of the

1614
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:58,120
things that I wanted to do was I wanted

1615
01:20:55,179 --> 01:21:00,280
to show the world what hackers could do

1616
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:03,699
for good you know I wanted to show the

1617
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:06,070
world that what Derby con shows the

1618
01:21:03,699 --> 01:21:07,540
world is that hackers have hearts

1619
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,219
hackers are doing incredible things

1620
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:11,139
we're securing the world or making the

1621
01:21:09,219 --> 01:21:12,730
world a better place we're given two

1622
01:21:11,139 --> 01:21:15,219
charities we're doing a lot we're given

1623
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:16,509
a lot and that's that's happened we've

1624
01:21:15,219 --> 01:21:17,590
seen that happen when we first got

1625
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:20,110
started there weren't a lot of

1626
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:23,050

intentions or goals every year that we

1943
01:40:57,450 --> 01:41:02,489
did Derby con we'd go after Derby con

1944
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:03,989
and spend money on a nice meal that was

1945
01:41:02,489 --> 01:41:05,190
kind of our thank you for running Derby

1946
01:41:03,989 --> 01:41:06,959
con for the past eight months but then

1947
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:09,030
after that that money would either go to

1948
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,950
charity or go into the next year's event

1949
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:12,030
and make it even better and that's

1950
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:14,070
always been our goal has never been

1951
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:15,509
about making money in any way shape or

1952
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:17,160
form Derrick n was never about that it

1953
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:17,460
was about the community it always has

1954
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:20,130
been

1955
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:22,980
and one thing that I always like to note

1956
01:41:20,130 --> 01:41:24,480
is that when we decided to enter beak on

1957
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:26,129
one of the things that we wanted to do

1958
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,750
was take all the proceeds that we had

1959
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:29,670
after all of our expenses and donate

1960
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:30,960
those to our favorite charities and so

1961
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:33,120
we have a number of them listed up here

1962
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,070
and so I would just want to run through

1963
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:36,870
a couple of these the Crohn's and

1964
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:39,230
Colitis foundation offer Kyle that was

1965
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:39,230
Kyle's choice

1966
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:46,110
child's play the Center for Women and

1967
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:47,760
Gender Studies mental health hackers

1968
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:50,009
innocent last foundation hackers for

1969
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,780
charity rural tech fund and the American

1970
01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:53,070
Foundation for Suicide Prevention so all

1971
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:55,530
these proceeds that we make for derbycon

1972
01:41:53,070 --> 01:41:57,450
after we're done with everything will go

1973
01:41:55,530 --> 01:42:02,610
directly to these charities for what

1974
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:04,290
we're doing so I want to start off with

1975
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:05,849
what is derbycon and we only have a few

1976
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:06,989
minutes here left we have about 15

1977
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:08,510
minutes before we have to get off stage

1978
01:42:06,989 --> 01:42:11,040
and the light show starts to come off

1979
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:13,800
but I wanted to talk about what is

1980
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,760
derbycon and kind of our reasoning for

1981
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,630
starting it because I think it's

1982
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,620
important for the community to

1983
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:18,510
understand that derbycon

1984
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:19,769
wasn't just about starting a conference

1985
01:42:18,510 --> 01:42:22,170
and throwing big parties it was about

1986
01:42:19,770 --> 01:42:24,330
the community and the community is so

1987
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:26,610
important to us because the reason I

1988
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:28,739
honed in on derbycon and the reason why

1989
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:31,019
we started it I remember going to Alexis

1990
01:42:28,739 --> 01:42:33,480
Park at DEFCON 9 and I remember meeting

1991
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:35,730
people there like Chris Fyodor and Phil

1992
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:37,349
Zimmerman and coltd dead cows and you

1993
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:39,419
know the shmoo group and people that

1994
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:40,920
were just absolute heroes to me growing

1995
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:43,530
up in this industry that really set

1996
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:45,360
forth our next generation of people and

1997
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:46,679
I looked at that community as one that

1998
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,910
was willing to share in to collaborate

1999
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:50,520
and to share their experiences and

2000
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:51,960
really found what we are today I'm in

2001
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:54,030
this Kim Yuna's hacker community that we

2002
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:55,980
are today and what I wanted to create

2003
01:42:54,030 --> 01:42:57,269
with derbycon was a group where we could

2004
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:58,860
all come together regardless you're

2005
01:42:57,270 --> 01:43:00,900
brand new to InfoSec whether you just

2006
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:02,339
haven't even just going to college you

2007
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:04,679
know and you want to know where to go

2008
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:06,480
derby commas for you whether you're

2009
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:08,250
seasoned and you're you know have a

2010
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,929
reputation in the industry that there

2011
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:11,760
was no barriers to talk to them and that

2012
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:13,260
people could come together to to be one

2013
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,400
another and to learn from one another

2014
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:17,640
and to learn from our experiences

2015
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:18,870
whether you're a man or a woman or you

2016
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:20,969
know whether you had a race or religion

2017
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:22,469
it didn't matter when you came to Derby

2018
01:43:20,969 --> 01:43:25,140
Condit was for everybody and the

2019
01:43:22,469 --> 01:43:27,210
community is for everybody and that is

2020
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:30,930

not gonna make it through but one thing

2055
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:49,030
I do want to emphasize is that you know

2056
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:50,740
one thing that has always been a part of

2057
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:52,780
their begun is positivity and caring and

2058
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:55,179
compassion and that's everything for

2059
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:57,009
this community so appreciate it one

2060
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:59,170
thing I wanted to introduce before I get

2061
01:46:57,010 --> 01:47:01,120
to the final closing video is that while

2062
01:46:59,170 --> 01:47:03,220
we're going out we wanted to do

2063
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:06,340
something for the community and we're

2064
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:08,980
introducing derbycon communities and so

2065
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:11,140
we're gonna start on 501 c3 and it's a

2066
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:13,089
way of being able to create your own

2067
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:15,580
local chapters of derbycon in your own

2068
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:19,060
environments people that can come out to

2069
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:21,970
your locations new to InfoSec teach and

2070
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:23,410
help raise funding for charities and so

2071
01:47:21,970 --> 01:47:25,090
our whole goal with these is to create

2072
01:47:23,410 --> 01:47:26,849
micro Derby Khan's all across the

2073
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:35,649
country that you can run by yourselves

2074
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:35,649
[Applause]

2075
01:47:37,130 --> 01:47:40,679
so our test to you is that you start

2076
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:43,079
your own derbycon

2077
01:47:40,679 --> 01:47:44,790
and and created in a location take what

2078
01:47:43,079 --> 01:47:47,519
you've learned here and build it across

2079
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:48,840
the country across the world we had

2080
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:51,239
somebody come from Africa we had

2081
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:53,159
somebody come from London stardom in

2082
01:47:51,239 --> 01:47:55,409
those locations spread what derbycon is

2083
01:47:53,159 --> 01:47:57,179
and was to those communities and we have

2084
01:47:55,409 --> 01:47:59,549
more information the soon mover listing

2085
01:47:57,179 --> 01:48:00,960
a blog on it but Josh had alluded to it

2086
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:01,980
but since we started Derby con we've

2087
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,260
raised raised over seven hundred

2088
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:13,199
thousand dollars for charities across

2089
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:14,670
the world and so what I'm gonna do next

2090
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:16,678
is I'm gonna play our closing ceremonies

2091
01:48:14,670 --> 01:48:18,420
and then after that that's it this is

2092
01:48:16,679 --> 01:48:20,250
our last Derby kind but one thing I want

2093
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:22,320
to say is that well Derby con itself is

2094
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:25,650
ending it's just the start of what Derby

2095
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:27,690
con started and I mean I asked on to you

2096
01:48:25,650 --> 01:48:29,190
to continue what Derby con was start

2097
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:31,379
those communities help new people coming

2098
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:32,790
into information security be inclusive

2099
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:34,409
to everybody that's coming into this

2100
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:38,090
industry and make it a better place and

2101
01:48:34,409 --> 01:48:38,089
that's really what you wanted to do here

2102
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:49,369
[Applause]

2103
01:49:01,570 --> 01:49:08,480
