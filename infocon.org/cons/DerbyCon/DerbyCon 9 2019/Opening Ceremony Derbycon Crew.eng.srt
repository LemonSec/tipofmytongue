11
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:47,660
the morning to kick off our final Derby

12
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,759
con but just want to thank everybody for

13
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,399
coming out here who got who went to the

14
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,619
magic show yesterday a lot of people you

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,240
like that was a good yeah good

16
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:58,160
what's interesting is that was not

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,080
staged by the way for Aaron to go up on

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,250
stage in any way shape or form she got a

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,420
lot of questions yesterday was like hey

20
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,700
did Michael select you ahead of time for

21
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,159
that and it wasn't in fact he never

22
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:12,830
touched her her hand in the first place

23
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:14,930
so I thought was really weird she

24
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,670
doesn't like going on stage you there

25
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,470
but that was a great time last night and

26

27
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,540
some folks afterwards as well but

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,230
welcome to Derby con 9 who's been here

29
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,489
all nine years look at all that it's

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:35,350
quite a few people who's been here eight

31
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:39,920
years seven years six five four three

32
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:43,600
two and who's the first one here first

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,399
one look at that that's awesome

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,340
it's amazing I you know we sold out in

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,200
12 seconds that's insane

36
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,810
three thousand tickets in 12 seconds I

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,130
could have never imagined it and if if

38
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,680
anybody doesn't remember the story about

39
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,000
how we started the whole Derby con QR

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,190
code system it was a bunch of hack

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,340
together Python code running on a lanai

42
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:06,140
with some PayPal integration with with

43
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,450
IP n listeners and I wrote the whole

44
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,109
thing just for fun and then a couple

45
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,940
years ago

46
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,250
I decided to release tickets early and

47
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,660
they sold out before the actual time of

48
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,940
the conference is supposed to happen and

49
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,500
I basically burned the internet down so

50
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,060
I decided after that we go to Eventbrite

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,890
it only happened the exact time that was

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,840
supposed to open up at so that we didn't

53
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,029
have those problems in the future but 12

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,340
seconds is a crazy time but that's a

55
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,630
testament to everybody here and the

56
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,430
community and everything that we're

57
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,900
doing out there I'm just a couple things

58
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,710
I wanted to get out of the out of the

59
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,200
gate here the black badges I just want

60
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,970
to mention the black badges your your

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,070
the reason why we did the black badges

62
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,990
this year is because you know obviously

63
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,519
I'm these ones right there on the

64
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,709
attendee badge as the staff badge is all

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,030
the different badges is that we wanted

66
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,580
everybody to be part of derbycon in the

67
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,930
future and while we're going away it

68
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,730
doesn't mean that Derby counts ending in

69
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,640
any way the community itself is alive

70
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,440
and well and we expect great things from

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,059
everybody here to do amazing stuff and

72
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,530
so the black badge is more of a

73
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,020
testament to everybody here who made

74
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,310
Derby con what it was now I want to

75
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,130
throw a caveat out there there's a

76
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,450
number of conferences that have said

77
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,220
that their honor the black badges that

78
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,560
is the awarded black badges so if you

79
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:19,279
got awarded a black badge that is not

80
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,418
everybody here unfortunately okay so if

81
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,738
you got an award a black badge so if

82
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,900
everything basically from last year

83
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:25,700
that's a black badge and below there's a

84
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,260
number of conferences that you don't

85
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,510
have either spawn because of derbycon

86
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,159
or have a lot of derbycon influence that

87
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,440
wanted to show their appreciation and

88
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,510
thank you and so so far you got a black

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,610
badge at Derby con gherkin was the very

90
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:44,150
first one so let's go round of applause

91
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:45,380

94
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,840
in Michigan I go there every single year

fests

98
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,820
[Applause]

99
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,110
check out the Black Hills information

100
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,490
security booth if you're interested more

101
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,900
in the Wild West hacking best I go there

102
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,060
every year as well one of my go-to

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,919
favorites we also have the Texas cyber

104
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:13,680
summit it's the round applause for those

105
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:18,690
folks I'll be there this year Andy Kahn

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:21,120
as well round of applause and not

107
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,650
announced yet just new to this I was

108
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,450
told last night that that I could I can

109
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:30,780
do it from Eric but no Lakan as well

110
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:33,030
will recognize the black badges so when

111
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,590
it comes to community many folks might

112
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,849
not know how Debbie Khan started and

113
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,929
what we were all about and the reason

114
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,770
why we started the conference and I

115
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,720
think it's important to kind of

116
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,880
understand this last derbycon and I'm

117
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,410
not gonna cry at and today I'll cry it's

118
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,140
Sunday and I probably crack something to

119
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,410
be sleeping too but when it comes to why

120
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:52,280
we started derbycon Adrian actually is a

121
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,270
big inspiration for that when Adrian

122
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,640
reached out to me a number of years ago

123
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:58,740
well 10 years ago geez with Pete I was

124
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,260
27 years old 28 years old me that when I

125
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:06,450
started to recon which is insane I got

126
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:08,730
kids over there yes but when we started

127
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,590
derbycon really what spawned it is

128
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,000
adrian reached out to a number of us and

129
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,460
said hey i'm looking at doing a free

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,710
Metasploit class just to do it because I

131
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,930
want to get folks into medicine and to

132
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,620
teach Metasploit over at I was at

133
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,350
Churchill Downs is it at the brown the

134
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,600
brown hotel that's right and uh and so

135
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,950
you know we decided to do that new and a

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,240
journey that was hoping for like 15 20

137
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,250
people end up having over a hundred

138
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
people to teach free Metasploit classes

139
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,130
all day long it was free it was anybody

140
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,119
can come and we wanted to do it for the

141
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,210
community we wanted to do it for

142
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,070
everybody else and afterwards we went to

143
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,450
a pizza shop and were like hey you know

144
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,390
we really liked that there was there was

145
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,710
no you know egos there was no cliques

146
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,690
there was nothing it was just teaching

147
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,159
and learning InfoSec and it was bringing

148
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,600
new people into the industry that didn't

149
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,220
know Metasploit and didn't understand

150
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
what Metasploit was and how to do

151
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,580
different things and to bring new people

152
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,560
together to learn and do amazing things

153
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,060
and share your experiences and so we

154
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,130
said at the pizza shop and it was Alex

155
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,710
kah Adriene myself

156
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,990
Martin and and a few other folks around

157
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,190
the table as well and we decided hey we

158
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,960
should start a conference out here in

159
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,980
Louisville Kentucky and it would be

160
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,479
about the community

161
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,030
and I think there's a big difference

162
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,590
between the industry which we're all a

163
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,299
part of this industry that we're

164
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,099
creating and figure out new things every

165
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,630
day but what's important to understand

166
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,430
is that the community is alive and well

167
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,750
and the community isn't one community

168
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,180
there's multiple communities that make

169
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,710
up what information security is it's

170
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,180
people that are focusing on hardware

171
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,219
hacking and lockpick villages and

172
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,510
Incident Response and blue team's and

173
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,920
red teams and everything else that makes

174
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,690
up this industry to make the world a

175
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,460
better place and that's really what

176
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,680
derbycon was is about multiple

177
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,359
communities coming together to try to do

178
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,110
try to do the world and try to make the

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,150
world a better place

180
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,920
and you know we did that it's amazing

181
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,690
the influence that the conference has

182
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,310
had and that's a testament to everybody

183
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,230
here in this room everybody that's ever

184
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,210
been to derbycon in the past you know I

185
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,400
hear a time and time again Derby kind

186
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,590
you know started their career you know

187
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,929
Derby con was an influence in how they

188
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,849
got into InfoSec they learned what to do

189
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,440
and to go into it and to get their jobs

190
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,090
in the future people we've seen people's

191
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,469
lives that were suffering from

192
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,570
depression and things like that there's

193
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,790
a lot of things that Derby con and this

194
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,320
community has a huge influence on and we

195
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,210
talked about what we wanted to do with

196
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,270
Derby con and ultimately why we decided

197
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,520
this was the last year is that we we've

198
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,890
done our mission we've already created

199
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,330
an industry a community of people that

200
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,820
want to make the world a better place

201
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:30,990
regardless of race regardless of gender

202
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:33,150
regardless of religion you come together

203
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,640
as one to help each other out and that's

204
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,199
what Derby con is all about each year we

205
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,000
raise more and more for charity as we

206
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,750
humanly possibly could you know this is

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,050
a profit conference right so it's not a

208
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,850
501 3 C but everything that we did all

209
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,410
the money that we made after all the

210
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,850
expenses either went to the next year to

211
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,079
pronate or gave it away to charity and

212
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,210
this year gonna do the exact same thing

213
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,530
so at the end of the conference after

214
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,580
everything ever to pay for the hotel and

215
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,050
everything else all the money that we

216
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,190
make from Derby con is going right into

217
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,439
Charities of our choosing so we'll

218
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,860
announce those at Derby con as well and

219
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,190
again just our yeah just

220
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:11,840
[Applause]

221
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,190
derbycon was never about money it was

222
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,750
always about the community and that's

223
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,950
that's something that I can hold true

224
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,460
everybody here at the table can hold

225
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,250
true

226
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,450
we got offers to sell derbycon and you

227
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,190
know it could have been hey we could

228
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,840
have kept derbycon going more and more

229
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,670
and more but we didn't feel that it

230
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,750
would give back to the community the way

231
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,790
that we wanted to it that it wouldn't be

232
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,890
the same as we wanted to so we wanted to

233
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,449
go out on a high note with this year and

234
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,540
you know we all have kids we all have

235
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,850
families it's we've grown as derbycon

236
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,980
has grown as well and it's amazing it to

237
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:42,800
see Big Dave at Derby con one when I was

238
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,020
there much heavier Dave and to see all

239
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,640
of us growed Dave didn't have a beard

240
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:51,890
here which is amazing it took him nine

241
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:54,439
years to grow that but Jason Jason here

242
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,510

243
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,530

Dave

278
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,200
well Dave asked me what 9 10 years ago

279
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,150
we need a seat here I said ok I don't

280
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,950
know what that meant so I had to figure

281
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,880
out how to do it how many CDF's have I

282
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,870
played in my life up to this day zero

283
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,800
people are like how can that be

284
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,630
so I modeled this

285
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,949
ETF after a pen test and I also wanted

286
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,990
to keep things in mind I didn't want it

287
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,000
to be qualifiers I wanted to be equal

288
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,399
for everyone so there's kids that want

289
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,959
to play we have lower level you know

290
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,600
beginner exercises all the way up to

291
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,790
zero days and other things like that

292
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,070
it's kind of a flag based pen test type

293
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,380
deal we are downstairs past Starbucks

294
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:42,110
down the escalators on the right side

295
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,300
and the left side and salon F and also I

296
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,209
believe it's the wind room so that

297
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,130

298
00:11:47,209 --> 00:12:00,319

00:11:49,130 --> 00:12:01,970
down there okay in your book you can see

300
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,440
that the one room is open with certain

301
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,149
hours and then across the hall straight

302
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,620
down from the escalator on the left that

303
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,750
one is actually gonna be open 24 hours

304
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:16,640

mental health and awareness huge thing I

318
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,529
think for the for the conference and I

319
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,060

320
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,709
conferences can be overwhelming we going

321
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,569
be going through a lot of things those

322
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:51,109
are things that I'd recommend Trent

323
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:53,420

329
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:15,529
hey I would never met before

330
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,820
here's an ice and they would drink it

331
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,079
and that would give them a nice to go

332
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,410
ice someone else so it's kind of like a

333
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:27,170
family ordeal and there was someone oh

334
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:28,819
yeah those two guys right there so

335
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,979
there's also this thing where people

336
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,100
just asked me to go ice people

337
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,810

338
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:41,339
the guy right here okay you guys up but

339
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:46,349
there is protection for its really good

340
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:47,910
after you brush your teeth but so how

341
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,500
the ice works is like you don't have to

342
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,139
drink it you can always say no Poli but

343
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,610
you can also buy banned protection it's

344
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,490
five dollars it goes to the charities

345

that are here it's just a fun game and

346
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:01,399
but if someone has a band you can also

347
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:05,790
buy an extra band to trump their

348
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:07,199
protection and you know they have to

349
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,399

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,839
while at the conference you know

397
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,120
obviously you're in a large group

398
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,960
setting of people and with large group

399
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,190
settings you know things

400
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,170
can come our eyes but we have you know

401
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,240
security all around we have police

402
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,410
officers here at all given times don't

403
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,600
obviously anticipated thing every year

404
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,010
it's been a phenomenal place but just in

405
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,620
case for your safety we have folks here

406
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,600
near our security staff yesterday I had

407
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,650
two small incidents which were carrying

408
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,940
people up to the rooms because they had

409
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,250
drinking too much which is perfectly

410
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,650
fine we're happy to do that but you know

411
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,060
I fireman there's a story from the Wu

412
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,810
Tang year was that two years ago three

413
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,670
years ago three years ago somebody had

414
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,439
passed out outside and I fireman's

415
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,579
carried him back to the room and I still

416
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,020
to this day they probably don't know

417
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,510
that Dave picked them up environments

418
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:29,189
carried them to their room it wasn't

419
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:31,230
Aaron but but you know you know

420
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,520
obviously drink responsibly be careful

421
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,960
in large group settings with drinks and

422
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,010
things like that cover your drinks up if

423
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,020
you don't know where the drinks come

424
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,400
from you know obviously you know don't

425
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,660
don't drink them they're coming from the

426
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,010
staff or the bar things like that

427
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,089
obviously that that's that's fine

428
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:46,860
how about drink what's that the ice is

429
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,870
safe it's it's locked into steel or

430
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,720
aluminum can I'm sure it's safe I don't

431
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,470
know how you went but you know just be

432
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,680
safe when you're when you're going

433
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,540
around different things and before

434
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,650
before I kick up the last last part here

435
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,329
does anybody want to say anything about

436
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:04,639
their experiences at derbycon and what

437
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,640
it means to them the design yeah Kim

438
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:16,370
Kyle Jason Jason I'm gonna call that

439
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,030
when it speaks up here all the time oh

440
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:27,179
my gosh

441
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:29,430
alright that's actually true listen if

442
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:32,040
you if you don't know these folks here

443
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:35,510
put on an incredible amount of time and

444
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,510
effort to make this happen so

445
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:46,059
I think a lot of folks expect like hey

446
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,929
when you get here the stage is built and

447
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:48,850
everything else it just magically

448
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:49,960
happens right it's kinda like a dream

449
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,428
and he gets here and he sets up his

450
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,769
video it's like magically this power

451
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,059
right you know but but there's there's a

452
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:56,409
lot of things that go into planning a

453
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,330
conference so we start about eight

454
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,129
months prior to getting this going and

455
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,629

458
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,470
we're doing at a given times and

459
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:10,090
orchestrating planning cute this and

460
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,609

00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:15,519
amount of people donating their time and

463
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,949
effort to really help the conference in

464
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,629
the community itself and Jason from a

465
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,029
sound and AV perspective and just

466

00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:26,169
Martin and Lake literally they built

468
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:27,700
this whole thing that you see here I

469
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:29,320
mean it from scratch like there was no

470
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,879
stage here but there's no stage here at

471
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,590
all times we build the stage we build

472
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:33,789
the lights and we build the sound and

473
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,080
everything else and it takes a lot of

474
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,730
time and they were you know they're here

475
