8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,170
tricked you that being said I came to

9

Derby cotton rather late in its life and

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,060
it has done so much for me personally as

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,640
well as professionally and for that I

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:41,670
want to say thank you to hacking Dave in

13

to be free and open source and I'll post

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,859
it right there on my github on top of

21
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:05,040
that I successfully held a rogue hacker

22
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:11,760
style meetup in which I gave away 45

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:15,119
pounds of pulled pork yesterday that I

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,450
cooked from my hotel room I'm gonna tell

25
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,850
you how so a real quick plug in

26
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,479
Cincinnati we have a lot of great IT and

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,369
IT security groups that just service our

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,380
community four of us have a real tight

29
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,930
alliance we don't care which groups that

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,158

groups here so if you ever in town come

39
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,409
cooking your hotel them well quite

40
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,899
frankly cookie is fun and when you're

41
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,939
the chef you can make exactly what you

42
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,149
want and I've recently been doing a lot

43
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,148
more of these types of events traveling

44
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,799
to conferences in my career and when you

45
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,509
travel a lot of it I have to do on my

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,979
personal dime as I'm sure many of you

47
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,318
guys have to do and there are fixed

48
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,970
costs such as travel such as hotels such

49
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,679
as the conference talk where

50
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,140
make my dollar stretch a little bit more

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,630
is actually going through in with my

52
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,549
food budget and finally because we're

53
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,549
hackers and we love to do crazy things

54
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:27,960
with technology so how do I find myself

55
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,330
speaking in front of all of you and

56
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,230
thank you for taking time out this makes

57
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,150
me so happy

58
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,890
it's it all goes back to circle city con

59
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,570
you see Circle City con was the first

60
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,540
hacker style conference that has invited

61
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,970
to speak at and I gave my Star Wars data

62
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,590
government talk and I was thinking you

63
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,330
know I've got a lot of guys that are

64
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,010
going to be there and I want to do

65
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,170
something special and just really

66
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,260
celebrate the community that we have in

67
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,700
Cincinnati and I thought well you know I

68
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,920
could take everyone out to dinner but

69
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,350
downtown Indianapolis it's pretty pricey

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,809
pretty quick and I thought well everyone

71
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,519
likes my barbecue maybe I could just do

72
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,410
a pork but I thought well you know what

73
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,060
there are there's going to be too much

74
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,700
leftover so I called my good friend Matt

75
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,520
he runs the Cincinnati sent us cig he

76
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,190
has been my personal speaking mentor our

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,769
friendship really grew at my first Derby

78
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,160
con Derby con 7:00 the Derby con that

79
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:25,560
births

80
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:29,970
Trevor into this world Tuesday but it's

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,130
because of Matt giving me support and a

82
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,140
little bit of a push that I've been able

83
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,480
to do some of the coolest things I've

84
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,760
done in the past two years so thank you

85
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,850
so I called Matt I said Matt I've got a

86
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,280
crazy idea and Matt said I'm listening

87
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,959
he said how about we go through a net

88
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,420
circle city con we hold a rogue need up

89
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,830
to promote our groups he's like yeah but

90
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,530
how are you going to get people to come

91
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:56,880
I said Matt you don't understand in the

92
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:59,040
80 - you pee and he laughed maniacally

93
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,420
and said I'll be glad to chip in and I

94
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,280
don't know how it started but as we were

95
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,790
setting up we were just riffing with

96
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,430
each other

97
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,579
what would a talk like or what would a

98
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,100
CFP for this style of talk look like and

99
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,700
that made me promise that I'd submitted

100
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,459
tutor B and guys that's how I got or

101
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,899
invited to come here and present to you

102
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,310
so first let's talk a little bit about

103
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,799
smoking but I had a good conversation

104
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,240
with hacking Dave and we need to he

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
insist that we talk a little bit about

106
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,270
safety

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,550
never leave your smoker unattended while

108
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,440
it's working always have tools to put

109
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,140
your fire out in case something were to

110
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,200
happen wash your hands before and after

111
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,909
you touch any type of proteins clean and

112
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,890
protect your surfaces and cloths are

113
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,080
your friend and one of the easiest ways

114
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,630
to level up your food game is simply to

115
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,680
buy high quality meat probes other than

116
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,480
that have fun be adventurous so when

117
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,990
we're doing a hot smoke we usually want

118
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,570
to cook between 225 and 275 and

119
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,990
regardless what type of smoker you use

120
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,570
whether it's a side load or a pellet

121
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:06,240
comodo and Electric you really only have

122
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,840
to control just three things to control

123
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,830
your smoker

124
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,599
the fuel the heat and the oxygen if you

125
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,270
take away any one of those components

126
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,390
you're going to extinguish your fire now

127
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,280
unfortunately I have not found a safe

128
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,780
method to use a hot smoker in a hotel

129
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,820
room so what I'm going to show you how

130
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,890
to build is a cold smoker and I actually

131
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,390
brought a prototype of my cold smoker

132
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,250
down here after this talk I'll be out

133
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,860
there if you want to take a look at it

134
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,500
and where as a hot smoker is designed to

135
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,130
go through and to cook food all your

136
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:42,300
smoking a cold smoker imparts delicious

137
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:44,000
smoke flavor while not directly cooking

138
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,320
it so you will need a more traditional

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,010
cooking surface to go through and finish

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,230
your cook but once again these can be

141
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,760
made very cheap very easily about ten

142
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,800
dollars and you probably have most of

143
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,430
the parts in your home at this point in

144
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,380
time already but with that being said

145
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,290
the first thing that we need to do is we

146
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,020
need our fuel source so I generally use

147
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,210
wood pellet chips about $10 a box you

148
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,810
just need a handful and you can go

149
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,419
through and you can wrap a nice thin

150
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,280
aluminum wood pellet cigar and then what

151
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:19,530
I always do is I rip off the top end I

152
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,780
pour some chips out I put in an

153
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,460
all-natural fire starter and then I put

154
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,010
some more tips or pellets right on top

155
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,849
of that I then will use something like a

156
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:32,250
pen or a knife or a pencil and I'll put

157
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,020
a copious amount of holes in it to make

158
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,150
sure that the air can go through because

159
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,250
the only thing that that actual little

160
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,820
wood pellet cigar is supposed to do is

161
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,770
to try

162
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,050
hold the chips together in fact you can

163
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,299
actually make something much like this

164
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,980
if you want to continue using it now

165
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,900
this type of a smoker is going to be

166
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,270
perfect for if you're going to a cookout

167
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,719
a tailgate if you're going to a park

168
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,130
this is a great little smoker and the

169
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,770
next thing is we need to work on our

170
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:01,050
tins so I always like on the bottom

171
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,120
right to put a 1 inch by one inch hole

172
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,040
and when I cut these holes out I only

173
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,770
cut 3 sides that gives me a little flap

174
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,810
so I can go and use to control how much

175
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,120
oxygen is going into the smoker right

176
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,740
now too and then on the top part on the

177
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,320
top left I go through and I put another

178
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,360
1 inch by one inch hole and that being

179
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,849
said I just go through and I use little

180
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,470
metal paper clips to go through and to

181
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,010
secure the top and the bottom to each

182
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,260
other inside no secret here I just have

183
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,240
that little wood pellet cigar that we

184
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,849
went through and shaped I put the food

185
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,100
in there generally for a nice light

186
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,080
smoky flavor you're looking for about 15

187
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,490
minutes if you want to go through and be

188
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,260
a little bit more adventurous a little

189
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,700
more bold you can go through and leave

190
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,700
it in there for 30 minutes one thing

191
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,950
that this is also good for is like

192
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,680
cheese's or if any of you like old

193
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:53,300
fashions right - you try a smoked old

194
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,270
fashioned it is delectable I guarantee

195
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,160
but that being said when you're working

196
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,690
with this type of smoker you're really

197
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,000
controlling everything by how much

198
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,000
oxygen is getting into the smoker if you

199
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,440
have too much oxygen all the wood

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,940
pellets are going to go through and

201
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,250
ignite and you're going to have a little

202
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,510
bit of a fire inside too little your

203
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,560
pellets are going to go out so this is

204
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,219
where you're going to have to go through

205
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,620
play and experience is going to be your

206
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,330
best teacher you can notice that in this

207
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,790
pitcher I've actually gone through and

208
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,650
raised it up about 4 to 6 inches using

209
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,860
whatever's necessary that just helps me

210
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:36,780
protect the in or the surface and as you

211
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:39,599
can see it does a darn good job so let's

212
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,728
talk about how I pulled off I meet up

213
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,099
here at Derby well I had some help

214
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,980
so with the help of my friends I was

215
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,200
able to serve 45 pounds of pulled pork

216
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,750
two steak dinners in one chicken dinner

217
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,890
we gave out one

218
00:08:50,750 --> 00:09:03,350
in 30 lunches at a total price point of

219
00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:05,420
150 dollars how did I do it I used the

220
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,300
new cooking technique called Suvi it's

221
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,829
roughly translated from French to under

222
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,620
vacuum and this is something that's

223
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:15,110
really come a long way and in popularity

224
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:18,200
in the past couple years especially with

225
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,570
the IOT revolution with sous-vide

226
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,580
cooking what you actually do is you

227
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:27,110
place your food in a pouch and/or glass

228
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,540
container if it's more of a liquid or

229
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,520
gel and you submerge it in water the

230
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,740
actual sous-vide device will go through

231
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,590
and hold the temperature of the water at

232
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,820
a very very very precise temperature now

233
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,310
because you're cooking at lower

234
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,540
temperatures with this technique your

235
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,489
cook times are going to be a little bit

236
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,980
longer but it's also very predictable

237
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,380
and very forgiving now when you're going

238
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,390
through and cooking traditional meats on

239
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,370
traditional surfaces if you're trying to

240
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,730
get that perfect medium-rare on a steak

241
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,530
you have a very short safe window to

242
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,330
take that actual steak

243
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,550
off of the grill if you take it off too

244
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,500
soon not cooked enough take it off to

245
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,609
wait well it's going to be a little bit

246
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,990
on the dry side with Suvi as the meat

247
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,100
the proteins are going through and

248
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,600
cooking they're naturally going to sweat

249
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,420
it just happens traditional cooking

250
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,730
surfaces you lose that flavor but since

251
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,370
the food's in its own little pouch you

252
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:22,040
reserved it and so your food your steak

253
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:25,310
your chicken your ribs are taking a nice

254
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,060
little sauna within its little container

255
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,380
and it makes your meat absolutely moist

256
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,180
delectable and with something like ribs

257
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,730
you're going to get hyperextension of

258
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,219
the meat off of the bone sometimes up to

259
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,810
two to three inches which is great now

260
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,190
another benefit of sous-vide cooking is

261
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,859
it's very mathematical it's very

262
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,660
predictable it's also very forgiving so

263
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,900
if I cook a steak which will take about

264
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,480
one hour I have once the one hour mark

265
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,020
comes up I have 30 additional minutes to

266
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,270
take it out of its little sauna before

267
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,120
it goes into an unsafe zone which means

268
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,069
that if life happens that's cool just

269
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,180
deal with it and get back to your

270
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,790
cooking when you're ready

271
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,800
I also find this technique to be very

272
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,050
good what I'm making vast amounts of

273
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,180
barbecue there's a couple times where at

274
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,609
home I've actually served at the local

275
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,769
Issa group and it's been straight now

276
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,379
one thing you do have to realize is with

277
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,990
this methodology certain foods work

278
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:22,999
better with a extra sear on it not only

279
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,610
is it visually appealing but it also

280
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:27,290
gives the meat the dish that little

281
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:31,100
something extra soft show you how to do

282
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,839
that too so your first decision is if

283
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,850
you want to try it out do you want to

284
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,769
try do you want to buy or do you want to

285
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,540
build if you want to go through and just

286
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:40,249
try this methodology out but I tell

287
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,009
people all the time is take a pan that

288
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:46,100
you already use take a an actual

289
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:48,800
thermometer go through and very slowly

290
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,870
bring and hold the water to your desired

291
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,579
temperature for about 15 minutes before

292
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:55,220
you actually start your cook then just

293
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:56,899
do a standard sous-vide cook take it out

294
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,749
and you're going to be fine

295
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:03,249
recently the su V inverse emergent

296
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:03,249
cookers have come down drastically

297
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,610
improving care that actually will show

298
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:12,800
you how to build one using a Raspberry

299
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:15,230
Pi in that one is pretty awesome so guys

300
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,050
this is how I cook my food I had to cook

301
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,879
stations I had one set at 145 for the

302
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:23,649
pulled pork and the chicken I had

303
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:23,649
another one set up Oh

304
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:36,559
oh sweet

305
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:36,559
[Music]

306
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,230
[Applause]

307
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,210
you know I think I'm gonna start

308
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:52,850
drinking them all this way I think we

309
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:55,250
need to start call this Kennedy style so

310
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,470
one thing they say when I introduce

311
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,959
people to Sufi cooking is don't be

312
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:03,440
afraid to go through into pack in the

313
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,329
flavor my friends and why is that well I

314
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,649
already told you as the meat naturally

315
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,810
comes up it's going to go through it's

316
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:10,520
going to sweat and as it goes through

317
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,170
and as it's sweat some of the rub it's

318
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,459
going to fall off now it's not lost

319
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,500
because remember it's still in that

320
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,819
little pouch it's dissolved and it's

321
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:22,399
going to naturally work its way deeply

322
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,459
into the actual meat and it is going to

323
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,380
be delectable now when you're cooking

324
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,180
Suvi you have an option where you can go

325
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,620
through and you can use a vacuum seal

326
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,870
bag that's the preferred because

327
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,550
remember the more air in the bag that's

328
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,350
going to add as an insulator too much

329
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:41,060
here and you're not going to have a good

330
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:44,270
time when it comes to using a commercial

331
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:47,569
single use zipper bag what I always

332
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,970
suggest is place the food in there work

333
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,339
as much air as you I can out of it then

334
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,380
go through and zip it up about 75% of

335
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:55,670
the way submerge most of the bag

336
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,170
underneath the water the water is

337
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,630
naturally going to help force more air

338
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:02,300
out work the rest of the air out go

339
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,700
through finish closing it remove the bag

340
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,319
from the water bring the water up to

341
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,180
temperature when we're talking about

342
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:14,029
chicken it's a much higher cook right so

343
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:16,400
it's 140 to 176 degrees now the actual

344
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:19,040
temperature it's going to vary based on

345
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:23,270
the type of meat whether it's fresh or

346
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,010
frozen as well as the thickness of it so

347
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,779
there's plenty of resources online this

348
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,540
has become very popular the past couple

349
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:32,720
years and all of the information is out

350
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,540
there personally I like about 149 for

351
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,760
chicken breast that is not frozen and

352
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,560
about one inch thick now it might go in

353
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,230
one inch thick but they usually come out

354
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,420
like over two inches thick they are

355
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,470
absolutely delectable and it will cook

356
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,270
in about an hour

357
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,700
once it's done chickens one of those

358
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,220
proteins that really really really

359
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,950
benefits from a good sear so what I'd go

360
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,250
through and what I do is at home I'll

361
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,960
use a hot pan with a little bit of oil

362
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:03,170
3045 seconds per side and you're gonna

363
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,920
have a good day if you go through and if

364
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,930
you are not at home there is there are

365
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,510
special adapters that can fit on two

366
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:14,810
small propane tanks that are used for

367
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,760
portable grills and those actually work

368
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,530
really well not only are they fun to

369
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,490
play with but they really give you a

370
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:24,560
real nice sear and finally what I used

371
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,740
because I as a hacker and I was living

372
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,469
off of the hotel I wrapped the chicken

373
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:35,630
in aluminium foil and I used the iron

374
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:40,610
for about a minute per side I kid you

375
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:43,760
not on the highest setting I could I

376
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:46,820
juiced it up now guys I don't know about

377
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,360
you but I love love love myself a good

378
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,430
steak

379
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,220
and when it comes to steaks I'm much

380
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,260
more of a traditionalist I like salt I

381
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,450
like pepper and I added a little bit of

382
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,490
rosemary just for the wow factor I

383
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,650
wanted to have a couple of proteins that

384
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,770
were available for people that might not

385
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:06,500
eat pork for one reason or another and

386
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:08,870
I'm glad I added a chicken option and a

387
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,020
steak option but just like with the

388
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:15,320
chicken I put it in a vacuum sealed bag

389
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:18,189
and I froze it I brought everything that

390
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,900
I brought was frozen and I kept it in

391
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,490
coolers under ice the entire time until

392
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,290
was ready for me to go through and to

393
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,580
cook with steaks you have a much lower

394
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,959
cook temperature so your cook

395
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,910
temperature for steaks is going to be

396
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:34,040
about 122 to 154 now me I like a good

397
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,890
medium-rare steak and I found for about

398
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,579
an inch thick fresh steak it'll cook in

399
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:42,230
about an hour at 129 once it comes out

400
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,110
you can use one of those three

401
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,660
methodologies to go through and to

402
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:50,270
actually put a nice sear this time I

403
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,089
used the iron methodology again I didn't

404
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:57,650
want to push things too far by using my

405
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:59,930
propane tank attachment tool now for the

406
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:03,380
star and what I got people raving about

407
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:08,780
my Lynchburg style pulled pork

408
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:11,300
I picked up four pork butts and when I'm

409
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,399
smoking I chose to use my electric I'm

410
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,470
still learning how to use my comodo just

411
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,000
like switching from one sim to another

412
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,010
you kind of have to learn your tools

413
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,349
your techniques and your tactics same is

414
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,780
true with the smokers my friend but with

415
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:26,208
that being said I usually allocate at

416
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,430
225 a nice low and slow ninety minutes

417
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:31,040
per pound now because I was doing so

418
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:34,670
many at the same time it actually ended

419
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:38,149
up being closer to 110 minutes per pound

420
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:41,390
of the largest but now immediately after

421
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,970
I went through and I opened each of the

422
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,590
pork butts I patted them down dry and I

423
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,030
wanted to I mean this is Derby con if

424
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,040
I'm going to go I'm going to go big

425
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,139
right so I wanted to add that extra wow

426
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,879
factor so I took about 8 ounces of

427
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,010
molasses and I cut it with some soy

428
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,440
sauce and just hand mixed it the

429
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,060
molasses in it of itself is so thick

430
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,040
that it would go through and block the

431
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,570
smoke from deeply penetrating which is

432
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,639
why I wanted to go through and I wanted

433
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,350
to cut it a little bit I got it just so

434
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,530
it's a little about the viscosity of

435
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,879
water and then I just simply hand rubbed

436
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,680
each of those pork butts

437
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,050
which is why down in the lower left hand

438
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,820
you can see that they have a beautiful

439
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,570
golden color now this is going to do a

440
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,250
couple things

441
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,320
the first thing that's going to do is as

442
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,970
it smokes it's going to caramelize and

443
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,790
it's going to be very delectable the

444
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,550
second it actually allows me to pack on

445
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:31,250
more of the rub as possible and because

446
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,409
of I'm packing more and more rub on that

447
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,320
is actually going through and mean I'm

448
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:39,020
going to have an absolutely fantastic

449
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,990
bark or crust depending on which school

450
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:45,200
of barbecue you are coming from now when

451
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,670
it comes to cooking a good pork butt you

452
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,800
need to go through and do you need to

453
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:53,380
shoot for an internal temperature of

454
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:56,510
somewhere between 195 and the mid 200s

455
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,490
personally I try to split it at 198 you

456
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,170
can see they have them some nice

457
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,270
temperature probes in each one of the

458
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,520
but so I can understand how they are

459
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,260
each going through and working each pork

460
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,550
but each piece of meat that you cook

461
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,310
it's going to behave slightly

462
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,899
differently so I did definitely go

463
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,029
through and leveled up my game when I

464
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,830
went through and upgraded to

465
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:20,509
having multiple good high quality

466
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:23,840
sensors once each pork buck was came up

467
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:25,909
to 198 I took just a normal baking pan

468
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,129
I removed the pork butt from the smoker

469
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:30,499
and I took it inside and just let it

470
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:33,379
rest for about 90 minutes now this guy's

471
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:35,960
is where the fun kicks in there is no

472
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:37,759
wrong way to go through and to pull a

473
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,649
pork butt there are many ways that you

474
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,259
can do it some people like to use tongs

475
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:44,899
some people like to use Forks I would

476
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:48,049
assert that the most fun way is to go

477
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:49,758
through and use barbecue knuckles it's

478
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:51,259
kind of fun you put them on and you feel

479
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,460
like Wolverine if instead of fighting

480
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:55,489
villains you're actually going through

481
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,830
and you know while making barbecue and

482
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:59,989
so what I do is I'll then take the pork

483
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,428
butt over to my prep station and I've

484
00:19:59,989 --> 00:20:04,039
got a set for a pan that's just for

485
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:06,080
pulling scoop out about a sixth of the

486
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:08,359
actual pork butt I'll put it in the

487
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,309
polling station I'll use my left claw to

488
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:13,369
hold the meat directly up against the

489
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,418
wall and I'll come in down and out with

490
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:17,869
my right claw

491
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:19,460
several times until it's all pulled if I

492
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:21,619
go through and I'm not happy with how

493
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,779
pulled I'll break it back up into the

494
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:27,529
center of rotated 90 degrees and repeat

495
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:30,019
at that point I then went through and I

496
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:33,979
used vacuum sealed bags I put it

497
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:37,700
directly into the freezer so when it

498
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:39,649
came time on Friday before I went to

499
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,749
lunch I went through and I filled my

500
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:45,228
giant fill station and I brought it up

501
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:47,089
to temp 140 I started out with as hot of

502
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:49,609
water as I could get out of the shower

503
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:51,080
and it took about thirty minutes for all

504
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:54,859
of that water to come up to temperature

505
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:58,279
and I went through and I simply put the

506
00:20:54,859 --> 00:21:00,379
meat in and I walked away now at that

507
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,659
point every three or four hours I'd come

508
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:04,968
back to the hotel room and I top off the

509
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:06,710
bath because let me tell you my

510
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:08,570
container wasn't almost not big enough

511
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,429
to go through and to cook all of the

512
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,460
pork but at the end of the day I

513
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:16,159
successfully served forty five pounds of

514
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,200
pulled pork two steak dinners one

515
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,080
chicken dinner and I want to go through

516
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,519
say thank you for all being part of this

517
