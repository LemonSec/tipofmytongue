1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
something that he said to me mean my job

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:08,490
drop he said we're building nuclear

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:11,879
reactors and we are on the edge of a

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,700
cliff and just recently have they

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,300
started to implement security measures

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,448
that concern malware attacks that

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,000
concern internet adjacent systems taking

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,869
into consideration those factors in the

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,380
design cycle so today what I'm going to

10
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,510
talk about is some vulnerabilities that

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,550
tenable found in the last year or so

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,309
we've found about a dozen critical

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,319
vulnerabilities in different ICS and

14
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,260
SCADA products hardware and software

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,629
they're critical because they're pretty

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,940
authentic ation remote code execution on

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,480
production software production hardware

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,579
and so I'll talk I'm going to talk not

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,050
about not about all of them I'll talk

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,859
about four of them in detail and then

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:02,059
we'll go into an attack scenario and

22
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:02,059
we'll blow up a nuclear power plant

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:10,290
first one in Siemens huge manufacturer

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,500
Siemens makes a software product called

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,000
step seven step seven is used

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,580
industry-wide it's been around forever

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,909
they rebranded it recently as Ti a

28
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,590
totally integrated automation portal and

29
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,990
it's used in all aspects of ICS

30
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,780
development and operation from design

31
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:32,789
phase to implementation all the way down

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,110
to operation Tia portal has a suite of

33
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,960
simulation tools

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,869
it's got Diagnostics and telemetry which

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,298
are used in operation in production as

36
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,170
well as energy management for use in

37
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,509
operation and it's built by and for

38
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,310
engineers it's made for the integrators

39
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,079
and all the way down to the people

40
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,799
actually operating the technology at the

41
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,589
plant level so the first of all in this

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,619
Vall net we found is in this software

43
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,320
exists in the authentication package Tia

44
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:08,128
portal has a server which is implemented

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,478
by nodejs and the basically it

46
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,179
implements functionality for

47
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,590
authenticating web users and then

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,950
swapping over to

49
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,200
a web stop WebSockets protocol after

50
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,569
authentication when it switched over to

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,369
WebSockets however they don't use the

52
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,399
token that's generated from the SSL

53
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,530
identification so the result is that any

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,849
attacker can just start sending

55
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,540
WebSockets commit and skipping

56
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,290
authentication and of course all

57
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,010
administrative functionalities are

58
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,450
included in the WebSockets protocol so

59
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,000
the result of that is that you can do a

60
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,750
number of things but the best thing to

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,459
do is to just start a firmware update

62
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:50,160
and you can control and specify the

63
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:54,329
firmware update server so an attacker

64
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,680
can modify can use this to run basically

65
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,959
any binary served from their own

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,790
controlled server some other things that

67
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,569
you can do with it is to modify user

68
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:06,359
permissions or create a new user modify

69
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,129
existing user credentials or you could

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,390
just basically change application proxy

71
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:13,768
settings to collect system information

72
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,929
and I would stress again like this is

73
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:21,209
this is an in production software suite

74
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:24,359
used all over the place all right number

75
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,870
two so Schneider Electric they make in

76
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,400
the soft web studio and the and earlier

77
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,370
this year we found a bunch of

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,590
vulnerabilities in in do soft but this

79
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,290
one was kind of the most critical one to

80
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,510
where there's a vulnerability in the

81
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,970
command process the command processing

82
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:45,269
functionality where you can actually end

83
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,660
up overflowing the stack the command is

84
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,840
called the command 66 it's this message

85
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,760
which can be sent by an unauthenticated

86
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,180
remote user and it's used to specify a

87
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,840
database a database configuration update

88
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,389
server so the file that's sent back by

89
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,569
the database update server has the

90
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:10,500
ability the ability to set specific

91
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:14,790
database configuration parameters the

92
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:18,149
problem exists though that the Indus hoc

93
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:23,280
web studio executes the engine has this

94
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:26,000
capability to parse user commands so it

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,739
takes these these these

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,850
command and execute them on the

97
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,160
operating system as the administrator

98
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,590
and this happens because the developers

99
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,560
basically overlooked the engines markup

100
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,900
parsing so as in the soft parses the

101
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,150
malicious update configuration file it

102
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,960
executed those wrapped bracket commands

103
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,349
in the administrator shell and then we

104
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,099
have a proof of concept of this on our

105
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:57,620
tenable github repository where a fake

106
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,240
SMB servers created the database

107
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,250
configuration is requested from the into

108
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,500
soft server it requests a malicious

109
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,380
configuration file and then runs it and

110
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,330
we use that to just run calculator on

111
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,680
the Indus off Webb's web studio server

112
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,409
all right a third vulnerability this one

113
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,810
is also in Schneider Electric this time

114
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,690
in hardware so the modicon quantum is a

115
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,669
family of PLC's and they're produced by

116
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,530
Schneider and you use all over across

117
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,659
different industries they're designed to

118
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,309
be modular and interchange in the

119
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,919
housing depending on the needs of the

120
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,440
application one of the one of the bones

121
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,870
that we found there were several of them

122
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,560
but one of them was authentication

123
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,240
bypass to where the communication the

124
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,280
communications module the ethernet

125
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,360
module that you slide into them to the

126
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,400
modicon PLC's

127
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,560
allows an attacker to basically

128
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,349
administer the device for free you can

129
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,300
change and modify user credentials

130
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:57,110
administrator administrator credentials

131
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,180
without authentication and then here is

132
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,729
the proof of concept that we wrote for

133
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:06,140
that there she is

134
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:08,960
see zero day and ICS is very easy and it

135
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:12,710
uses this hidden service API basically

136
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,060
to just reset the administrator password

137
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:20,320
and then you can just login because

138
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:24,500
that's a set password all right last one

139
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:27,110
rockwell automation rslinx classic made

140
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,169
by rockwell automation implements

141
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,150
Ethernet IP which encapsulates the

142
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:34,729
common industrial protocol sip messages

143
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,039
and so basically the sip messages have

144
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:39,150
this 24 byte header followed by command

145
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,669
specific data the

146
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,039
list the command and the length of the

147
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,780
commune specific data however the

148
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,430
application doesn't validate the command

149
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,840
data length so it doesn't the

150
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,430
application doesn't actually check to

151
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,590
verify that the data it's processing is

152
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,419
as long as it said it would be which

153
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,820
allows us to overflow the stack and

154
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:59,880
control return address so the form was

155
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,550
actually in a specific part of RS links

156
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,949
in the connection path parsing function

157
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,630
and it's triggered by an extra long

158
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:10,800
connection path so you just sended this

159
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:13,110
big big packet of data and the affected

160
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,780
function in the engine dll library

161
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,850
parses that connection path to extract

162
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,869
the port and stores it into a buffer on

163
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:24,660
the stack you can specify up to 100 to

164
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:27,090
256 bytes of that connection path and

165
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,949
the buffer starts at about 200 bytes

166
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,650
above the return address so you have

167
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:37,020
control of return and this this Park is

168
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:38,489
in the in our repository as well okay

169
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,409
hopefully that wasn't too bad right now

170
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,660
let's look at the fun part the

171
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,520
application of those vulnerabilities

172
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:48,419
these are all ICS vulnerabilities in

173
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,880
attacking our nuclear power plant okay

174
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,700
so step one I'm gonna turn you guys all

175
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,530
into nuclear physicists in one minute

176
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,500
you ready

177
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:01,340
alright so nuclear fission is a process

178
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,870
where a large nucleus splits into

179
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:07,440
smaller nuclei with the release of

180
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:09,930
energy so uranium-235 splits into

181
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,660
Krypton and barium and when it does that

182
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,669
it releases 3 more neutrons each of

183
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,680
those neutrons can start another chain

184
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:21,599
another fission reaction so uranium-235

185
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,139
is the really nice isotope of uranium

186
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,270
and 238 is the naturally naturally

187
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,190
occurring one so when you when people

188
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,530
talk about enriching uranium they're

189
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:35,338
talking about putting more of the 235

190
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:37,049
into the fuel so nuclear fuel is usually

191
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,560
about 10 percent or so and weapons-grade

192
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:42,449
up to like 90 percent of uranium-235 and

193
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,098
remember those neutrons that are

194
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,800
produced those are key for understanding

195
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:52,170
the reaction and for understanding how

196
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,979
the reaction is controlled so we know

197
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,670
that the fish

198
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:59,149
reaction creates heat heat is used in

199
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,949
these reactors to make water boil and

200
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:04,680
creates steam and then the steam turns a

201
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:07,490
turbine to make power so that's it one

202
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,569
minute you guys experts and get it I

203
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,199
don't know why there's even nuclear

204
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,579
engineering you can just google it all

205
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:16,979
right so now let's name the key players

206
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:18,959
inside of the nuclear reactor number one

207
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,149
is the fuel that's the uranium it

208
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,819
releases the heat it's the key element

209
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:27,209
of fission number two is the moderator

210
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,220
this player is the guy that slows down

211
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:32,339
the fission reaction by absorbing those

212
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,920
neutrons every single Neutron that it

213
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,740
blocks stops one other fuel nucleus from

214
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,260
splitting number three player is the

215
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,149
coolant so this guy takes heat away from

216
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,730
the core and the heat is the energy and

217
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:47,339
in the fourth and more most important is

218
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,589
the control element those are like the

219
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:52,560
referees there's usually two of them and

220
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:55,459
when it starts to get too crazy inside

221
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,239
of the reactor the referee comes in and

222
00:09:55,459 --> 00:10:02,518
steps in to stop the reaction so cadmium

223
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,130
hafnium boron all of those elements

224
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,290
absorb neutrons every single Neutron

225
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,910
they absorb them and so they have the

226
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:13,560
power to completely shut down the

227
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:15,360
fission reaction okay so let's talk

228
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,459
about some different reactor designs I'm

229
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,220
going to describe five different reactor

230
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:22,829
designs and each of which is more

231
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,899
vulnerable than the last so first off

232
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:27,510
and by far the most prevalent is the

233
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,120
pressurized water reactor there's about

234
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,310
300 of them in the world and they're

235
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,540
more more more and more of them go into

236
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,339
production as time goes on because

237
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,920
they're extremely stable they have

238
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:40,889
negative reactivity coefficients which

239
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,579
means that as the temperature of the

240
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:46,170
elements in the reactor goes up the

241
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:48,899
diffusion of reactivity goes down so

242
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:52,290
they're very stable boiling water

243
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,120
reactors is like the little sister of

244
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,620
the pressurized water reactor they're

245
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,110
the same the only difference is that

246
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,149
there's no separate heat exchanger the

247
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,310
heat exchanging all happens inside of

248
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:04,019
the core so steam is actually produced

249
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,390
directly in the core with the fuel

250
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:09,750
elements and one of the larger B

251
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:12,300
urs is the kashi was a key carrier in

252
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,890
japan which was constructed by Hitachi

253
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:20,160
and General Electric and this is the

254
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:23,970
control diagram from the NRC for that

255
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,449
for that BWR in Japan the control

256
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,910
systems all of the instrumentation all

257
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:32,279
of the safety systems are all on the

258
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,469
same network but don't worry guys it's

259
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,430
air gapped

260
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,079
you can see the fully

261
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,719
computer-controlled separate response

262
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,209
systems so the redundant safety systems

263
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,829
are the emergency core cooling system

264
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:47,849
and that's on the lower left where it

265
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:51,000
says ECC s it sprays boric acid into the

266
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:53,399
reactor in order to kill fission the

267
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,320
second one is the scram which is control

268
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,170
rod insertion that's to the right of the

269
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:03,089
ECC s and it drops the control rods into

270
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:05,399
the core to stop fission okay fourth one

271
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,380
Canada came up with their own modified

272
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,839
design of the pressurized water reactor

273
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,630
called the can-do and it it's a

274
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,339
pressurized heavy water reactor it uses

275
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,260
heavy water as a moderator instead of

276
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,690
light water deuterium which is a

277
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,029
hydrogen hydrogen isotope and deuterium

278
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:24,089
already has the extra Neutron that light

279
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:26,370
water doesn't have so it's absorbing

280
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:28,560
less neutrons which makes it able to

281
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,560
sustain the chain reaction more

282
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,380
efficiently and in in response as a

283
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,239
result of that you can use less enriched

284
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,029
fuel so a lot of times they'll use raw

285
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,850
uranium or very low enriched uranium to

286
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:44,339
fuel the reactor so it costs less but

287
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,829
the reduction in fuel costs comes with a

288
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:48,990
safety cost the fission core is designed

289
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:51,930
with a positive void and fuel

290
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:54,000
coefficients meaning as steam increases

291
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:58,140
inside of the core reactivity of the

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,290
reactor goes up which results in a it's

293
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,810
just unstable operation of it so it

294
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,430
could it creates a situation where

295
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:08,719
fission reaction can run with a

296
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,719
disastrous consequence

297
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,920
all right so forth the can do let's talk

298
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,149
about some safety systems in there this

299
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,520
is for the pressurized heavy water

300
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:19,830
reactor and pick the Canadian one this

301
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,350
is this schematic the

302
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,120
Canadian reactor in Darlington this

303
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,120
informations from the u.s. NRC the

304
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,970
Nuclear Regulatory Commission the office

305
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,520
of regular regulatory research publishes

306
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,620
all of their research and reference

307
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,900
material at NRC gov this is where I got

308
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,720
that so the Canadian system relies on

309
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,730
computer control through two redundant

310
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,820
computers that manage information and

311
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,040
alarms they're aware of how unstable the

312
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,800
reactor design is so they implement

313
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,560
these safety systems with specific

314
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,479
diversification requirements there's two

315
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,449
critical safety systems right sts-1 and

316
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,040
sts-2 the absorption rods which drop

317
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,620
into the core and then the boric acid

318
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,569
injection which which injects boron in

319
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,060
absorbing all the neutrons in killing

320
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:08,490
fission so the two safety systems are

321
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,339
required to use different operating

322
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,110
systems one has to be on Windows one has

323
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,360
to be on Linux they use different

324
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,070
architectures one has to be with an

325
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,640
Intel chip the other one has to use AMD

326
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:22,650
one they also have to have different

327
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,420
software languages so one one of the

328
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,189
code even if the logic is exactly the

329
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,839
same one has to be written in Fortran

330
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,620
and the other has to be written in C or

331
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,270
something even so far as to being

332
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,790
developed and coded they have to be run

333
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,980
by separate teams so if you wrote code

334
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:41,310
for SDS one you can't write it for SDS

335
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:45,570
two if you operate SDS one you can't

336
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:48,839
operate on the second safety system so

337
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:51,870
the result of this is just that you need

338
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,250
a couple more zero days but no big deal

339
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:58,050
guys you can just borrow some of ours

340
00:14:53,250 --> 00:15:00,930
from earlier all right last reactor type

341
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:03,209
the AGR advanced the gas reactor it's a

342
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,699
gas moderated reactor that's used in the

343
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,620
UK and they looked at the problem of

344
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,470
void coefficients inside of the reactor

345
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,730
where the coolant can boil causing an

346
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,500
increase in reactivity like what do we

347
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,330
do about that and they just took it out

348
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,790
of the equation so they use gas to cool

349
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:19,790
the reactor and so you don't need to

350
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,319
consider state changes of the coolant as

351
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:28,709
it doesn't come into play for design

352
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:30,780
considerations so the very very last and

353
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,820
best reactor of all is the infamous

354
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,959
Russian reactor the one that would use

355
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,480
in Chernobyl

356
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,970
it's extremely unstable because as

357
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,940
liquid boils in the core reactivity

358
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:44,010
increases and it causes a positive

359
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,690
feedback loop so in general

360
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,939
Russia has been phasing these out like

361
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:53,010
there they took decommission am I crazy

362
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:56,250
there's only a few of them left so now

363
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,420
our attack scenario so our network it

364
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,270
will always be air gapped as a

365
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,189
precaution but so we need to start with

366
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,930
an initial infection to get into the

367
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,970
adjacent Network and it's easy to do

368
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,410
with some fishing or just consumer

369
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,170
grading our targeting an employee

370
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,150
corporate network now once we're into

371
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,709
the adjacent Network some human

372
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,900
interaction or other propagation

373
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,520
zero-day will require it will be

374
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,829
required allowing us to get into the

375
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,710
control network we've seen examples of

376
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:25,050
this before with Stuxnet as an example

377
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:28,520
use a Windows vulnerability over USB and

378
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,229
a man on the inside to jump the gap and

379
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,390
once you're in the network running on an

380
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,220
operator panel one of the or one of the

381
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,910
peripheral systems the next step is to

382
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,230
get on to one of the controllers to get

383
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,819
on to one of the controllers we can use

384
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,940
another vulnerability for example the

385
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,110
Siemens authentication bypass to spread

386
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,490
to the controller inside of the

387
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,870
production network and that was the

388
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,200
first vulnerability that I described

389
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,850
here after the infection phase of the

390
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,280
attack is over we need to start

391
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,020
modifying control systems modifying PLC

392
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,579
logic in production systems can actually

393
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,240
be accomplished in a couple different

394
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:04,860
ways and so one of the recent examples

395
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,500
was at blackhat the University of Tel

396
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:10,469
Aviv they discussed some vulnerabilities

397
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,569
into somatic PLC's to do this another

398
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,280
way is the malware implant could just

399
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:17,030
wrap the communications module on the

400
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,520
controller modifying traffic in and out

401
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:23,099
to do automatic function changes and

402
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,569
signals going in and out and then for

403
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:27,270
our attack on the power plant we need to

404
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:29,159
be able to stop the coolant pumps from

405
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,230
pre but from providing coolant to the

406
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,950
reactor core and then we need to also be

407
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,760
able to withdraw the control rods to

408
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:40,500
increase the power of the fission

409
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,990
reaction beyond criticality the third

410
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,110
and integral part of the attack is

411
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,580
delaying response by operators on the

412
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,169
plant by

413
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,090
providing false telemetry and the

414
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,610
illusion of control to the plant

415
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,649
operators so simulated logic can be

416
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:58,560
implanted into the controller to send

417
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,270
calculated temperatures pressure power

418
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,490
readings all up to the operator

419
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,470
interface so as the plant operator

420
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,600
attempts to move control rods to slow

421
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,880
the fission reaction the implant the

422
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,379
implant sends back simulated signals to

423
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,180
give the operator a delusion that the

424
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,230
reactor core is operating under stable

425
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:20,010
conditions and then the last part of the

426
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:22,650
attack is to disable the critical and

427
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,270
redundant manual and automatic safety

428
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,430
measures so those are those safety

429
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,100
systems that we looked at in the can-do

430
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,170
schematic and the attacking malware can

431
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,659
replace the logic in the emergency core

432
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,950
cooling system and in the scram control

433
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,170
rod insertion such that they'll not

434
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,540
trigger from automatic or operator

435
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,360
manual controls and this allows the core

436
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,820
time to heat beyond design limits and

437
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,729
start either a meltdown process or some

438
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,470
internal steam explosion to where

439
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:56,070
conditions go beyond the design

440
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:58,800
specifications so the tax scenario for

441
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,169
the Russian RBMK reactors they're very

442
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,690
unstable and still in use in some places

443
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,220
in Russia and they rely entirely on

444
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,220
those logical control systems to

445
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,230
maintain stability if an attacker we're

446
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,760
able to achieve control of safety over

447
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,650
control systems they could easily cause

448
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,890
a catastrophic explosion within an hour

449
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,990
it happens really quickly the

450
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,670
pressurized heavy water reactor use in

451
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,920
Canada and India they're more stable

452
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:25,050
than RBMK s but less stable than the

453
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,000
light water reactors used in the US so

454
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,800
because they use an enriched uranium

455
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,930
fuel their fission reactivity actually

456
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,600
increases as the fuel temperature goes

457
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,460
up and they also allow an attacker to

458
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,830
create a condition that would be beyond

459
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,990
the design spec for the core and a

460
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,909
possible runaway fission reaction for

461
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:46,200
the worst case scenario of a core

462
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:49,590
thermal explosion now all power plants

463
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,510
in many countries including the u.s. use

464
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,760
don't use those designs but they'll use

465
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,640
these light water reactors the PWRs in

466
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,280
the BW RS this was the kind of reactor

467
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,790
that Fukushima was for example in Three

468
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,680
Mile Island was the B tub

469
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,570
so these type of reactors are designed

470
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,100
to make it impossible to create any

471
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,950
circumstance where there's a runaway

472
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:12,280
fission reaction but there's there's

473
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,960
always still the case of the core

474
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,430
melting down so an attacker would be

475
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,030
able to cause this over a longer period

476
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,430
of time

477
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:21,310
by removing colon flow coolant flow from

478
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:24,370
the reactor so as the reactor byproducts

479
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:26,260
decay there's still adding heat to the

480
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,449
reactor core which eventually as it

481
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,920
keeps heating up would eventually melt

482
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:37,180
the fuel rods and then would eventually

483
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:38,800
melt the surrounding enclosures so I

484
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:42,370
just wanted to end the presentation on

485
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,139
some final thoughts that you know like

486
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,449
we're spreading some kind of fear and

487
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,750
uncertainty here but just that nuclear

488
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,670
power in general is very good it's you

489
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,770
know well let me say that you know in

490
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,390
order to pursue an attack vector I'm

491
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:59,410
pulling out all the vulnerabilities of a

492
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:02,590
system looking at the weaknesses so you

493
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:05,080
know it's typical of a technology by

494
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,699
this name to evoke fear because it has

495
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,639
nuclear in there to both fear and

496
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:13,090
uncertainty so it's a very heavily

497
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:16,480
regulated industry because of those

498
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:19,330
reasons and so it's has an increased

499
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,240
safety you know compared to other other

500
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,580
power industries so in the u.s. you know

501
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,800
also we get more than 20% of our power

502
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:31,120
from nuclear and there's never really

503
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,770
been a bad incident and on the other

504
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,169
hand you know one other thing to note is

505
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,030
that this type of attack could really be

506
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,100
applied to any industry doesn't have to

507
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:41,320
be an attack on nuclear so these

508
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,000
scattered devices and the ICS devices

509
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,899
how easy these vulnerabilities are to

510
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,300
find you know makes makes you have to

511
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:53,200
consider more avidly the OT and ICS

512
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:55,330
environments so that's it and we have

513
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,760
our proof of concept repository on

514
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,840
github that has all of those it has

515
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,090
exploits for all those 12

516
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,419
vulnerabilities and if you have any

517
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:08,250
questions yes you can I'm available on

518
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,310
Twitter and thank you guys for coming

519
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,310
you
