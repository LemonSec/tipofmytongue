1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
adjustments on it and it was crazy I was

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,849
like all for a hat

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:12,599
well fur hat yes it is worth it

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:15,330
so okay alright so I'm just gonna get

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,670
started I have 25 minutes to bring this

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,830
home so I want to pack in as much

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,519
information as I possibly can

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:27,650
I have Tom over here as my helper he's

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,900
my threat actor yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk so

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,910
and he has some special things that I

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,480
made specifically for the audience

12
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,790
I ordered custom fortune cookies with a

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,190
custom message in it so be sure to get

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,239
one before you leave and he'll be

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:51,539
handing them out throughout the

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:54,059
presentation so I get into the office

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,760
early in the morning right and what do I

18
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,289
do I check my email and I see what the

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,339
different threats sharing groups are

20
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,290
doing so I'm like reading through and

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,330
there's like a ton emails right and

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,420
they're all talking about this one

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:13,320
specific spearfishing campaign so I'm

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,290
like alright I guess I'll see if it's in

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,689
my environment so I get the domain I do

26
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,119
some hunting you know I do this Blanc

27
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,350
thing and I do some searching and I'm

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,020
like oh crap

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,479
like it looks like we got the same exact

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,390
spearfishing campaign that the threat

31
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,360
Intel groups are talking about so what

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,390
do I do I take a look at that particular

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,229
domain and just FYI don't try this at

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,950
home or at work

35
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,890
OPSEC bla bla bla all of that so I find

36
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,840
out that the domain is from China and

37
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,920
I'm trying to figure out what the heck

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,100
is going on so of course it's gotta be

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,670
the Chinese attacking our company is

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,469
China right so then I'm like well you

41
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,270
know I'll take a look at the domain see

42
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,579
what's going on with it like what the

43
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,670
heck are they trying to do or get my

44
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,489
particular users to do and I see here

45
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,849
that it's just some random thing doesn't

46
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,870
look anything too fancy but there are

47
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,500
Chinese character

48
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:20,670
so of course I'm like it's China China's

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:24,930
definitely attacking us but as any good

50
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:28,109
CTI analyst knows there are threat actor

51
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,230
reports and I wouldn't be doing a good

52
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,660
job if I didn't at least look at those

53
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:36,560
so I do some googling and I do some

54
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:42,150
searching and I go to the vendors and

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:46,140
I'm like oh Russians use spearfishing

56
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,989
what so I look into the different TTP's

57
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,929
associated with that and it's like

58
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:54,180
spearfishing waterhole attacks oh and

59
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,250
guess what that's what we've got with

60
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,879
the particular domain and campaign that

61
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,510
was sent to us so you know I changed my

62
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,640
mind

63
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,120
I'm like it's not China China's not

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,730
attacking us it's Russia Mother Russia

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,090
with love from Russia they're sending us

66
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,849
malicious evil badness so of course what

67
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,859
comes to mind when you think of Russia

68
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:21,209
I'll give you two guesses has to do with

69
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:24,060
the title it must be fancy bear a PT 28

70
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,420
they're attacking our organization we

71
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,849
just it has to be them it must be fancy

72
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,700
bear right so then I look at the

73
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:34,649
particular things that are associated

74
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,399
with that particular threat actor that

75
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:41,209
they're publicly available known and to

76
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,280
do so do we have credential harvesting

77
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,530
let's see that doesn't look too much

78
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,180
like credential harvesting to me I don't

79
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,639
know about you guys but to me I'm gonna

80
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:58,739
say nope is there a spoofed email login

81
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:00,989
page I don't know that that doesn't

82
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,329
really look like a spoofed email login

83
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,519
page so I'm gonna say no and we have a

84
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:09,650
little visitor over here we have Putin

85
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,650
he says he says hey

86
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:21,030
so am i a u.s. political organization uh

87
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:23,940
last I checked I'm gonna say no so hmm

88
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,770
this makes me think well we don't have a

89
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:30,090
lot of the things that are associated

90
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:33,380
with abt 28 so maybe it's not fancy

91
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:37,169
there maybe so I looked at other

92
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,430
bear-type productors so it must be

93
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,969
venomous fair

94
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,729
what about venomous fair right so we got

95
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,410
we got spearfishing that's a definite

96
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:52,500
yes

97
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:55,860
is there spoofed infrastructure well I

98
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,200
could say yes for that am i a government

99
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,169
organization or a non-government

100
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,050
organization yeah I fall into pretty

101
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,060
much any organization so I'm gonna say

102
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,320
yes

103
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,940
Russian holidays I looked at the

104
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,490
different campaigns and information

105
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,030
associated with it and guess what

106
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:18,479
around Russian holidays I saw no

107
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:20,250
activity whatsoever so I'm gonna say yes

108
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,400
there was no activity during Russian

109
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,110
holidays Russian normal business hours

110
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,310
was there activity

111
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:33,510
see we have Putin there he says hey and

112
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:36,750
yes there was so guess what it's gotta

113
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:40,229
be Russia it's fresh ah but then I'm

114
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,000
like well that's that's a pretty

115
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:43,409
far-fetched thing I don't know if I want

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,510
to go in front of my seesaw and be like

117
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,080
Russia's attacking us

118
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,570
so what else can I look into right so I

119
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,099
didn't take into consideration malware

120
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,639
so I'm gonna look at that right

121
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,669
we had a malware sample that did end up

122
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,979
on a targeted users end point and after

123
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:04,469
our D 4 team looked at it and did all

124
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,510
their fancy deeper stuff we found out

125
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:10,560
that it was dark comet

126
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:13,110
dart comet so I'm gonna reference thread

127
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,790
actor reports again just because there's

128
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,320
a lot of really smart people out there

129
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,530
that put out a lot of really great

130
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,210
intelligence so after some googling and

131
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:27,229
some searching and looking up under

132
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:33,419
stuff I'm like oh it must be a PT 38

133
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:35,880
which is drumroll North Korea and if you

134
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,550
look in the back we have a friend from

135
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,659
North Korea visiting us just today for

136
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,580
this talk and they're totally not a

137
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,100
nuclear threat he's totally here

138
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,849
friendly not trying to like you know do

139
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:55,820
anything bad or evil he's a good guy so

140
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:58,830
am i financial institution yes

141
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,440
are there any attacks related to Apache

142
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,210
struts well I started doing some

143
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,060
searching and looking at the latest

144
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,890
exploits and old exploits for Apache

145
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,170
struts seeing what Apache struts

146
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,150
versions we had in our environment

147
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,830
double-checking some like you know

148
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,599
random dude didn't decide to like

149
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,450
install some other random stuff that's

150
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,730
related to Apache and during the time of

151
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,130
all this stuff and nope

152
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:27,330
we have no attacks related to Apache

153
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:33,030
struts so are there other signs of TTP's

154
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:35,849
related to apt 38 no so what do you do

155
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,119
as a CGI analyst right you're like crap

156
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:42,320
it's not apt 38 it's like the end of the

157
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,930
world right but even though it's not

158
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,900
probably apt 38 it could still be Korea

159
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,350
and mind you apt 38 based upon the

160
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,270
published publicly available information

161
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,310
so they could have changed TTP's we

162
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,500
don't know we still have no idea it

163
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,440
could be Korea it could be United States

164
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,120
it could be a 16 year old you know in

165
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,640
their basement it could be pretty much

166
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:12,110
anyone anywhere any time any place

167
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:12,110
so where else is Dart comment found

168
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:18,878
it's actually for free you can get it

169
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,930
for free if you want something called

170
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,240
commodity malware so back in 2008 a

171
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,780
French professional really fancy name

172
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,639
that I can't say there was over 70,000

173
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,508
downloads of dart comment and you can

174
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,330
get it for free

175
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:36,370
so basically I could send dirt comment

176
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,589
to whoever I want you could send dart

177
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:42,070
comment anyone could send dirt comment

178
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:44,770
if they really wanted to so as a CTI

179
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,020
analyst I do a lots and lots more

180
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,390
research

181
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:53,860
lots and lots Dave would not his head to

182
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:57,040
this one and as I go through it I'm like

183
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,680
gosh you know attribution is a continual

184
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,990
process it's something that you do over

185
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,660
time and changes continually based upon

186
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,510
the campaign's information stuff that's

187
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,000
published like it's it's not static you

188
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,970
can't be like oh it's it's it's it must

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,630
be fancy bare right but information

190
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:19,120
changes all the time and TTP's and just

191
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,240
all of that like it's it's it's a

192
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,790
process it's not something that just

193
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,790
happens overnight

194
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:30,099
but basically despite all of this and

195
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,260
despite all the things that thread

196
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:38,410
actors can do it boils down to one thing

197
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:41,430
and that's human operators like Tom our

198
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,430
threat actor

199
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:48,579
so hey y'all I am Xena or cheerio on the

200
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:52,180
Twitter's I'm a CT eye analyst for a

201
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:54,489
fortune 500 financial services company

202
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:58,269
I'm a doctorate student at Marymount

203
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:00,339
University and I have 6 GX certs

204
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:04,779
a bunch of other stuff you can read my

205
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:07,300
bio and I'm not speaking on behalf of my

206
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:10,410
employers I have more than one so not

207
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,870
speaking on behalf of any of them and

208
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:17,199
this is illustrative it does not mean to

209
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:20,800
reflect the true trade craft attribution

210
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:23,529
it's very hard I am NOT an attribution

211
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,300
professional this talk is basically why

212
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:30,699
I don't do actual true attribution and

213
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:34,029
yeah so basically entertainment nod and

214
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:37,689
smile laugh take pictures like a tourist

215
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:43,000
you know yeah attributions hard I don't

216
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:44,800
do it disclosure so here's a brief list

217
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,850
of stuff that I'm gonna talk about in

218
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:54,639
the next 15 minutes attribution is hard

219
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,899
it's not for the faint of heart and I

220
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:01,870
thought you'd like the picture because

221
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:04,240
it says bourbon bitches so and just like

222
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,189
fsd I don't know if you're familiar with

223
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,689
them fuzzy snuggly duck it's a bunch of

224
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:11,259
different professionals within the

225
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:12,910
industry CTI analysts we all do CTI

226
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:15,819
differently and we all different

227
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,560
perspectives and we all you know build

228
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:20,259
each other up and help us become better

229
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,359
professionals there's no right way to do

230
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:25,449
attribution there's no right way to do

231
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,209
CT I I'm not telling you you have to do

232
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:33,008
it this way it's just ideas and

233
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:37,268
information that I'm sharing period so

234
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:39,009
what is attribution what does it mean so

235
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:43,149
I'm gonna read a definition for you guys

236
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:45,939
it's ascertaining responsibility for

237
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:48,160
malicious cyber activity and this is

238
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:50,949
according to the humor Institution on

239
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,270
war revolution and peace and it's an

240
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:56,699
American public policy think-tank

241
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,819
research institution located at Stanford

242
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,340
University in California so basically it

243
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,470
requires a lot of different toolsets

244
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:06,810
staffing you need to have a diverse set

245
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,450
of skills for the particular analysts

246
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,819
that you have you need to get priorities

247
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,200
from the upper upper upper people like

248
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,560
what do they want you spending their

249
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,550
time on what are they responsible for

250
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,400
management I mean there's so much

251
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:22,469
involved with potentially tackling true

252
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,910
attribution or just attribution in

253
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:29,700
general so no presentation would be

254
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,680
complete without its CODIS I love him

255
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,820
and this is when he gave away the PI's

256
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,579
so Jason D jolly PhD he wrote a book

257
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,070
called attribution state responsibility

258
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,910
and the duty to prevent malicious

259
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:46,650
cyberattacks and international law so in

260
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,890
that particular book he breaks down

261
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:51,090
attribution and to three different

262
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,819
sectors and then gives specific

263
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:55,740
techniques under each particular segment

264
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,190
so the first one is technical

265
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,440
attribution the next one is forensic

266
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:05,210
attribution and the third one is inter

267
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,400
indirect attribution with an overarching

268
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:10,560
multiple attribution frameworks that

269
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,500
means using multiple techniques under

270
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,170
each particular division and coming up

271
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:20,640
with attribution so out of this really

272
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:22,709
long book that's really long I can

273
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,740
basically sum it up for one in one

274
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,770
sentence for you know single technical

275
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,280
attribution technique or scheme is able

276
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:34,770
to adequately attribute a cyberattack

277
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,990
standing alone and it's very difficult

278
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:41,010
and almost impossible to do in some

279
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:43,770
cases let's say you're gonna try to

280
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:46,439
tackle it right here's some things that

281
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,480
people and the technical side of things

282
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,080
would look at so I'm gonna read this off

283
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,240
a keyboard usage language used with the

284
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,990
particular malware like if it's Python

285
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:02,130
or C plus or even assembly the compiler

286
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:05,370
use compile time libraries metadata

287
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,560
resource language time zone info the

288
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,009
build times the C to check in

289
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,319
time's mutex names colonel pull tags

290
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:17,430
passwords indicators domain registration

291
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:24,240
IP ownership code styles P DNS SSL certs

292
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:26,069
and more it just goes on so what's the

293
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,279
difference between NATO and non-nato

294
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:32,430
countries nato has affirmed that

295
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,959
international law applies in cyberspace

296
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,709
so what does that mean

297
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,689
some allies including Denmark Estonia

298
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:42,569
Lithuania the Netherlands the United

299
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:44,819
Kingdom and the United States have

300
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:47,628
sought to use public attribution of

301
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:54,290
malicious cyber activity to change

302
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:58,170
behavior so what's in a naming structure

303
00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:01,290
just FYI there's no standard reporting

304
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,689
or naming structure just like a PT 28 or

305
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,990
fancy bearer has been called many other

306
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:09,990
different names it's like I get a

307
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,759
particular campaign right or a vendor

308
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,740
gets a particular campaign then a

309
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,050
different company gets a different

310
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,240
campaign and everyone gets like a

311
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,099
different view into the threat actors

312
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,189
and what they're doing not everyone has

313
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,550
like the complete total and whole

314
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:28,680
picture so of course you know if I name

315
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,019
something like orange sunrise or

316
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:35,758
starving kitten or god knows what right

317
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:38,519
like you know another organization like

318
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,170
Bank of America they'd be like girl I'm

319
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,550
not gonna name this starving kitten who

320
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,959
knows what the hell you did with your

321
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:48,359
research so that's that's kind of what

322
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:51,420
plays into it and not everyone has fire

323
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,670
I not everyone has CrowdStrike not

324
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,920
everyone has all the different Intel

325
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,500
vendors that are out there so of course

326
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,809
they get access to different information

327
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,639
you can't expect them to all be talking

328
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:04,379
about a reporting stuff that they don't

329
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:10,110
even have or that's not even available

330
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:13,460
or shared so then resources CTI analysts

331
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:17,600
don't just pop out of Milkshakes like

332
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:21,350
we uh it actually takes some education

333
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,470
and learning there's a course the skills

334
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:27,790
gap and skill shortage so you have to

335
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,470
make sure that you actually have the

336
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,180
infrastructure within your own

337
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,820
organization to support the the

338
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:37,819
difficult task of doing true attribution

339
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:40,399
or attribution in general and of course

340
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,540
no talk would be complete with a talk

341
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,610
about tradecraft

342
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:49,670
so that's cultures politics language

343
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,980
regional customs international trade

344
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,569
agreements current events around the

345
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:58,010
world just to name a few

346
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:01,420
I mean trade craft is huge immense like

347
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:04,160
it and everyone does it differently so

348
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:07,609
another thing about attribution is that

349
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,760
attackers can cover their tracks so how

350
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:13,458
do you decipher between an attacker from

351
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,699
the United States using Russian malware

352
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,720
versus a Russian from Russia using

353
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:21,860
Russian malware

354
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:25,939
I can't maybe some of you guys can but I

355
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:28,010
definitely cannot and then what we've

356
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:29,960
seen is that actors are increasingly

357
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:33,020
relying on living off the land

358
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,809
techniques and commodity malware in

359
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:40,309
order to disguise their true identity

360
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:43,639
and also to attackers like to use other

361
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:45,139
people's computers not their own so you

362
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,120
know they're using other companies

363
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,150
infrastructure to launch these attacks

364
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,559
so you're like oh it's the small dental

365
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:57,860
practice and you're like okay maybe not

366
00:17:53,559 --> 00:18:01,670
bad idea and then also to thread actors

367
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,770
tend to it's like you think a thread

368
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,740
actor once they gain access they're like

369
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:10,100
oh it's all mine no like they tend to

370
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:13,490
sell their access so that's also

371
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:17,679
something to consider and in cyber

372
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:20,260
mercenaries the state hackers and power

373
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,080
Tim Mauer discusses the use of

374
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,950
independent hackers to act as a proxy

375
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,260
for nation-state actors so I don't know

376
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,640
about you guys once again but I wouldn't

377
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:34,090
be able to tell the difference between

378
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,730
an independent act hacker acting as a

379
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,669
proxy versus the actual source of the

380
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:42,160
attacks and then of course we have

381
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,750
Olympic Destroyer false flag operations

382
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,690
they could purposefully be deceitful

383
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:50,100
regarding compile time compiled language

384
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:53,050
keyboard like all that stuff right so

385
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:57,550
why do we love attribution in the news

386
00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:01,000
we hear about China hackers 57 billion

387
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:04,090
dollars per year in losses due to China

388
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,750
stealing our shit so of course we're

389
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:09,610
like oh my god right and then another

390
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,370
one from the Washington Post

391
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,649
hacking keeps us up at night and it's

392
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:17,739
basically China hacking into companies

393
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:20,080
stealing or shit once again there's

394
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,510
another story from the NY Times on

395
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,179
Chinese spies who doesn't love a spy

396
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,730
story right you're like reading it like

397
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,800
oh yeah China's got the NSA hacking

398
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,200
tools and they're using them against

399
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,629
companies oh my gosh you know so of

400
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,310
course it's really interesting and then

401
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:41,080
the other thing that attribution plays

402
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:44,110
to is the storytelling aspect of it so I

403
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,620
have a couple years of actual

404
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,919
professional paid training on some of

405
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:53,080
this stuff and for instance cortisol

406
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:56,110
cortisol for your neuro chemistry gets

407
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,600
your attention creates the tension all

408
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,780
of that and then as a story progresses

409
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,149
you release dopamine which encourages

410
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:07,990
further engagement and then finally

411
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:09,820
oxytocin helps to create and solidify

412
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,730
that emotional connection with the story

413
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,939
so that it's meaningful to you so what

414
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,410
does that mean so it plays two

415
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,500
archetypes the hero's journey

416
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:24,220
you know innocent company X and strong

417
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,860
brave CGI analysts like me it's trying

418
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,530
to hunt down the threat actor you know

419
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:32,020
and it's like Oh will she find it

420
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:33,760
I don't know you know and the story just

421
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,340
progresses so of course that's more

422
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,960
memorable if I did the story at the

423
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,629
beginning that I was like yo

424
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,600
there was a spear phishing campaign and

425
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,370
it dropped out comment you'd be like and

426
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,189
like that's boring great I don't

427
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,540
remember that whatever so telling a

428
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,930
whole story is a little bit more

429
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:55,470
memorable we also have traditional

430
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:58,450
intelligence so military officers and

431
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,130
the traditional intelligence community

432
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,830
influencing cyber threat intelligence

433
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,350
and attribution but I don't know about

434
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,560
you I don't have any air strikes that I

435
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:11,949
can call inner cruise missiles so I mean

436
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,240
you might have it but I don't and then

437
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,570
some of the good things so true

438
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,180
attribution Robert Emily he says of the

439
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:22,139
forensics 578 we also have the other

440
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:25,300
instructor in here whoo I love you okay

441
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,610
he said most technical folks shouldn't

442
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,280
consider true attribution and it's

443
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,439
highly highly abused and resource

444
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:36,820
intensive with little value in the wider

445
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,950
community today so I use attribution

446
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,929
it's very helpful for some of the

447
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,210
strategic threat until folks were there

448
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,220
where they kind of look ahead at the

449
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,890
changing TTP's of some of the threat

450
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,460
actors and try to proactively like

451
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,500
protect the company right and private

452
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,240
organization versus government versus

453
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,250
critical infrastructure as a private

454
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,200
organization it's a little bit different

455
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:04,360
than let's say like you know gas or

456
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,850
electricity right you might kind of want

457
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,490
to know if China's trying to cut off all

458
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,310
our electricity or even an election

459
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:15,610
tampering

460
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:19,090
that's a CFP and trees for derbycon from

461
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:21,550
2018 to 2019 so what's useful I use

462
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,310
what's useful from attribution and then

463
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:28,730
I just don't use the rest that I don't

464
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:32,389
have time for resources skills all of it

465
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:35,570
Datta law I do what I can with what I

466
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:38,240
have and something to think about does

467
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:42,700
your company legally pursue hackers or

468
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,549
do you legally pursue fraudsters if not

469
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:50,750
why do you need to know

470
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:53,179
so attribution can hurt you can there's

471
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,910
of course hacking back you could think

472
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,890
that it's some bad hacker I'm gonna get

473
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,049
you right but it's really just an

474
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:02,360
innocent homeowner that had their home

475
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:04,790
Soho router compromised and they're

476
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:09,219
launching attacks from it something else

477
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:12,440
to consider is your seaso is your board

478
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,049
interested in stories about threat

479
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,440
actors or are they interested in metrics

480
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:20,840
and reports on your security posture

481
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,110
concerning threat vectors I'd probably

482
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,500
say the latter

483
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:30,379
so I've I've narrowed it down to using

484
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,380
TTP's instead of doing true attribution

485
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:37,640
because it's hard for most orgs and it's

486
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:41,090
hard for me period what I do instead of

487
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,210
true attribution incident triage lots

488
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:47,389
and lots of reports finding gaps within

489
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,520
the within the security posture vocs

490
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:53,480
exploits in the wild and much much more

491
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,879
and with cyber threat Intel you can be

492
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,520
more customer centric finding out what

493
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,450
the sock needs deeper hunt Red Team the

494
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:06,379
entire enterprise

495

look Putin's back spread hunting we can

496
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:12,020
take those TTP's that we also map back

497
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:15,139
to mitre because we have mitre in the

498
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:20,389
audience and then kick that over to

499
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:22,160
threat or the sock and help help help

500
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,460

501
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,799
those particular attack vectors right we

502
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:31,090
also have adversary simulation for

503
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,090
tenure a BT 28

504
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:38,490
