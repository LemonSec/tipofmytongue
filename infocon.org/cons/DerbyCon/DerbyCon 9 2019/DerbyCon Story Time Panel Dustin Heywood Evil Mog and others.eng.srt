30
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,298
figure we'll start off with one story

31
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,439
that I'll pass it off to render man here

32
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,700
because he's funny we'll pass it down

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,939
the table and back and we keep doing

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:37,380
this I'll pick one I don't care do you

35
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:39,869
want a mic area 4 so the first story I

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,509
tell is about MS bats first time at

37
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,270
Derby con so her first time at Derby con

38
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,560
she had no idea who anybody was and

39
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,210
she's the nice feel quiet little mouse

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,710
type that won't come up and inject

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,658
herself into conversation so she was

42
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,089
wandering around kind of idly here and

43
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,860
Dave's notices her and he's like yo

44
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,170
what's up how's it going you enjoying

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,460
Derby con wines have taken her down to

46
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,570
the vender village buys her some

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,548
lockpicks and he just threw out a

48
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,689
lockpick and she says he what the end of

49
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,770
this like hey don't you have something

50
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,648
important to do like I didn't know

51
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,139
running a conference he's like no I got

52
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,940
minions for ya exactly he says this is

53
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,869
what Derby con is this is what it's all

54
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,060
about and

55
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,010
make one person's day that's all that

56
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,269
freakin matters and that to me has

57
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:27,149
always been Derby Cana that's we've

58
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:29,549
strived to go for so it's it's

59
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,310
appropriate that log had me up here for

60
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:34,860
this because I had the opportunity to

61
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,379
pull one of the oh oh yeah

62
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,379
first pranks that actually happened at

63
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:44,099
Derby Kong yes Dave it involves you

64
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,599
pretty heavily so the very first year I

65
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,578
showed up here with a stack of about a

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,450
hundred of these tickets that I had

67
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:53,040
printed out that were man-hug tickets

68
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,060
that were designed to look exactly like

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,769
the golden tickets from Willy Wonka I

70
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,019
showed up early and I was here during

71
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,489
the trainings but what I I wanted to

72
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,989
have these all handed out and have Dave

73
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,730
actually interact with them and have

74
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:07,500
people hand them to him and get hugs cuz

75
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,790
that's kind of what Derby con was all

76
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,950
about at the time and that was the

77
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,150
largest thing was hey hug Dave that's

78
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,379
part of why you're here as I hand these

79
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,880
out though I'm not handing them out to

80
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,530
people individually because I didn't

81
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,540
really want it to be tracked back to me

82
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,500
that it was me doing it so I would hand

83
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,358
them out to people that I knew and about

84
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,359
stacks of five or ten and have them hand

85
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:34,769
them out to other people as well so Dave

86
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:36,569
wouldn't know I I hear about it you know

87
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,700
later on I at the conference I it's

88
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:42,720
probably half way through Saturday at

89
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,488
this point I'm over at the food court

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,919
that's across the way on 4th Street Live

91
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:51,269
and I overhear Aaron talking about how

92
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,220
dave has been just getting all of these

93
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,959
these people walking up to him handing

94
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,629
into these tickets and giving him hugs

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,459
and just talking about it and she's like

96
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:01,048
I had this gigantic stack of all of

97
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,180
these tickets sitting inside of my room

98
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:05,790
and so I kind of sidle up there I'm like

99
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,139
so I'm the one that did the ticket thing

100
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:13,980
can you hand those back to me so I can

101
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:16,168
hand them out again I the story that

102
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:22,048
actually doesn't end there unfortunately

103
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:24,000
or somewhat unfortunately yeah but turns

104
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:26,099
out that some of the jockeys the

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,610
security staff had grabbed some of them

106
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,340
and

107
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,090
picked up a a copier inside of the Hyatt

108
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,590
and made a bunch of counterfeit man-hug

109
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,628
tickets and we're like throwing them off

110
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,080
the stage come Saturday evening

111
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:41,939
yeah exactly making it rain man hugs a

112
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,960
poor day there's no way he didn't get

113
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:47,610
sick after that but the the worst part

114
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,590
about that to me is cuz I really wanted

115
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,740
this just just float and have nobody

116
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:55,109
know who did this but Jason Street ended

117
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,210
up actually like daxing me on Sunday

118
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,440
morning when Dave jumped up and like who

119
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,878
the hell's done this thing but that that

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,830
was the the first prank there that

121
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:12,599

122

monster and just full disclosure I am

134
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,529
not feeling well this morning but you

135
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,419
all are worth it and I got here I don't

136
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:56,900
know what happened I was just stood up

137
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:59,940
and went oh I'm not standing up anymore

138
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,310
derbycon has been incredibly

139
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,430
transformative to my life I did web

140
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,169
development and came here because it was

141
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,000
my I live here in Louisville so this is

142
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:10,650
a security conference and I'm like I

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,169
remember doing stuff like that when I

144
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,690
was young before you know I turned 18

145
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:22,529
and prison decided seemed like a bad

146
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:23,909
idea and so I came here and the the

147
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:26,460
level 1 hacker space where I volunteer

148
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:28,469
was hosting the after-party where I cook

149
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,909
dinner and I got to meet a bunch of

150
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:32,610
people and I got to learn that this was

151
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:34,440
a career that I could move towards and

152
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,770
so I got out of web development and been

153
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,300
moving more into InfoSec stuff it's

154
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,490
where I started teaching soldering

155
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,270
and and began having that impact on

156
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:51,520
people's lives it's where I met so many

157
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:54,609
incredible people and I basically you

158
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,030
know I don't know how to put this in

159
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,850
words

160
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,630
I started out sitting in the audience go

161
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,280
on Wow

162
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,650
all those people up there are so cool I

163
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,409
wish I could be like them and the people

164
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,030

195
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,880
right and now I've been up on stage

196

right now yeah man we're old yeah so I I

198
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,780
used this point in time to like look

199
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,790
back and see what I've actually

200
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,860
accomplished over those six years and

201
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,260
every year since then and it's just kind

202
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,660
of skyrocketed and this kind of started

203

205
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,310
tissues because at some point where I

206
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,840

207

00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,880
expenses grabbed a bunch of random

227
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:05,870
people and went up the 18th floor and

228
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:09,680
you know let these things go and it was

229
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,420
a case of we informed Dave and security

230
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,689
that we were doing this we weren't

231
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,860
asking permission we were just saying

232
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:20,930
when she is a fan

233
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:23,990
blame us thank you but the the best part

234
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,939
of that that I heard was some of the

235
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,650
security people on the radio when these

236
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,950
things because nobody ever looks up

237
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:32,780
there they started coming down and

238
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,900
people looking out but they're like oh

239
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:38,810
yeah clapping and apparently what over

240
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:45,860
the radio is it's raining men I repeat

241
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:47,930
it's raining man but this thing is we

242
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,220
ran down to clean up because you know

243
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,189
it's one of her rules is we clean up

244
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:55,190
after ourselves they were already gone

245
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,630
like everybody just absconded with these

246
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,800
things not that we you know said that

247
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,750
you could but it's like your dinner

248
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,699
cleaning for us so thank you thank you

249
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,680
the rule is you have to clean up it's a

250
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,580
commandment six of shenanigans or five

251
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,290
or whatever it is

252
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,579
thou shalt clean up after themselves

253
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,620
speaking of shenanigans our first

254
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,489
shenanigans ever aside from that would

255
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,110
have been the time we were doing

256
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:19,230
initiations I was at the party the one

257
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:21,160
year so I didn't realize this until you

258
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,809
afterwards but one year we were setting

259
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,790
up the Church of Wi-Fi initiations right

260
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:26,469
outside the party entrance there was a

261
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,660
line up around the block to figure out

262
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,920
you know to get it and joined the church

263
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,569
and I'm like what the heck is going on

264
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,459
like we're getting ties from yo

265
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:35,729
Wisconsin like cheese hats and like

266
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:38,258
hand-painted cheese shot glasses

267
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,939
something's going down apparently people

268
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,660
thought it was mandatory to get into the

269
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:47,459
party to join the church so those of you

270
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:50,319
who are unaware basically there's me and

271
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:52,800
Pope robes he's dressed as a bishop

272
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:57,699
we had a slutty nun with a

273
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,920
cat-o'-nine-tails we had altar boy in a

274
00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:05,589

277
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,300
like the rest of us is 80-proof and it's

278
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,790
usually the worst bourbon we can find at

279
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,420
CVS like I guess that's plastic his

280
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,910
bottle we could find you know the body

281
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:22,420

282
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:25,120
Ranch Doritos right are us arise and

283
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,309
receive your whipping from the nun who's

284
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,620
Stacey Stacey Stacey was that was the

285
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:31,600
nun sadly she's retired from in po sex

286
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:35,800
so I'm in the cheap replacement yeah but

287
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:39,509
no but she she does like triathlons and

288
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,490
I her man's so you know she's built and

289
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:44,199
she destroyed the cat-o'-nine-tails we

290
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,319
bought her at the shop down the road in

291
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:50,859
like five minutes and we're bars always

292
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:56,378
belts and the best part was the atrium

293
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:58,660
over the Hyatt the echo hear crack wait

294
00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:01,300
that's you all you heard all night crack

295
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:04,029
usually buy a like scream of pain but

296
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,399
like it was it was what are those like

297
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,660
the acoustics in here are great yeah and

298
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,639
that's the reason why we got the paddle

299
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,679
because my arm isn't as strong as hers

300
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,709
so I went to a custom paddle

301
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,029
manufacturer and I'm like hey I'm he's

302
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,219
banging for two pound hackers I did this

303
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,590
thing not to break on them so

304
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,330
they may be a custom 24 inch long six

305
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,360
inch wide one inch thick solid maple

306
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,860
paddle and this paddle is gonna be the

307
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,960
prize for Derby mud it's signed by every

308
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,980
but it's been smacked by it this year so

309
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,210
if you want to join you get a sticker

310
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,560
you get smacked but you have to give

311
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:38,860
consent before you smacked by it and I

312
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:46,180
wind up I apologize favorite moment at

313
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:49,060
Derby con start with integral so that's

314
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:57,540
that's a real problem actually because I

315
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:57,540
don't remember a lot of Derby cons yeah

316
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:05,470
I'm gonna have to pass for right this

317
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:09,670

318

319
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:16,030

320
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:22,300
you're up see I'm not the only one here

321
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:24,610

like this little memorial

347
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,990
well people started adding to it the

348
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,209
problem is

349
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:35,470
I think got torn down rather rapidly so

350
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:39,609
we waited till they closed up their

351
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:41,860
fumigated yeah so they closed we put it

352
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,130
back and it got bigger and bigger

353
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,990
there's Eddie doing custom art for this

354
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,189
thing there's there's pretty sure dave

355
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,990
was involved in some of these videos

356
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:54,690
along with some of his friends allegedly

357
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:58,000
allegedly Dave might have been involved

358
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:00,970
but it you know people are tweeting this

359
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,080
and stuff and we're we're sitting around

360
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,550

twitter yeah Trevor forget was trending

377
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,020
honestly that would have been my

378
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,459
response well it was funny because they

379
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,899
were kind of interacting with us for a

380
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:54,369
little while and then they finally just

381
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:56,589
like shut down after a while I like

382
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,600
please stop and then like he said that's

383
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:01,270
when everyone really got on and started

384
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,040
going crazy I mean there was a some

385
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,809
medical incident or something on the 4th

386
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,459
Street live just around the corner and

387
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:08,379
so there was ambulance and and fire

388
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,150
departments and police showing up so

389
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:14,439
there's pictures of like it's too late

390
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:16,089
you can't save them but the best part

391
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,250
was the cops yes

392
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:20,409
the cops who were dealing with that

393
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,290
incident you know they left they came

394
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:25,900
back just our sure curiosity of what

395
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,250
they I was going on here there's people

396
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,309
out here and for this like makes you

397
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:34,300
feel more important authorities for a

398
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:35,830
room and they're like this is this is

399
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,470
not what we're used to dealing with out

400
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,120
of here Hurley you actually like wasn't

401
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,820
there singing to at some point right

402
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:46,039
they were singing i sainted Trevor the

403
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,629
roach in full robes while we were there

404
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,000
no but the the police actually showed up

405
00:17:48,629 --> 00:17:52,469
and kind of participated as well they

406
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,120
didn't just like show up and see what

407
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,490
was going on they hung out and they

408
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,979
legitimately were chilling with us

409
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,480
watching this Roach so and they told the

410
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,340
supervisors of next shift that was

411
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,200
coming on so they came on made their

412
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,309
respects so every time the cop would

413
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,990
come through they'd all come out pay

414
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,750
their respects to Trevor and every

415
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,980
couple of minutes all here is Trevor and

416
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,980
even the homeless were joining in

417
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:19,768
I mean and for me this is kind of the

418
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,350
family thing because everybody it was

419
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:26,850
like very innocent like nobody was being

420
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:30,658
hurt well maybe Smashburger bin' only

421
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:33,689
their brand but we were having so much

422
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:36,090
fun everybody was just bandy together it

423
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,700
was it was like smart people doing dumb

424
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,559
things like it's great but I still think

425
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:44,700
the the crowning like the cherry on top

426
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:47,220
of that whole thing was a you Dave this

427
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,919
bugger a couple of weeks later on see is

428
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:55,139
on getting interviewed on CNN right

429
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,379
about like what a PT group or whatever

430
00:18:55,139 --> 00:19:00,240
that we but he slips in you know they

431
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:01,559
ask of course you say yeah so I was

432
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,750
talking with her like my late friend

433
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:07,379
Trevor over a milkshake the other week

434
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:13,500
and continues on he doesn't break and

435
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:15,269
it's like dude did you did holy shit

436
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,159
and it's like an inside joke for like a

437
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:22,850
few thousand people on CNN like dude

438
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,850
that was really

439
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:29,030
that's one of the best derbycon dog

440
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,710
whistles of all time and the best part

441
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,990
about this whole thing was Trevor had a

442
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,360
college fund his college fund for his

443
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,370
kids got donated to whatever hurricane

444
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,290
victims done in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico

445
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,729
and that went to go actually genuinely

446
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,230
helping people's lives so our little

447
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,320
prank had a positive impact on

448
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:48,380
everyone's world something like 3,500

449
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,280
bucks on a GoFundMe like it was way more

450
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,820
than that it would have hidden like a

451
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,690
hundred grand by the end of it I feel

452
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,340
like a lot of our pranks have positive I

453
00:19:55,690 --> 00:20:00,710
mean I don't intend them that way if

454
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,240
it's gonna work so you guys really like

455
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:06,920
giving money to really weird things I

456
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,540
mean the kind of stupid things we pull

457
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,360
off everything from tricycle races to

458
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,790
parachutes spanking people the paddles

459
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,810
to cockroaches I mean understands what

460
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:20,090
Dave meant when go out and participate

461
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:24,800
but we're rolling with it okay I've got

462
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:26,030
my moment now yes so back at the Hyatt

463
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,120
and I don't know if this is still

464
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,350
continuing we'll continue chess was

465
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,879
something that became a pretty big thing

466
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:36,439
because of Egypt and he just started

467
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,420
bringing chess boards and playing chess

468
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,430
with everyone till late late in the

469
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:44,110
morning I how many people here have

470
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:45,290
actually played against Egypt in chess

471
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:49,449
okay

472
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:53,780
okay how many have actually beat Egypt

473
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:55,640
awesome so uh one of the years he came

474
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,440
down here he brought all the chess stuff

475
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,870
he'd also brought his family along with

476
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,090
him and I was sitting there playing

477
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:04,280
chess and chatting with with his family

478
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,080
and everything and I'm watching him and

479
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,149
his son play and they're doing pretty

480
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,669
well and then there there comes a

481
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,650
certain point where I actually get a

482
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,840
chance to play Egypt first time I play

483
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:18,200
chess against him and I I don't play

484
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,120
chess very often so I think that led to

485
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,270
what eventually ended up happening where

486
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,850
I end up beating Egypt in chess yeah

487
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:27,950
exactly as far as I know right now I'm

488
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,659
still the only person that has at Derby

489
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:34,570
how drunk was he thank you

490
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,670
it's better right yeah I think it was

491
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,490
about 2:30 in the morning so I know it's

492
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:42,580
over it up yeah exactly I don't think

493
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,470
we'd ever stopped drinking but still but

494
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,689
my general strategy of chess is to

495
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,640
actually play for a stalemate and ended

496
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,700
up to where that failed so I don't know

497
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,770
but anyways the the fun part about that

498
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,230
is is that I I beat Egypt and then I

499
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:58,600
decide to play against his son who just

500
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,190
creams the ever living crap out of me

501
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,770
because he's one of the best chess

502
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:06,030
players I've ever seen

503
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:10,210
so another side story related to chess

504
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:12,129
my first years the security there was a

505
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,580
security guy of the Hyatt that just had

506
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:18,850
no sense of humor

507
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:21,990
if his name wasn't baubles going Bob Bob

508
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,070
didn't like us but he couldn't you know

509
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,660
kick us out or anything all that

510
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,210
I mean he's used to dealing with like

511
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,240
you know drunken idiots that don't get

512
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:34,360
into fights well you know we're on sites

513
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,150
in the lobby outside sway at the bar two

514
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,949
guys are arguing loudly about something

515
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:42,190
right and he's you kind of saddling up

516
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:47,140
okay yeah there's gonna be a thing yeah

517
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:49,300
two guys are like oh no that's what you

518
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,340
think that's what you think let's settle

519
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,389
this and they go over and they start

520
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,530
playing chess dudes like I thought they

521
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,850
were gonna beat the crap out of each

522
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:02,220
other and then they sit down and played

523
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,219
chess play what kind of people are you

524
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:12,710
we got kicked in this is the first time

525
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:14,960
ever been kicked into a bar the again

526
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,220
the Hyatt the HIV I could allow the echo

527
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,870
and everything it was past midnight and

528
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,000
they're like hey you're kind of loud can

529
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,739
you you know move over the bar was

530
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,500
already closed they're like wait you're

531
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:29,120
kicking us into the bar and this is

532
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:31,039
where I I love hackers because we are we

533
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,918
do some dumb things we have way too much

534
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,600
fun but we are generally you know and

535
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,820
Dave and your insurance company might

536
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,959
object to this that we are generally

537
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:43,340
responsible we had you know our own

538
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,720
drinks and everything with that we're

539
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,480
going began to borrow we're having

540
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,799
glasses and everything you know we're

541
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,210
ourselves you know are like are not

542
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:56,090
theirs but when we laughed we washed

543
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,590
everything and left it all you know with

544
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,270
a note saying hey we use this it's been

545
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,428
washed you know it's all good like

546
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:04,940
everybody was cleaned about this also is

547
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:06,470
great so apparently Einstein bagel

548
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,919
brothers forgot to lock their door one

549
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,899
year

550
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:13,789
allegedly and so as hackers apparently

551
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:15,649
people were nice enough to go lock pick

552
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:18,200
the doors so it got closed and locked

553
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:20,059
again until Einstein the next morning

554
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,399
hey Brett to lock your door we tweeted

555
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:23,570
that stuff out and they're like normally

556
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:25,129
a lock pick to break you into a place

557
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:29,510
not to secure it when someone forgets to

558
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:31,610
do something well that was the the other

559
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,320
fun thing about I don't know you know

560
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,320
this we tend to drink a lot at Derby

561
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,870
Kong in fact I know I know it's very

562
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,490
surprising in fact they had a really

563
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,789
hard time the first few years that we

564
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,770
were here keeping enough liquor here we

565
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:49,520
drained every hotel bar within the three

566
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:51,830
block radius derbycon one yeah it was

567
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,270
something else but the the funny thing

568
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,399
about it was the police that actually

569
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,860
show up here after hearing about how

570
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:59,840
much that we actually did drink and

571
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,969
everything they walk in expecting it to

572
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,949
be just like a bar fight constantly and

573
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,059
then they they walk in and see that

574
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,740
there's these people sitting here at

575
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:08,270
2:00 in the morning yes drinking and

576
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,590
chess is breaking out and people are

577
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,100
just kind of sitting over there on their

578
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:15,470
computers hacking something and I seen

579
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,600
cops come after their shift to come here

580
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,010
and deviants sitting there teaching them

581
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,379
how to

582
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,970
pick and shim hat they're handcuffs like

583
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,740
literally be pulling their handcuffs out

584
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:31,669
and he's showing him how to bypass so I

585
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:34,480
forget I forgot to tell my story about

586
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:38,809
when I met Dave Kennedy the first time

587
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,820
so I did not know who he was obviously

588
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:43,100
being brand new to the scene is Derby

589
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,399
con 1 this is at the level 1 afterparty

590
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,530
it's late all the foods gone so I'm

591
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,210
actually mingling with people someone

592
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:54,740
gave me my first set of lock picks there

593
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:56,510
thank you whoever that was and and I see

594
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,130
this guy and he's showing off the black

595
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,140
badge for the conference and I'm like oh

596
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,580
that's really cool and he's like yeah we

597
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,140
had you know blah blah he's talking

598
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,580
about it and I'm like I could make one

599
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,440
of those on our laser cutter in about 10

600
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,010
minutes and he turns to me he says

601
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,510
please don't

602
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:14,809
and I promised if I would never make a

603
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,910
fake black badge but I did eventually

604
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:23,809
get to make real black badges for him so

605
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:28,220
thank you very much Dave so I think it

606
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:29,629
was my second Derby con 4 where I didn't

607
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,220
realize this was a thing so I had only

608
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,520
been you know doing industry stuff for a

609
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:37,790
year and I heard people were breaking

610
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:40,850
into the elevator and like I don't even

611
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:43,040
know how you I mean that doors open I

612
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:45,070
don't know they open for you when you

613
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:52,730
push the button what else is there right

614
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:54,710
oh oh yeah yeah I'm sure so I end up

615
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,510
following a group of people that were

616
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,970
doing this and showing people how to

617
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,500
hack elevators I'm making it to the roof

618
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:08,320
of the Hyatt where you're not supposed

619
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:10,850
to be allegedly allegedly I heard and I

620
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,418
know not sure whose it is but later on

621
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:16,879
definitely wasn't mine based on size and

622
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:19,429
stuff but there was a bra hanging

623
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,169
through a great if you looked all the

624
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:24,380
way up in the atrium for the Hyatt off

625
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:27,679
of a string and it stayed there for I

626
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,510
think the entire because people thought

627
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,730
it was me and because I did the aerial

628
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,420
stuff and it's no easy were wearing a

629
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,490
bra earlier

630
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:39,710
I was wearing a bra later but that

631
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:41,720
wasn't my size okay and I think two

632
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:44,480
years two more years after that it

633
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,840
happened but yeah it was a another

634
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,060
derbycon tradition is just sneaking up

635
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,639
and finding the great and throwing a bra

636
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,440
down on a string I mean we do lots of

637
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,140
things to that other venue everything

638
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,720
from the rubber chickens that were all

639
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:02,650
over everywhere they were finally those

640
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,510
things for nine months nine months

641
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:10,220
kiddin can you have given up her ants

642
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:12,290
yeah go for rants I miss MSM huh

643
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,510
that man pulled off so many frickin

644
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,480
pranks he pulled the rubber chickens he

645
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:20,379
brought the clown noses like that man is

646
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,400
the patron saint he's dated knocks

647
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,230
patron saint of cocks at the Church of

648
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,730
Wi-Fi for that very reason we've only

649
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:30,800
seen two very few people Trevor's one of

650
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:34,040
them Barnaby Jack Rance $2 tuna and

651

grumpy cat grumpy cat and we've also

652
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,820
sainted Yolo bear after we lost we got

653
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,070
resurrected

654
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:44,629
yeah but Rance would handle these sticky

655
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,120
rubber chickens you know you put on the

656
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,320
end of your finger go shooting and I

657
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,520
would stick to the wall well people

658
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,620
weren't sticking these things to the

659
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:55,850
ceiling in the lobby the the Hyatt my

660
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,570
favorite picture of Rance is not

661
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,899
actually a Rance

662
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:05,480
it's a the Hyatt guy with the broom

663
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:09,100
trying to get his things down but but so

664
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,960
yeah I know he died January 2016

665
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:17,090
last year Banshee was standing just

666
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:21,790
inside the doors of the Hyatt and this

667
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:26,000
thing Falls is this dusty like grody

668
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:28,460
dried out chicken probably four years

669
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,560
ago just decided to fall down next to

670
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,690
her it was they are still finding

671
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,179
chickens to this day especially up on

672
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,860
the roof most of the service areas we've

673
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,090
been having this place cased over ages

674
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,469
and for those of you going now that

675
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:41,750
we're leaving this place they can't sue

676
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:44,200
us they use the age 2395 key of the

677
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,200
elevators

678
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,030
allegedly

679
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:55,760
that hotel was so cool about us doing

680
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,200
everything it they they were soon I have

681
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,490
one story but the hotel not being cool

682
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,040
than becoming cool and they realized it

683
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:06,200
was me so the same security that is

684
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,520
customary life is gone so this one

685
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,380
security guy was little bit cranky about

686
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,379
the parachuting because one year we

687
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,940
parachuted the giant moogle and he's

688
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,810
like everything else goes over top of

689
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,340
that I don't care who parachutes it it's

690
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,360
gonna be you're the one leaving I'm like

691
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,070
dude I've already submitted all the

692
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,409
paperwork I've done like three days of

693
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:26,510
math we had Chris verify it there while

694
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,980
he was sitting around like we spent

695
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,520
literally two days freaking out the

696
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,720
velocity of a monkey in a vacuum

697
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,070
yeah like would you go to the hotel

698
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,690
staff and it's like do you have a scale

699
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:40,340
in the kitchen yes can you weigh my

700
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:41,720
monkey I figure out the terminal

701
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,449
velocity of a spherical monkey in a

702
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,920
vacuum oh yeah so we show up with all

703
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,450
this engineering math the hotel manager

704
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,190
she's like yeah go for we love this tell

705
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,780
us what it is so we can watch it's

706
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,460
literally the front desk top is like we

707
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,930
can't see you from here so like tell us

708
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,520
guess we want to come out and see fish

709
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,890
so if you go on youtube search for

710
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,470
derbycon parachute you'll find all our

711
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,120
exploits on video the one thing they

712
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,020
would never allow us to do though is

713
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,449
drones

714
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:08,480
I mean we travel just here they couldn't

715
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:10,550
get a lock on the internal yeah yeah so

716
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,170
don't drone inside also if you're good

717
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,730
do it make sure you use actual properly

718
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,380
rated stuff like rocketry grade

719
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,580
parachutes and you know make sure

720
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,980
doesn't weigh more than a couple ounces

721
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,649
like literally we did the math to figure

722
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,930
out if Murdoch here broke loose and hit

723
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:26,060
somebody from 18 floors yeah there's

724
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:28,070
there wasn't enough yeah it turns out

725
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,810
the plush level is about a pound and a

726
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:31,070
half maximum fleshiness it's got to be

727
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,780
at least three feet tall for that to

728
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,780
work so that's roughly the safety now

729
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,950
what I've actually spent the engineering

730
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,020
time to do this I'm not surprised

731
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,240
hey if you wanted to do shenanigan

732
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,830
properly watch my talk from derbycon six

733
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,300
or seven how to conduct shenanigans

734
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:50,389
safely you released the tooling and

735
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,770
everything to be fair as security

736
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,310
professionals if we're good at one thing

737
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,900
it is managing risk I mean yeah

738
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:59,350
I don't know I've seen a lot of

739
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:07,240
environments I like watching it go

740
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:11,439
flying by oh it's a disturbing Conn

741
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,120
moment actually is Rance involved just

742
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,270
one of the moments sitting outside of

743
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,159
the the Hyatt middle of the night

744
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:21,340
probably like 4 a.m. and Rance strolls

745
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:26,680
up with a gigantic bottle of milk and

746
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:28,270
he's also got vodka ice and some yeah

747
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,020
Kahlua and he's just walking around

748
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:33,010
making white Russians for everybody and

749
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,840
there was something that was happening

750
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:39,430
in that particular conversation at the

751
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:41,379
time that I was already like emotionally

752
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:43,450
compromised essentially but Rance

753
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,950
walking up there and like plopping that

754
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,620
down and starting to pour me that drink

755
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:50,140
I just I absolutely lost it and started

756
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:57,159
falling because it was just it was too

757
00:32:50,140 --> 00:33:01,600
much you know yeah just sad sad

758
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:05,080
I mean I've cried I've cried it at least

759
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,120
the last two doesn't cry it derbycon

760
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,840
yeah closing is always a really tough

761
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,030
moment especially right after closing

762
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,070
closings are really good the bar bills

763
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:17,230
okay Renderman are you gonna talk about

764
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:19,600
your side I want to steal your because I

765
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:24,430
mean yours was yours was one of my top

766
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:27,459
tier diggers if you all get to issues

767
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:32,680
you want to break them out there week on

768
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:34,780
three so was my first one Dave reached

769
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,440
out to me and said you know hey you know

770
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,510
about derbycon

771
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,720
yeah I've heard the name you know

772
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:42,700
Louisville and everything you say yeah

773
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,320
you should come out you know got

774
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,940
anything to talk about like well I've

775
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,700
got this thing I've done a couple other

776
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:51,850
conferences you know I can dust off

777
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:55,240
those slides and if that talk but you

778
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:59,520
know I was vastly under employed you

779
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:02,980
know but my eyeballs and bills and such

780
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:05,970
just not in a good place mentally either

781
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,970
very depressed

782
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:12,550
and I'm like sorry I'd love to come but

783
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,669
can't afford it it's like don't worry we

784
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:20,520
got sponsor money I'll fly you fly out

785
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:25,960
to the hotel room you come speak like

786
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:26,830
okay sure free trip like of course I'll

787
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,960
do that you know

788
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:33,880
you know pilgrim a few others basically

789
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,340
decided as well they kind of looked at

790
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,399
me like dude you look like shit

791
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:45,130
you need family all your meals and

792
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:48,250
drinks piranhas playing hackers against

793
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:50,260
humanity in the lobby noise ended up

794
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,690
making a thing because we played a card

795
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:56,440
said you know missus decided this is

796
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:58,750
what is replacing AES she says I would

797
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:03,100
give $100 if anybody plays plays plain

798
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:04,960
text out of card double rot13 I played

799
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,540
it she pulls 100 bucks out of it I think

800
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,860
I've walked away from that con making a

801
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:21,130
profit actually but yeah church or Wi-Fi

802
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:25,950
I mean you know but it's what I needed

803
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:31,360
at a time I was severely depressed

804
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:33,189
probably vaguely suicidal it was so

805
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,650
refreshing to be around family and

806
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,330
people who understood it I didn't have

807
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:41,290
to say anything and they they they got

808
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:42,430
it they saw the pain Amanda

809
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:51,180
the work you're doing with mental health

810
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:51,180
village is amazing keep it up but

811
00:35:51,730 --> 00:36:01,250
I'm not sure how much Dave you knew I

812
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:05,240
was hurting at that time but you so you

813
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:07,339
know I find out later I don't think that

814
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,890
was sponsor money I think that was yours

815
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:13,900
I think he paid for that whole thing out

816
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,900
of his own pocket to get me down there

817
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:23,200
they're weak on him you know for the

818
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:23,200
next year there's a much better place

819
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,369
closing ceremonies there's there's video

820
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,609
I you know ran up during closing and

821
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:33,099
Kanye the the microphone you're good at

822
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:36,288
that

823
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:44,599
and I said it then and I'll say it again

824
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:47,420
Davey you saved my life thank you I I

825
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:49,130
don't know where the idea of I don't

826
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:53,299
know where the idea of hacker family

827
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:55,450
came from but it's this thing that the

828
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:57,890
rest of the world kind of hates us we

829
00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:01,240
need to take care of ourselves because

830
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,240
if we don't no one else will

831
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:11,119
you are some of the drunkest the

832
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:16,250
silliest foul-mouthed absolutely good

833
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:18,650
tonic a bunch of freaks but your family

834
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:21,440
you're the family I choose and I have

835
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:23,990
Eddie the yetis hacker family crest

836
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,010
tattooed on my chest over some self harm

837
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:31,250
scars I have that I was not proud of as

838
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:34,760
a reminder that you know things like

839
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:38,809
Dave doing these nice things this nice

840
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,579
thing for me saved my life so yeah hey

841
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,930
dude meeting you has been like the most

842
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:43,760
mentally beneficial things in my

843
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,970
existence I think you mean traumatizing

844
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,220
no no I mean beneficial I mean somehow I

845
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:51,109
tried to manage this guy for a number of

846
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,609
years and I used his performance reviews

847
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:55,038
and pull drag down to the bar on

848
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:56,720
Saturday nights I mean he got usually an

849
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,990
a after we have a couple of beers we're

850
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,990
good to go

851
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:06,030
it's

852
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:09,480
I go to a lot of cons but the I mean we

853
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:15,260
still talk about rants you know there's

854
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:19,980
there's I'm gonna miss Derby because

855
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:21,630
this had a vibe of family I'm still does

856
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,849
have I said it don't talk about it like

857
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,640
it's dead yet because it's not it's not

858
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:30,390
lives on our hearts

859
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:32,069
wait till it's off the slab damn it well

860
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,618
it's it's kind of similar to something

861
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:37,200
that I told MOG shortly after he'd

862
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,319
gotten is his black badge for her Derby

863
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,640
here is that and Derby is very similar

864
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,319
to this it's like just because you have

865
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,670
a black badge to Derby or to whatever

866
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:46,380
conference you happen to be at that

867
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,599
doesn't mean that like the work that you

868
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,460
were doing to actually get that badge or

869
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,250
to get the thing that got you to that

870
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,809
point is over like you still keep going

871
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:57,240
and you carry it with you and you keep

872
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:59,839
doing what you were doing and everybody

873
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,609
should do that with Derby Khan as well

874
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,900
that's part of the reason that all these

875
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:06,450
people are here we have all these people

876
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,710
here that are new this year that have

877
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,538
never come to this conference before

878
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,430
even though they know that this is the

879
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:12,599
last year that it's gonna happen I mean

880
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,640
that's crazy

881
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:16,020
well here's the thing I have a saying

882
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,640
I've been telling everybody do you hang

883
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,038
with me a Wonder beak on we're family

884
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,720
for life and I've got like little lost

885
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:23,130
up front there she song with me enough

886
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,788
times that she knows you know we're

887
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,410
family

888
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:27,299
like I look up here I see all my friends

889
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,529
it's like this isn't a panel this is a

890
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:30,450
gathering of friends and it's just

891
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:32,339
blowing me away I'm gonna cry here half

892
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:35,250
of you are the reason I'd probably be in

893
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:35,400
jail the other half I know would bail me

894
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,660
out

895
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:41,220
remember you're all unindicted

896
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:49,799
accomplices a stranger is just an

897
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:52,618
asshole you've not met yet so so I

898
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:54,599

to explain what it's like on the

927
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,430
opposite end of dealing with these folks

928
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:34,690
and their shenanigans right because you

929
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,879
know as we're running a come on please

930
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:39,940
just just just give us the bill and

931
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,920
we'll figure this out the things that we

932
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,320
hear over our radios as these things are

933
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,670
going on like hey there's a at six

934
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,170
o'clock in the morning hey there's a bra

935
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,940
hanging from the ceiling of the Hyatt

936
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,250
does anybody know how to get it down and

937
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,810
who do we even contact for that isn't

938
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,790
you know those types of things that we

939
00:41:52,810 --> 00:42:00,580
we hear over the radio are just

940
00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:02,560
hilarious and fun yeah as a 15-story

941
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,180
drop like there's no easy way of getting

942
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,740
it I don't know Emerson like I think

943
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,060
we're trying to figure out the math like

944
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,439
I'm not even out there let's hit the

945
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:13,810
climb on the side where they got like

946
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:15,369
risking life you know like what was

947
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:18,009
happening and so we're all confusing

948
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:20,460
then it will from from the high comas or

949
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:22,290
because like I said a bra on the ceiling

950
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,310
like how do you how does that even get

951
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,740
up these like I don't even know you guys

952
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:27,509
are crazy and so uh you know it's it's

953
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,430
it's it's always been fun on the other

954
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:31,140
side of it as well because you know you

955
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,000
hear hey they're spanking people too

956
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,140
hard outside of the lobbying people

957
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,640
think to get inside you have to get

958
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,620
spanked like no no no make sure it's

959
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,210
clear you need to go somewhere else down

960
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,029
the road on the side you know it's not

961
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:43,620
not to be here so we've had fun on the

962
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:47,610
shenanigan side on the backside too so

963
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:49,140
lemme rants having like what other con

964
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:50,280

966
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,660
go to the hotel front desk and say do

967
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,940
you have a compressor we can borrow

968
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,730

somebody did that by hand

971
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,960
we gotta thank Kelly for that actually

972
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,240
so what happened is writers like I

973

third Street dive are you ready so

1001
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,440
because of Renderman like opening up and

1002
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,570
doing the whole Konya thing it got me to

1003
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,670
start thinking about my own shit that I

1004
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:30,210
had been like just you know bottling up

1005
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:31,920
for years mm-hmm and then that

1006
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:34,140
eventually led to me talking about it

1007
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,440
and you know on stage and

1008
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,848
eventually than the village and last

1009
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,359
year I thought it was just gonna be like

1010
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:47,339
a one-time thing right mm-hmm so we we

1011
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:50,339
did the fundraiser and ended up with

1012
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:53,249
what we have now and nonprofit like well

1013
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:55,319
like full-bore we have we have a list

1014
00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:56,430
too if you want to stop I have

1015
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:59,450
everything that we've actually been able

1016
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:04,348
to accomplish this last year which is

1017
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:06,720
blew my mind but I've cried so much that

1018
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:08,849
last year like there were almost every

1019
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,769
single talk it was just like just a

1020
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:14,039
whole room of people just sitting there

1021
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:15,450
just bawling just super hurtful stories

1022
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:16,890
of a lot of struggles that people held

1023
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:20,609
dealt with and how they dealt with it

1024
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:25,529
and just this huge peer support I told

1025
00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:27,690
you was gonna cry on stage kidding how

1026
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:29,460
my friend says was sitting next to me is

1027
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,930
the first or weekend he went to and he's

1028
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:36,930
like only you could get an entire

1029
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:40,470
roomful of guys to just bawl so yeah it

1030
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:42,299
was it was just so seem to be super

1031
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:44,629
helpful for everybody in the room to

1032
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:46,769
just realize that they weren't alone and

1033
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:49,170
everybody then just started to opening

1034
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:50,788
up and it was like a full talk going on

1035
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:52,589
but then it started to be just this

1036
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:54,059
conversation of like oh yeah like I

1037
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:57,210
think about suicide all the time and

1038
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:59,160
everybody's just I'm super glad like I

1039
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,829
brought tissues to the room specifically

1040
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,629
for that but yeah that was I think

1041
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:05,489
probably my biggest fear jerker mom I

1042
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,170
was all over last year

1043
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:08,609
you know of all the villages your

1044
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,829
village is my favorite the reason for

1045
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:13,589
this is it in PO SEC will have very

1046
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:15,299
stressful jobs like doing IR for example

1047
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:16,980
you're on call you're always worried

1048
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:18,180
you're always you'd start twitching when

1049
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,930
your phone vibrates it was just a friend

1050
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:23,190
to go for a drink and I actually had my

1051
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:26,160
own personal mental health issue that

1052
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:27,509
you know thankfully gives your village I

1053
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,279
want to be able to talk about it and

1054
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:30,749
changing careers because of it I was

1055
00:46:29,279 --> 00:46:32,369
working red team and blue team

1056
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:34,950
management and I had a stress-induced

1057
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:37,289
panic attack managing him while managing

1058
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:39,269
an entire other team and I was doing a

1059
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:41,130
blue code upgrade and I felt sudden left

1060
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:42,209
side chest pain I woke up in the

1061
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,660
hospital cuz they thought I was having a

1062
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,400
heart attack

1063
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,049
it turned out it was a stress-induced

1064
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,230
panic attack and

1065
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,730
[Music]

1066
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:50,230
I went on medical leave and they like

1067
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,730
kept calling me under my leaves so I had

1068
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,590
to go get out and bale change jobs

1069
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,600
thankfully I did a job interview with

1070
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:58,119

night with x-force red and somehow I'm a

1072
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:08,920
diversity hire now but I don't think

1073
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:09,640
that's how that works according to their

1074
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,470
system

1075
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:15,250
drag queens count under a diversity hire

1076
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:18,160
category sex workers work I'll take it

1077
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:19,750

1078
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,759

1092
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:59,230
uplifting one oh dude the auctions

1093
00:47:54,119 --> 00:48:01,180
wasn't there a year that we won $64,000

1094
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:02,260
all right so here's the beginning who

1095
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:05,560
here knows about the hackers for charity

1096
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:09,280
auction the live auction makes more

1097
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:11,529
money with this conferences say 2500

1098
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,180
people then all of Def Con

1099
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,770
there was one year we totaled it up and

1100
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:18,129
it was the equivalent of like every

1101
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:24,009
person every attendee like gave a

1102
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:25,210
hundred bucks like it was nuts but then

1103
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:27,880
oh yeah yeah that's the best part the

1104
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:30,190
hacker freakin Santa and buys all this

1105
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,020
you know buys everything all the auction

1106
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,880
then he just throws that furry bit like

1107
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,410
he's like ready he's literally taking

1108
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,650
twelve hundred dollars and setting on

1109
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:40,930
fire because why not he's donating it

1110
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:43,420
and then like I mean same thing

1111
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:45,910
Khaleel unless my charity actually like

1112
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,710
lights money on fire then it would be I

1113
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:48,879
will set like hundred dollars in fire

1114
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:52,510
for you for grades and donate the rest

1115
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,800
to charity it'll be Canadian money so

1116
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,970
it's not worth anything anyway that's

1117
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,859
perfect

1118
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:59,500

1119
00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:00,730
Khalil pilgrim he won the the black

1120
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,450
