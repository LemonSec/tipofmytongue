the art of BC and the initial name of

7
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,009
the presentation when I submitted it was

8
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,440
what three years of fighting has taught

9
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,550
us I actually looked and I realized I

10
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,410
was like crap I've actually been doing

11
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,480
this stuff before here so kind of slight

12
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,920
changing of the name and whatnot and

13
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,290
then I also switched jobs and everything

14
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,390
so this actual this name of the talk is

15
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,070
actually what four years and nine nine

16
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,000

gauri I'm on the Gauri's acid team to

21
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,860
put that into context what we do is we

22
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,660
troll Nigerians and we were to put it

23
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,190
lightly and what we do is we go ahead

24
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,660
and try and figure out how all this

25
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,790
stuff works and that's why we talked to

26
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,470
you guys about today I'm also a hacker

27
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,269
things some of you guys may know me as I

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,420
heart malware on the Twittersphere I

29
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,740
also like cooking too so we um if you

30
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,059

00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,260
you guys want to talk fermenting

32
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,720
vegetables and one that I'd be more than

33
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,010
happy to do that in the past I've done a

34
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,080
lot of work on the apt side

35
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,239
apt one was my jamm there for a while

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,400
also did some work on the query side

37
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,780
with the Dyer family malware and I also

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,810
like troubling just having fun because

39
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,190
InfoSec is very hard for a lot of people

40
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,709
and it's just if we laugh and have fun

41
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,150
it makes it so much more better so the

42
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,890
things I'll be talking about today I

43
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,900
will go ahead and be talking about what

44
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,149
the industry defines as visiting I'll

45
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,010
compromise and there's there's a

46
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,110
definition of what the industry calls it

47
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,130
and there's a definition of what people

48
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,989
who are actually fighting this stuff on

49
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,250
the day-to-day basis call it I'm gonna

50
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,350
show you guys how but what both

51
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,640
definitions of that are I'll go ahead

52
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,220
and talk to you about romance scams and

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,529
how that plays into the EC and we to

54
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,090
also be talking about a lot of the other

55
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,400
overlapping crimes that are associated

56
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,220
with BC as well I'll show you guys some

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,810
bad rap videos as associated with a lot

58
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,030
of the Nigerian fraud and now I'll go

59
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,320
ahead and talk to you guys about where

60
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,880
we can go from here and how do we

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,030
actually start combating this stuff I

62
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,590
also have lulz of BC so if you are

63
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,540
familiar with the Mally's that usually

64
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,970
happen at like fireEye summit and Amir

65
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,260
Khan it's a lot of really funny dumb

66
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,190
things that make you tilt your head and

67
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,959
go WTF and we see

68
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,609
really interesting things by the actors

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,280
so let's we'll go ahead and laugh about

70
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,960
that for some of the material that I

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,750
will be talking about some of the

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,460
material is TLP red so that means for a

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,200
TLP red that means if you're in this

74
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,600
room it doesn't go outside of that and

75
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,459
everything TLP white is something you

76
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,950
tell you grandmother TLP green is

77
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,570
something you tell a friend TLP D amber

78
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,010
is something you could tell a colleague

79
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,950
and to help you read too seriously don't

80
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,599
go outside of that however I got the

81
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,000
approval to talk on some of this stuff

82
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,040
at the TLP white level just because this

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,960
is the last door become this is my first

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,340
Derby con this is the first or become

85
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,530
speaking at and this is the last door

86
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,719
become speaking at so all of the

87
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,909
material is now considered TLP white so

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,170
thank you to the victim who gave us the

89
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,160
permission to be able to use that and

90
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,020
you'll go ahead you'll be meeting her

91
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,330
here shortly

92
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,710
disclaimer you see is nasty and there's

93
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,570
a lot of topics I'm gonna be covering

94
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,849
here um some people may find it

95
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,320
offensive and whatnot I'm not a person

96
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,910
to sugarcoat things I'm gonna tell you

97
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,900
all the truth and how it is and if it's

98
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,790
something where if it's awkward for

99
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,190
y'all I'm sorry but this is just this

100
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,660
just nature of the beast and everything

101
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,669
and most importantly just be excellent

102
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,750
to each other the BC stuff and a lot of

103
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:10,060
stuff that's going on from the

104
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,919
psychological side it's hard it's rough

105
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,120
and wahb and there's a lot of victims

106
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,440
out there who's seeing a lot of this

107
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,070
stuff and they're the ones who are being

108
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:21,400
affected the most of this so with that

109
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:24,640
let's go ahead and get started what is

110
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,190
be easy so initially when people think

111
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,289
of VEC when we talk about BC if you go

112
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,090
and do a quick google search of what VEC

113
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,770
is in the industry it's usually

114
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,409
something simple most people will see

115
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,109
okay my CFO received an email from the

116
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,120
pretending to be the CEO and as they go

117
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,130
through and everything the CEO CFO the

118
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,780
CEO is like hey can you go ahead do wire

119
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,820
transfer for me see if I was like yep

120
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,109
I'll do the transfer for you and then at

121
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,790
that point the monies could end they'll

122
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,220
go ahead and continue talking back and

123
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,530
forth an account will be funded to these

124
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,060
to the CFO or the port or the victim and

125
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,760
then the mic gets wired and it's gone

126
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,840
from there on the surface it may seem

127
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,450
very simple like that but there's

128
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,159
actually a little bit more to it so me I

129
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,919
started looking at this stuff back in

130
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,990
June of 2015 I was overfish me and our

131
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,659
CFO would received an email and he said

132
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,610
hey what is this I'll get it so we went

133
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,630
we took that email we responded back to

134
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,820
the scammer we're like oh

135
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,140
hey the CFO he's out of the office but

136
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,040
I'll be more than happy to respond I'll

137
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,169
be more than happy to handle that

138
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,520
request so but to the attacker they

139
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,620
didn't know this was somebody in the

140
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,030
middle of that conversation so we went

141
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,640
head and we work with them we got a bank

142
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,719
account we sent him a link we got that

143
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,099
person to click the link and everything

144
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,260
we're about we were hot stuff at that

145
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,360
point yes we're engaging with the actors

146
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,340
we're doing active defense not hacking

147
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,510
back is something different but we

148
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,549
thought we were really cool doing that

149
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,280
and then as we started looking at that

150
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,410
from like June 2015 to December 2015

151
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,849
it just started BC started becoming a

152
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,110
problem it just kept getting bigger and

153
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,850
bigger and bigger the more we looked at

154
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,130
it the more we started talking with

155
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:54,010
people so I was introduced to an agent

156
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,600
from up in New York and I was talking

157
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,830
with him I'm like hey there's a lot of

158
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,110
people in the industry who's seeing this

159
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,490
stuff let's go ahead and actually start

160
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,750
trying to combat this stuff I said let's

161
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,640
go ahead and try to do some

162
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,170
collaboration between the private sector

163
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,300
and between law enforcement to start

164
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,350
doing this stuff and you can talk with

165
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,490
on the phone you can help he's like yeah

166
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,560
whatever tell a couple of your friends

167
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,910
to come fight be easy so I called them

168
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,470
back three days later I said hey if

169
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,150
you're ready he's like what do you mean

170
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,680
is if you're ready I said I've got a

171
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,030
hundred other security researchers who

172
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,960
are ready to start associate hearing

173
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,700
these people and feeding you guys

174
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,739
intelligence I said are you ready for

175
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,969
the for the flow and you could tell his

176
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,180
job is dropped on the ploy he's like

177
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,920
what so um so at that point he was able

178
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,080
to go and get a couple of more people to

179
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,580
come help out with that and everything

180
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,780
at that point that was we had another

181
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,090
ten agents on there and that was when

182
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,080
the BGC list was born it's a it's an

183
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,700
environment where we can share

184
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,630
information at the TLP ride level and a

185
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,520
bunch of people and it's very

186
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,840
operational and we were like yes a

187
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,729
hundred and ten people we can go and

188
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,369
fight this Nigerian fraud thing we've

189
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,010
got this and the more we started looking

190
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,140
at we realized we don't got this we

191
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,849
realized that that that little red dot

192
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,740
that you see up there that was us at the

193
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,890
time that was our knowledge of what we

194
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,630
thought the EC was and three years in as

195
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,310
we started looking I we're like okay we

196
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,140
have a little bit of an idea on what B

197
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,600
EC is we know a little bit of the

198
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,890
intricacies that work that work on it at

199
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,840
that point we're like okay we've had

200
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,250
over 100 arrests we've sought millions

201
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,919
of dollars thousands of romance a

202
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,870
counselor Heaven wacked and it was so

203
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,120
going on there was still problems with

204
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,140
it and we couldn't understand why and

205
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,669
it's like governments were working

206
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,039
together we were working with Secret

207
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:25,419
Service IRS had a ton of other people to

208
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,050
just try to get getting ahead of this

209
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:29,359
and get an understanding of that

210
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,069
um so now that we're three years in

211
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,680
where did we stand at that point what

212
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:35,479
did we really learn so to put this in

213
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,949
iceberg format this is about where we

214
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:41,959
were right around December of 2018 and

215
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,610
that was kind of where we were and as we

216
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:46,430
kept going we're like okay there's a lot

217
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,019
more to this so from somebody who fights

218
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:49,519
this stuff on a day-to-day basis from

219
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:51,560
somebody who works with a lot of law

220
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,010
enforcement how what do what is the

221
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,459
actual definition of Dec to put it very

222
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,720
lightly

223
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:01,339
Dec is a dumpster fire but not just one

224
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,170
dumpster fire it's actually about six

225
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:04,459
dumpster fires but then again what you

226
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,140
need to do is take those six dumpster

227
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:07,699
fires and then throw ninjas on top of

228
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,380
that and then if you have a couple

229
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,149
Photoshop trapdoors holdin bombs and

230
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,459
have some more fire and then have people

231
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:14,870
throwing gasoline on top of it that's

232
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:16,518
pretty much where we've that's where we

233
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,690
can that's where BC stands it's an

234
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,649
absolute mess and I can prove that

235
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,899
mathematically I can prove that this is

236
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:25,130
actually a dumpster fire it's a mess so

237
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:28,459
there was statistics that came out

238
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:31,459
through IC 3 and in 2015 the total

239
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:34,550
losses the total known losses to BC frog

240
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:36,920
has doubled every single year since 2015

241
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,969
and okay that was one number that came

242
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,430
out what are some other numbers that

243
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,110
came out when it comes to doing fraud

244
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,459
Vince I like to look at the numbers that

245
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,020
come at FinCEN because they're kind of

246
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,640
governing body that sees a lot of stuff

247
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,360
and they work back and forth with

248
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,149
financials so for all of 2018 they came

249
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,670
out and they said we have lost 300

250
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,529
million dollars per month and so it was

251
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,439
a total of 3.6 billion dollars for all

252
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:02,329
of 2018 and with a lot of numbers like

253
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,700
that could be like okay 300 dollars

254
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:06,680
what's that mean in context so I'm a

255
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,510
reverse engineer by trade I did a lot of

256
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,739
reversing an hour back in my day so I'll

257
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,660
go ahead and convert it into malware

258
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,459
losses for some for something all so

259
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,230
let's take a look at GAMEOVER Zeus made

260
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,420
headlines it was something where caused

261
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,980
a lot of problems operated for two years

262
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,719
the total losses associated with

263
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,029
GAMEOVER Zeus was a hundred million

264
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,000
dollars what we call that on a day of

265
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:27,890
fighting BC is we call that ten days and

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,769
one in the case of one a crime something

267
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,670
that claimed in national headlines

268
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,050
estimates for the damage we're four

269
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,510
billion that were four billion dollars

270
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,800
in damage and okay I'll go ahead and

271
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,420
give it was a marking number some

272
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,709
security company pulled it out of their

273
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,339
butts on that one and well now I'll go

274
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:42,829
ahead and give it to

275
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,259
not for this we call that 13 months of

276
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:47,508
fighting Dec let's go ahead and take a

277
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:48,860
look at a more recent one gang crab they

278
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:50,509
were like we went and we did three

279
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,850
hundred million dollars in damages they

280
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:56,029
went and cast out all this money again

281
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,519
that's called one month not Pat yeah 1.2

282
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,470
billion in global damages that was four

283
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,629
months for you guys who remember looking

284
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,540
at Sony and the attacks associated with

285
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:08,389
that the losses were estimated to be are

286
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,480
the loss of the IT loss costs were 35

287
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:12,800
million dollars or possibly up to a

288
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,930
hundred million dollars again going back

289
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,089
to that marketing word or that marketing

290
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,529
total that was because marketing teams

291
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:21,439
would never inflate numbers in order to

292
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:23,059
make them look big and that is a called

293
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:25,579
three and a half days or 10 days of

294
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:27,079
flying VEC and again another more recent

295
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:30,378
rest let's go ahead and take a look at

296
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:31,579
God's name again since 2016 that one was

297
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:34,279
responsible for a hundred million

298
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:36,469
dollars again ten days of fighting VEC

299
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:38,629
and I do want to kind of throw a

300
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,399
disclaimer out there that when I went

301
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:42,470
and crunched these numbers that was just

302
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,389
from the fencin numbers there were new

303
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,910
metrics that came out from the FBI

304
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:49,910
talking about roaming out scams and they

305
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,559
were saying that for so I got right it

306
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,649
was three hundred and sixty two million

307
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:57,410
dollars was lost to romance scams for

308
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,639
2018 so and there was a bunch of other

309
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,740
numbers that have come out since then I

310
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,179
was too feeling too lazy actually go

311
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,410
back and crunch those numbers to see

312
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,449
what those would be what they would be

313
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,399
so those numbers are actually really big

314
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:09,079
so it's actually the opposite of this

315
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,420
case where there's actually a lot more

316
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,849
losses going on that people realize so

317
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,819
joking aside numbers aside what do we go

318
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,620
ahead and what is B EC so as we

319
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,329
understand business email compromise is

320
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,319
kind of becoming a lot more if than

321
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,660
everything and there's a lot more going

322
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:25,160
on with it so one of the things that are

323
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,629
associated with it is we know romance

324
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,610
games are very closely tied to it

325
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:30,379
wire fraud obviously something in there

326

332
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:44,569
it as we continue going through that

333
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,029

shopper scams drug trafficking it's

338
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,130

342
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,540

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,310
of Nigerian for all that I'm messin and

344
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,170
when we look at me II see the more we

345
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,270
understand it it's something where no

346
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,520
matter how much an organization tries to

347
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,590
say they do B EC there is no single

348
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,210
organization that exists that can solve

349
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:18,740
every single one of these problems for

350
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,790
you add something where we all have to

351
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,280
go ahead and come together to look at

352
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,990
that so you're probably looking these

353
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,760
kind of skeptical be like really romance

354
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,310
scams how does this have to do anything

355
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,050
with BC what's the connections with

356
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,180
their rotting yeah believe it or not

357
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,400
they're actually very much related

358
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,170
anytime that you see a B EC scheme um if

359
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,689
the attacker gives you an account that

360
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,729
ties back to a name more times not that

361
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,350
a name on that account is actually a

362
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,570
romance victim and the way that those

363
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,070
work is some another attacker will still

364
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,560
change in here the romance victim and

365
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:51,020
they will go ahead and tell the scammer

366
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,099
who's doing the B EC hey here's a victim

367
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,829
that go you can go ahead and wire money

368
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,720
to and then once that once the wire goes

369
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,820
out and everything the romance scammer

370
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,950
will work with with the victim or their

371
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,270
romance client is that they call and say

372
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:05,300
hey you're going to be expecting a

373
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,560
payment from a vendor for $25,000 go

374
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,750
ahead and take it and wire it out to

375
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,790
this account and in one case that we

376
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,490
were looking at actors are doing a lot

377
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,420
more than just the EC schemes with one

378
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,580
of the attackers that we're looking at

379
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,290
during our BC engagements they were

380
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,730
doing Craigslist scams they were sending

381
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,099
fake checks they were doing work from

382
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,230
home scams and also on the romance side

383
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,510
they were also engaged they were using

384
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,010
they were targeting farmers dating they

385
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,170
were targeting people dating on Ashley

386
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,939
Madison BDSM dating websites and tax

387
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,329
fraud and again this was all literally

388
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,550
the statement bucks for the same scammer

389
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:39,920
so as again as we look at everything

390
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,500
when a lot of these romance scammers are

391
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,880
actually engaged the a lot of the people

392
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,800
who are doing this type of fraud don't

393
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,390
actually save romance gamma or a romance

394
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,150
victim because to them the way that they

395
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:52,460
they describe it is that victim scam

396
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,470
that's considered a dirty word so when

397
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,880
they're engaging with these people they

398
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,500
actually call them their clients and

399
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,030
it's something where that's one of the

400
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,950
things that they help to legitimize that

401
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,630
business of use them as mules in order

402
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,920
to wire the stuff so it's something

403
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,840
where again if you see that bank account

404
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,880
and if you see names hide back to that

405
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,250
more times than not that's

406
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,870
thing where that ties back to a romance

407
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,819
victim almost almost one to one in that

408
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,870
case and as you go ahead and look

409
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:16,370
through it's like okay

410
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,709
romance victim they should totally know

411
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,750
they're part of this their domination

412
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,880
why don't they now well if we start

413
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,560
looking at psychology something that is

414
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,689
come again completely outside of bits

415
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,619
and bytes of info sack does anybody

416
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:32,829
remember dating before before now does a

417
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,829
baby

418
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,149
dating back today where he actually had

419
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,860
to muster up the courage and go talk to

420
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,880
that significant other hey you're cute I

421
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,839
want to talk to you can't buy you a

422
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,670
drink

423
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,019
and something where we had to muster up

424
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,759
that courage if that person was sitting

425
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:51,050
there with a group of people we may not

426
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,430
want to go talk to that people because

427
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,189
we may not have the confidence to do

428
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,508
that however now in the dating scene

429
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,100
it's something where all you needs an

430
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:59,300
app on your phone then you could pick up

431
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,850
and start dating and talking to people

432
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,500
and there's no fear of rejection when

433
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,660
trying to talk back and forth of people

434
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,610
I know people will have a lot more

435
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,930
confidence as talking back and forth to

436
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,899
individuals on the Internet

437
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,399
for better or for worse if you want to

438
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:15,259
do some really fun stories check out our

439
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,410
tinder on reddit lots of really really

440
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:19,699
funny things that happen there and

441
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:22,670
additionally when people are talking on

442
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:24,709
the internet people lie and as as quoted

443
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,349
by Abraham Lincoln um it's something

444
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:28,880
where as we go through this people are

445
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,040
able to go ahead and hide who they are

446
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,779
and this is how a lot of these scammers

447
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,849
work is they'll pretend they'll use fake

448
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:35,870
accounts of fake personas in order to

449
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,509
start engaging with these victims

450
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,220
associations near them as for the prime

451
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:41,750
targets of a lot of this thing's people

452
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,670
are either single divorced or widowed

453
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,050
and it's people like this who end up

454
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,579
being part of that and being pulled into

455
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,380
that and when you actually start looking

456
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:49,670
at the psychology of this if we all

457
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,410
remember back to high school health

458
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,000
class one of the biggest stressors that

459
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,160
we have in life is losing a spouse

460
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,649
losing a significant other and in almost

461
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,540
every case that I've seen where there's

462
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:02,000
a victim and in the case of roaming up

463
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,158
scams it's something where that person

464
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,619
is just lonely I was talking I was on my

465
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:08,480
way to blackhat a couple couple weeks

466
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,770

467
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,069
ride and everything I got to talk to a

468
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,209
lady who was there and she was

469
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,220

470

lost custody of my kids and the reason

481
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,470
I'm an uber driver is because I had to

482
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,330
file bankruptcy for my business she was

483
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,669
like I was a couple years away I had a

484
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,139
good business I was looking to and the

485
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:48,169
way it was working was I was going to

486
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,820
invest into into a business in Nigeria

487
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:50,480
and she just got on the wrong side of

488
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,760
that and every

489
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,710
and I told her I said I'm curious what

490
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,600
was it that was so enticing from the

491
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,460
romance side that got you engaged in

492
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,959
that and everything and you could tell

493
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,370
that it was kind of a not really a

494
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,750
hurtful question and everything but it

495
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,668
was it was hard for her and she's like

496
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,830
my husband was abusive to me and this

497
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,330
person came in and was saying the right

498
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,789
words in the right order and was showing

499
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,678
me love and as humans that's all we want

500
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,029
is we just want that's just part of our

501
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,529
human nature's we want to be loved by

502
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:18,289
somebody else and that's not a bad thing

503
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:19,580
so in order to engage with romance

504
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:20,750
victims one of the things that the

505
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,240
scammers will do is they'll use what

506
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,350
they call romance scripts or formats so

507
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,200
I would go ahead and introduce you to

508
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,418
Larry he's a 62 and without he has both

509
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,070
three two and three kids um and the way

510
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:32,750
that this works is they will go ahead

511
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,279
and use scripts like this in order to

512
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,110
copy paste back and forth to their

513
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,940
victims and the reason that they do this

514
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:39,949
is because they don't have to go ahead

515
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,269
and engage with somebody else and they

516
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,519
can go ahead and just copy paste this

517
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:45,409
and not think about it um some of the

518
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:49,190
scripts and formats that I've seen will

519
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:50,990
go up to 28 layers deep before the actor

520
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,059
actually has to think about having a

521
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,830
response back to them and it's one of

522
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:57,230
those things were in many cases there's

523
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,449
actually debugging information so that

524
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,100
if your victim becomes aware of some of

525
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,110
what's going on they can go ahead and

526
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,730
change that it's something where it's

527
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,408
not just elderly who's being targeted -

528
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,139
they have space-efficient they have

529
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:10,010
fetish based scripts as well say that

530
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:11,928
five times fast

531
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,010
uh-huh and in this case one of the

532
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,059
scripts that we were looking at from the

533
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,139
actor um

534
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:16,399
they were assuming the role of a

535
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:18,350
dominatrix and they said you're going to

536
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:20,809
go ahead and buy the sex kit and you're

537
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:23,360
gonna go ahead and use gift cards in

538
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,158
order to pay for it and we actually had

539
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,769
to have a serious conversation at work

540
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:29,870
on whether being told to go buy gift

541
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:32,510
cards which is part being told to go do

542
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,399
something was actually part if it was

543
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,480
actually legitimate um so it was

544
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:37,729
something where we became to the

545
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,080
determination know that being told to go

546
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,700
buy gift cards even though being told to

547
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,279
do something as part of that is part of

548
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,440
the King um that we came to the

549
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,360
conclusion was that no it's it's still

550
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,950
considered a scam and when you actually

551
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,689
talked with a lot of the victims the

552
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,940
attacker is actually used them as human

553
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,039
proxies so if money needs to be wired

554
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,559
from one point to another they'll go

555
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,360
ahead and say hey um go ahead and go do

556
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,889
this for me go opening me a bank account

557
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,570
I'm gonna go ahead and send you fake

558
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:03,740
checks I'm not fake checks I'm gonna go

559
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,980
ahead and send you some checks I need to

560
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,559
go

561
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,090
and ship them out and a lot of the

562
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,620
victims I have spoken with a lot of the

563
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,330
victims I've heard a lot of the stories

564
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,040
I've seen they actually feel like

565
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,678
they're in a relationship they actually

566
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,409
think that what they're doing is for

567
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,910
their lover in some cases I've seen up

568
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,559
to 10 years for victims who were being

569
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,160
part of this and everything and it's

570
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,010
something where it's absolutely

571
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,570
heartbreaking to see that what that a

572
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,860
lot of them feel that was that a lot of

573
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,809
them seem like they're feel like they're

574
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,969
in a relationship the problem with that

575
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:34,370
is now when you go ahead you go talked

576
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,169
with that victim that everything that

577
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,320
they know for that relationship over the

578
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:40,850
last 10 years is wrong now that Vic now

579
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,928
that victim starts questioning a lot of

580
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,540
what they do so from a psychological

581
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:46,309
perspective there's a lot of damage that

582
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,110
happens there and it's something where

583
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:49,970
it's really hard to deal with a lot of

584
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,990
them and unfortunately suicide

585
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,549
depression is something that goes

586
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,980
hand-in-hand with a lot of stuff and

587
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,299
there's I've seen many victims who

588
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,429
unfortunately have taken their lives

589
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,809
because they feel like they have given

590
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:01,400
all their money out to the scammer and

591
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:02,960
they have nothing else to live for and

592
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,100
unfortunately that's just the nature of

593
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,840
the beast is that the a lot of these

594
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,939
actors actually have blood on their

595
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,370
hands now because this is kind of how

596
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,260
far they're pushing some of the people

597
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,459
but as as information security

598
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,049
professionals were like okay a lot of

599
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,070
these users they're dumb why they should

600
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,780
have known better they should have know

601
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,770
that they were as part of the scam but

602
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,090
one of the things you have to keep in

603
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,610
mind is they're all there is also a

604
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,110
generation gap a lot of people are not

605
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,790
wired like all of us a lot of people

606
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,530
don't question whether this toaster that

607
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,270
we that I just bought that has a Wi-Fi

608
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,610
chip in it is Gibby phoning home to

609
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:35,210
China your regular general public public

610
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,740
does not give a crap about that does it

611
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,169
make toast that's what they care about

612
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,340
and that's something where they just

613
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:41,900
because people have different knowledge

614
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,090
it doesn't make it less stupid or than

615
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,470
the other it's just as we went through

616
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,689
life we've all gained different sets of

617
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,790
knowledge so do you know what the

618
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,590
logistics are in order to go ahead and

619
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,480
what the costs are for gasoline in order

620
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,580
to get from one place to another can you

621
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,200
identify the HIV proteins that are

622
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,909
associated with that and it's something

623
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,980
where most people in here can't answer

624
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,179
that hell I can't answer that but it's

625
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,110
something where again we all getting

626
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:05,120
different knowledge as we're going

627
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,010
through it's something where just

628
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,299
because a lot of these scammers are will

629
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,190
keep working back and forth with people

630
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,629
again it doesn't make something more or

631
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,549
less stupid than the other it's just we

632
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,780
have different knowledge as we've gone

633
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:16,610
through and a lot of people are not

634
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,510
sceptic or not naturally skeptical of

635
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,040
everything

636
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,360
and believe it or not we are the weird

637
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,430
ones we're the ones who question

638
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,929
everything and when we go outside to go

639
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,670
talk with the people who are walking on

640
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,800
the street they're the ones who are not

641
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,570
seeing this and they're like okay yes I

642
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,159
have a toaster and it works yeah can I

643
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,320
get my Wi-Fi it works what what's the

644
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,700
problem there so so it's something where

645
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,320
we need to actually stop having this

646
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,550
elitist attitude on a lot of this stuff

647
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,470
and actually start having a little

648
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,760
compassion for people because it's one

649
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,990
of those things where these are the

650
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,120
these are the people who are associated

651
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,470
with this with this scheme these are the

652
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,330
people who are stealing billions of

653
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,400
dollars from our companies this is now

654
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,199
our problem it's not VEC is not just a

655
00:22:49,400 --> 00:23:01,880
tech problem anymore it's now becoming a

656
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:03,650
people problem thank you thank you so

657
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,270
one of the things that we do I work with

658
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,620
at agari is we do a lot of active

659
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,930
engagements and we actually engage with

660
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,520
the scammers and we have some internal

661
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,230
tools that are proprietary that we gain

662
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,450
a lot of visibility into how a lot of

663
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,460
stuff works so we were looking at one of

664
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:18,440
our accounts that we had and we went

665
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,060
ahead and as we were going through we

666
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,190
were able to see that there was a lot of

667
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,050
communications back and forth but when

668
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,820
we were looking at one of the actors we

669
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,860
saw okayed the Jim Blackie account there

670
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,629
was a lot of information there and there

671
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,429
was a lot of information going back with

672
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,690
the Susan white and it was something

673
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,700
where we didn't really understand what

674
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,010
was going on there as we started looking

675
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,600
at we use a tool that can go ahead and

676
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,640
start clustering and looking at a lot of

677
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,560
that information to understand what was

678
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,910
going on um and kind of start looking to

679
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,159
some of the keywords that was going on

680
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,440
and you see things like love and baby

681
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,850
and things like that so we knew at that

682
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,170
point it was this was more than likely

683
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,909
of romance victim that we were looking

684
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,130
at that the scammer was look was

685
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,750
interacting with and again that we were

686
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,310
tipped off to this as part of a VEC

687
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,070
engagement and they were doing be seeing

688
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,960
this in the same in the same account so

689
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,820
once we go ahead and sort looking at the

690
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,640
Acuras camera communication we were able

691
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,740
to find this one here and again Susan is

692
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,850
not her actual name um it was we kind of

693
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,190
mask that in order to protect her

694
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,260
identity but you see here my tax guy

695
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,660
just asked me about my 401k hoping that

696
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,980
I did not just cash it out um I'm gonna

697
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,700
attack sit on that and I had those

698
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:25,010
$60,000 or it was $60,000 for a 401k and

699
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,170
as you see you have there's a couple of

700
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,920
the letters on there you see the MSN FNP

701
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:32,530
CCDs and with those letters she was in

702
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,340
and those are actual nursing

703
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,170
certificates she has a degree in

704
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,540
everything and it was something where

705
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:40,820
again she wouldn't really remind you of

706
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,428
what typical user of a typical dumb user

707
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,260
is as quote so I can go ahead and keep

708
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:46,900
saying her story and everything but the

709
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,020
person who says it best is actually

710
00:24:46,900 --> 00:25:04,420
herself

711
00:24:48,020 --> 00:25:04,420
I think the most handsome I get though I

712
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:13,190
joined match.com started you know

713
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:17,440
looking at some of the profiles and the

714
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:20,960
pictures I think the most handsome

715
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:25,760
gentleman that I saw on there was Jim

716
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:30,140
Blackie I sent a message to him he told

717
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:35,150
me what he did and he told me that he

718
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:38,240
was a civil engineer and built roads and

719
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:42,410
rail you could tell he was very very

720
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:45,559
excited um that he got this contract he

721
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:47,110
didn't tell me how much it was worth but

722
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,660
said that it was a very lucrative

723
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:55,389
contract for him and he couldn't pass it

724
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:59,750
up and he would be going to South Africa

725
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:01,370
the first time he asked me for money he

726
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:09,500
said you know if you could just send me

727
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:11,719
ten thousand dollars I can pay for some

728
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,460
workers to do the work until I can

729
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,150
figure out what to do about this other

730
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,150
situation

731
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:28,580
I went to my church and I prayed

732
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:39,470
because I didn't know what to do he

733
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:42,559
asked me again for the money and he

734
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:46,370
basically wore me down when it came time

735
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:51,289
for him to be paid for the job and to

736
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:54,289
leave he said that there was a problem

737
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:57,070
with the amount of money so he sent me

738
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:59,749
an email telling me that they paid him

739
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:02,418
thirty million dollars to do this job

740
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:06,649
his reason that he couldn't get the

741
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:08,629
money was that the South African

742
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:11,570
government wouldn't allow that amount of

743
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:16,129
money to leave the country for some

744
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:20,299
reason after a few days I sent a few

745
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:23,240
thousand dollars you know I figured it

746
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:25,668
out pretty quickly you know what to say

747
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,710
and where to go and how much money I

748
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:30,649
could send without really being

749
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:33,440
questioned so I got cash advances on

750
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:35,149
credit cards pretty much maxed out well

751
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,139
I did maxed out all my credit cards I

752
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:42,998
opened one or two other credit cards and

753
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:48,979
I took out I think three personal loans

754
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:52,539
each for about 20,000 25,000 a piece and

755
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,539
wired those immediately

756
00:27:53,499 --> 00:28:05,869
so my bank was and they questioned me

757
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:07,789
the most and the woman that I was

758
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:11,720
working with that helped me with the

759
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:14,389
personal loan told me outright she said

760
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,340
we think this is fraud you know I came

761
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:19,100
up with an elaborate story as well

762
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:21,289
I was completely new to all of this I

763
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,889
mean I had never taken out a personal

764
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:30,769
loan before in my life my credit score

765
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:32,689
was 800 I had no debt in the end the

766
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:35,450
cash that I sent him was about four

767
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,570
hundred thousand dollars because I ended

768
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:40,210
up refinancing my home

769
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:42,820
so I really really needed someone to

770
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:46,899
come to me with some solid evidence that

771
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:49,739
this wasn't real and I hired the private

772
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:53,649
investigator she didn't find anything

773
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:56,169
she could only say that I'm suspicious

774
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:58,508
but I can't tell you what it is you know

775
00:28:56,169 --> 00:29:02,409
I'm just kind of been lost and alone in

776
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:04,450
this because I haven't told anyone no

777
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:07,090
one knew what was going on with my

778
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:10,210
situation or why all my money was gone

779
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:11,529
why I had to sell my house and move why

780
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:21,489
I had to take my kids out of their

781
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:22,869
school until I got an email from you and

782
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:25,059
at that point we had reached out to her

783
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:27,279
in order to cuz we saw that she was a

784
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:28,570
victim and we started working with her

785
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,340
in order to go ahead and actually start

786
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,389
trying to build a case against the

787
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,769
people who were scamming her because we

788
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:35,228
had an idea of who was where they were

789
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:38,289
coming from so ahem we went forward with

790
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:39,460
that so she said the most attractive

791
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:40,929
person that she saw in there was Jim

792
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,119
Blackie I don't know if people read

793
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,859
micro-expressions in here but if you saw

794
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,899
in the beginning she had a slight smile

795
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:49,178
when she said that so even after losing

796
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:52,570
all that money there was still some

797
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:53,619
happy emotions associated with that so

798
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,700
let's go ahead and take a look at missed

799
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:58,988
at who mr. Blackie is so as you see he's

800
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,320
a businessman likes to travel

801
00:29:58,989 --> 00:30:05,080
first-class somewhat well-dressed decent

802
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,090
looking guy and he likes drinking he

803
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,489
seems to like drinking champagne not

804
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:12,158
champagne but cocktails it likes to

805
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:13,869
travel but unfortunately as we started

806
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,359
looking at this those were actually

807
00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:18,399
stolen pictures and it's something where

808
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:20,470
a lot of people when they look at active

809
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,209
defense they're like okay active defense

810
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,159
is a buzz where people are not doing it

811
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,289
as something where it's just a marketing

812
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,659
term in order to go ahead and try and

813
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:31,149
make a dollar well so I will actually

814
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:33,009
have a counter-argument to that as this

815
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:35,529
was the last email that she had received

816
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:38,080
and the reason she had received this

817
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:40,359
from mr. Blackie was because that

818
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,369
because the actors worlds may have been

819
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:44,349
clogged closing down on them because

820
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:45,699
they're let's just say that they started

821
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:46,539
people started getting arrested when

822
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,999
this stuff went down

823
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:51,309
so let's actually take a look at who the

824
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:52,749
scammer was again there was this

825
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:55,990
active case I'm gonna go ahead and leave

826
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:57,370
his name as redacted but once he learned

827
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,779
that his accomplices were starting to be

828
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,139
arrested he decide to flee from South

829
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:03,100
Africa and went back home to Nigeria

830
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:05,139
unfortunately with this individual we

831
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,399
only knew about four of his passports

832
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:08,408
and he end up going out on a fifth one

833
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,059
but for the group there was fun there

834
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,230
was a total of five individuals involved

835
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:13,418
and four of them have been arrested

836
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,889
again can't really talk much on that

837
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:16,539
case because it's still pending you know

838
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:19,059
hopefully once it comes out we'll be

839
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:20,529
releasing more information on it before

840
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:22,658
the five people have been arrested on

841
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:23,919
that so let's go ahead and actually look

842
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:27,340
at some of the social media that this

843
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:30,159
person was was posing out there so on

844
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,689
mr. redacted Instagram post if you don't

845
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,970
learn how to get paid sleep you'll work

846
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,529
until you die um so that was one of his

847
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,499
views on some of the stuff is you gotta

848
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:40,659
go ahead and keep going um he also liked

849
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:43,269
really really really expensive cars this

850
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:45,070
was one of his Mercedes that he had and

851
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:47,499
here's another picture of him in a

852
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,119
decent-looking hotel um turns out it was

853
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:50,440
his birthday that day and he had a lot

854
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:52,840
of people actually like that and

855
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,279
everything I can't change that I can't

856
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,080
change the direction if I win but I can

857
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,929

00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:05,820
arrogance there he's like oh happy

863

as you can see he also likes traveling

864
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,159
business class as he said they're

865
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:15,490
sipping champagne and whatnot in one of

866
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,649
the in one of the planes and when I was

867
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,809
actually making waves actually redacting

868
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:21,998
a lot of this stuff I want to make a

869
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:24,908
confession this next picture I had a

870
00:32:21,999 --> 00:32:26,470
little bit of fun doing so this was

871
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:28,149
actually him and his buddies out in a

872
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,769
nightclub and they were sitting there

873
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:32,408
drinking champagne and doing a lot of

874
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:35,320
fun stuff and everything and and as you

875
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:36,759
see the facial expressions the guy third

876
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,779
from the third from the left was

877
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:40,090
actually a little bit drunk he was like

878
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:41,679
all like this and everything one of the

879
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,570
people who posted back is like hey why

880
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,159
hey mr. redacted why is your mouth open

881
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,619
and he's the one sit there going like

882
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:52,869
this and whatnot um and then yeah don't

883
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:53,769
forget and then don't forget this is

884
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:56,230
kind of some of the stuff that they're

885
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:57,909
doing it that they're sharing so as we

886
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:00,759
go ahead and start looking at this we

887
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,200
know it's a big problem and okay who do

888
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:04,450
we go ahead and blame for this and

889
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,020
everything so a lot of people will point

890
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,000
to socially

891
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,889
and be like hey social media you need to

892
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,030
do more on this banks you need to do

893
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,190
more on this law enforcement you either

894
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,480
arrest more people and everything

895
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:15,670
private industry you refuse to work with

896
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,990
law enforcement if anybody has followed

897
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,280
anything with Apple they straight up

898
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,440
this won't do anything for law

899
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,639
enforcement you have service providers

900
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,380
and everything they're like well we need

901
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,550
the service fries need to actually stop

902
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,920
this stuff they should be doing more on

903
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:28,360
it but at the end of the day we actually

904
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,830
need to be pointing back at ourselves on

905
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,240
a lot of this because it's something

906
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,159
where law enforcement cannot make

907
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,750
arrests until we actually work with them

908
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,160
we they can't make arrests that they

909
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:38,140
don't know who is being victimized and

910
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,220
if we're seeing that stuff we need to

911
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,559
actually work with them in order to

912
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,330
start closing that and likewise bank

913
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,830
banks cannot actually close those

914
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,990
accounts because they don't know about

915
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,669
it if I go ask my bank to open an

916
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,410
account they know I've been a customer

917
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,540
for they're there no that's not gonna

918
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,250
flag but if they know that I'm opening

919
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,020
it for payment and they won't know that

920
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:58,360
I may be opening that account for a

921
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,220
scammer so a lot of people disc and OH

922
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,639
that a lot of these victims that they're

923
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:05,230
working with they know that a lot of the

924
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,970
victims that they're working with have

925
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,918
decent credit have good accounts have

926
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,119
that reputation so that's why a lot of

927
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:12,819
this stuff flies under the radar like

928
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,649
that private industry has to work in

929
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,270
order to go ahead and actually identify

930
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:18,339
this stuff in that social media profile

931
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,659
that added you as a romance scammer that

932
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,280
looks like it that looks like romance

933
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:23,350
scammer did you actually report that up

934
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,850
to their social media platform or did

935
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,589
you just ignore it and go it all along

936
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,690
and even just something as simple as

937
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:30,129
reporting that one Facebook report that

938
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,899
one Facebook profile that adds that

939
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:33,129
friend request to you that's something

940
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:34,569
where you may be helping three other

941
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:35,949
people in doing that and helping through

942
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,540
other people who aren't able to see the

943
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,888
difference in that and it's something

944
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,379
where with a lot of the sharing that's

945
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:44,260
going on there needs to be more sharing

946
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:45,629
on the BC space it's something a lot of

947
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:48,220
the actors are sharing information to

948
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:49,629
and it's a lot of ways that they'll do

949
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:53,199
it is a bit like hey does they may have

950
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:55,449
a drop in North Carolina with bank name

951
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,460
here and that what they'll do is they'll

952
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,009
use locations for the scape for the

953
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:02,410
victims in order to help the transfers

954
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,550
look even more legitimate so if your so

955
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,670
for example if you're a business in

956
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:09,130
North Carolina that wires money to a an

957
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,510
account in North Carolina that is an

958
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,190
account that's been so for a while

959
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,050
there that's gonna be less likely to be

960
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,850
picked up and from a lot of those fraud

961
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:17,380
and protection pieces that we put in its

962
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,980
got completely blow by all blow by all

963
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,480
of them

964
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,040
and something where it's not just the

965
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,260
banks and everything it's all the social

966
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,550
media platforms that and all of the

967
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,050
other accounts out there too and

968
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,550
everything and all the other providers

969
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,220
is a lot of this stuff flies under the

970
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:32,980
radar just because it's legit accounts

971
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,270
being used for bad things and a lot of

972
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,589
people are like weirdly share

973
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,970
information where they actually go ahead

974
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:39,279
and engage with a lot of these things

975
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,990
well they share it in the open um take a

976
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,089
look at spammer go to Facebook take a

977
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,529
look at spammer family groups and most

978
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:47,049
of them should then shut down by now I

979
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:49,750
know that I know Krebs the whole post

980
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:53,349
that took like there's like 226 260

981
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:56,109
thousand for 202 yeah little bit about

982
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:59,079
twenty two hundred and sixty thousand

983
00:35:56,109 --> 00:36:00,520
accounts and profiles down so as

984
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:02,320
associated with a lot of people who were

985
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,940
sharing stuff back and forth and here

986
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,320
you can see that somebody needed cPanel

987
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,820
access and what they would do with that

988
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,320
is they would go ahead and use that in

989
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,530
order to upload different fishing kits

990
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,359
um they would use HTTP credentials in

991
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,190
order to go ahead and make it to where

992
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,259
as they go to a fit as they go to a

993
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,940
fishing landing pages that know bypasses

994
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,260
our IDs systems and it goes that goes

995
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,119
all the way through and everything and

996
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:24,220
account takeover so I'm gonna plays very

997
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,599
much into this and a lot of these groups

998
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:27,069
and everything not even support Knight

999
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,599
is safe from a lot of these stuff so we

1000
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:29,740
were looking at one where one of the

1001
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,710
scammers was selling for tonight

1002
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,759
accounts and everything and again you

1003
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,829
may be looking at me a little bit

1004
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,599
skeptical going really okay credential

1005
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:39,460
phishing how are you tying credential

1006
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,630
phishing back to VEC what's the

1007
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,520
relationship there there's no

1008
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,140
relationship whatsoever but it's

1009
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,970
something where I had an age and early

1010
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,440
on in my career he said Ronnie one of

1011
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,790
the things when you look at a lot of

1012
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,339
these criminals who are doing different

1013
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,940
things that criminals don't do just one

1014
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,200
type of thing

1015
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,579
well you don't someone maybe do

1016
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,560
according to me to be doing this doing

1017
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,940
this but it's never just one type of

1018
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,009
fraud that a lot of people these actors

1019
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,690
are doing so one of the actors we were

1020
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,400
looking at at the time was they were

1021
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,839
doing tax fraud they were doing

1022
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,089
credential fishing wire fraud they were

1023
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,799
doing VC's credit card fraud they were

1024
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,240
using lead generation services that most

1025
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,190
of your marketing people teams are using

1026
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,899
right now they were using invoice to

1027
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,040
write redirection or malware less attack

1028
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,319
because I had that throw at least one

1029
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,180
buzz word in here and they were doing

1030
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,220
buying RDP sessions they had a senior

1031
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,799
match account they were laundering gift

1032
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:25,839
cards on taxable calm and you can go

1033
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,910
where they can go ahead and take a gift

1034
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,380
card and convert over to Bitcoin and

1035
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,810
sell it for 70 percent of the profit

1036
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,130
they were doing check fraud and carding

1037
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,420
and they were actually monitoring credit

1038
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:37,210
on some of the accounts and everything

1039
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,680
and I had to squeeze all I had actually

1040
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,740
had to use small font in order to

1041
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,970
squeeze all of this information there

1042
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,200
again this was one account and the

1043
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,850
account that we like to call this is

1044
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,350
what I could call this scattered canary

1045
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:49,509
and what we did was we took a look at

1046
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,190
and when we was releasing the report on

1047
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:55,180
this we looked at ten years of history

1048
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:56,890
and how BC grew how one orbit how one

1049
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,950
individual grew from doing Craigslist

1050
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:01,690
scams to check products romance scams to

1051
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:03,520
w-2 fraud to BC and we have that entire

1052
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,770
timeline so I strongly encourage you

1053
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,210
guys go check out that report and just

1054
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,470
because I don't want you guys have to go

1055
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,350
through our marketing portal and

1056
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:14,140
everything do site site lagari comm file

1057
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:15,339
type PDF scatter canary and Scouter

1058
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,810
canary in quotes and there you go you'll

1059
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,360
pull the PDF right up and everything

1060
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,890
so this is a lot of really bad stuff

1061
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,150
that's been going on and I'm sitting as

1062
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,509
we're sitting here talking about it and

1063
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,670
everything

1064
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,810
so what's Nigeria's perception on this

1065
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,460
do they see this as something being

1066
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:31,920
something really bad or they are they

1067
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:35,179
more like okay whatever so here's there

1068
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,179
[Music]

1069
00:38:41,570 --> 00:39:07,590
[Music]

1070
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:26,170
[Music]

1071
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:44,460
so this is a way that a lot of them

1072
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:46,078
actually see 419 scams is it's something

1073
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,849
where the way that they justify it and

1074
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,680
the way that they see it is if I can

1075
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:51,690
trick you have a dollar that dollar is

1076
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,700
now mine and the actual the exact word

1077
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,530
that they use is Mugu and when you'll

1078
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,328
actually translate from a saw if I'm

1079
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,740
pronouncing that right it actually

1080
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,660
translates to translates to the word

1081
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,220
fool so if they're able to full and

1082
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,470
trick you out of that money they are

1083
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,480
entitled to that the other problem with

1084
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,669
that is a lot of them actually feel like

1085
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,589
when they're engaging with the victims

1086
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,359
they're actually victimizing the person

1087
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:13,680
above that they're victimizing the banks

1088
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,630
they're victimizing the corporation's

1089
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,279
they're not actually hurting people as

1090
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,270
how they see it

1091
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:20,369
however that's actually a little bit

1092
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:22,020
that's absolutely absolutely false way

1093
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:22,890
to think of that because again there's

1094
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,329
people who are committing suicide

1095
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,828
because of this stuff because they've

1096
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:28,020
actually because they've just wired all

1097
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:29,579
their money out so some people may have

1098
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,809
seen this everything because this is an

1099
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:32,640
old one this has been out for several

1100
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:34,529
years now so let's go ahead and take a

1101
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,839
look at what is modern pop culture doing

1102
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:38,369
and everything so another rapper who

1103
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,828
came out with some good songs talking

1104
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:43,500
about this stuff was a nice or I think

1105
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:45,029
it's pronounced nice I don't know but

1106
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,260
when you actually translate the lyrics I

1107
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:48,059
wouldn't be doing things I won't be

1108
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,640
controlling things yryr it's worth the

1109
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:52,049
money money order it's worth the money

1110
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,420
so that's totally a song that's not

1111
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:56,339
about wire fraud um and that was one

1112
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,349
that came out back in I think it's 2017

1113
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:00,210
when that one came out um so what's the

1114
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:01,890
more recent things that are that that

1115
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:05,039
are out there so there was another

1116
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:06,960
rapper and ir9 Ramarley and Z Latin

1117
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,839
actually came out with a with a video

1118
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,040
called a my yahoo boy so looking back at

1119
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,259
the history and what happened

1120
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,860
this he was actually doing a livestream

1121
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,150
and and in the stream he said that and

1122
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,280
he that we need to pray for the aqua

1123
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,020
boys or the Yahoo boys or the people who

1124
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,700
were doing the scam and what they call

1125
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,080
it back in Nigeria he said we need to

1126
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,460
pray for the Yahoo boys because they're

1127
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,799
the ones who were circling money for the

1128
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,960
economy and he came under fire for that

1129
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,760
and the reason that he came under fire

1130
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,040
for that because he's sitting there

1131
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,410
saying hey wire fraud good thing go keep

1132
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,360
doing it and a lot of people were upset

1133
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:41,069
with him for that and everything and on

1134
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,140
May 9th he actually released some music

1135
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:45,150
a rap video called a my yahoo boy and if

1136
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,910
you go and pull the video up it tells a

1137
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,190
story of where the efcc went and

1138
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:52,710
arrested him pulled his laptop searched

1139
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:54,960
the laptop found nothing and at the end

1140
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,250
of the video he goes back out and he

1141
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,850
goes back out as a partying with the

1142
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:02,250
people and incidentally enough the FCC

1143
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:05,940
was not pleased with that so on May 10th

1144
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:09,120
he was arrested for wait for it wire

1145
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,560
fraud so it's and it's something where

1146
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,270
people obviously are innocent until

1147
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,009
proven guilty I don't have access to the

1148
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:15,240
case and everything but seems that

1149
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,340
there's a direct correlation with

1150
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,500
rappers who are singing praises of leif

1151
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:22,830
yahoo boys and people who were actually

1152
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:25,740
doing wire fraud incidentally but on the

1153
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:28,170
counter side of that not all Nigerians

1154
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:31,140
are scammers and it's something where

1155
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,240
when 9ice released his video there was

1156
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,310
another rapper that came out and said

1157
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,770
hey we need to stop horrifying the yahoo

1158
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:39,420
boys these people are doing fraud these

1159
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:42,030
people are hurting a lot of people and

1160
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,470
we need to stop that so what he did was

1161
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,600
he came out and he's like we need to

1162
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,669
quit doing this and i will go on record

1163
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,500
and say again not all Nigerians are

1164
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:51,420
scammers a lot of them are like me in

1165
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,830
you a lot of them just want to go ahead

1166
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,390
and make the best lives they can for

1167
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,560
their family and the lot of them are

1168
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,660
good hard-working people

1169
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,970
so again contrary to popular belief not

1170
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,529
all Nigerians are scammers and when the

1171
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:03,750
youtubers I like following his name is

1172
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:05,130
Pleasant green totally check him out and

1173
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:08,150
what he'll do is he will actually go and

1174
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,150
apply to a lot of fake

1175
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:17,200
positions that are out there and he will

1176
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:18,579
actually write Korea vlog on that one of

1177
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,980
the most recent ones he did was he

1178
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:23,049
actually went and got a job sending fake

1179
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:24,490
checks and what he would do is he would

1180
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:26,288
take the fake checks he knew that if he

1181
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:28,569
print him out it was gonna be fraud so

1182
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:31,119
he went and actually in those checks he

1183
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:32,440
wrote he said hey this cheque was sent

1184
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,240
to you from a scammer whoever you were

1185
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,759
expecting this from don't give them

1186
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,058
money and interesting enough when he

1187
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:41,950
sent that out the his employer actually

1188
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:43,359
got pissed with him and he was like I

1189
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,950
know you sent this stuff and everything

1190
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,210
is like we mean did I said this stuff

1191
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,480
he's like I never did any of that and

1192
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:51,430
the scammer actually posted a picture

1193
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,369
where one of the victims sent the

1194
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:56,379
scammer a picture of the letter that

1195
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:57,849
said that it was a scammer and he's like

1196
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,470
you're now cutting into my business and

1197
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:01,299
everything and he's like you this wasn't

1198
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,129
a scam but it turned out where it was

1199
00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:05,019
and everything and it got this and

1200
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,910
everything and he quote-unquote lost his

1201
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:08,828
job and doing that and everything

1202
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,390
another interesting one that came out is

1203
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:11,589
he's been poking he's been poking a lot

1204
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,359
of these people for a pretty long time

1205
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:14,410
I've actually found his address and they

1206
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,609
end up like putting him on a couple

1207
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:17,890
mailing lists and sing him a bunch of

1208
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:21,220
like stuff a bunch of stuff as well and

1209
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:22,538
everything and he also helped and he

1210
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,519
helped an honest Kenyan try and raise

1211
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:26,380
money and what he did was he gave the

1212
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:29,439
individual a camera so go take pictures

1213
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,079
in Kenya actually it was yeah it was

1214
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,579
Kenya um and he had released a book to

1215
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,839
go ahead and help him give in legit

1216
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:37,029
reason in order to help make the money

1217
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,859
and a lot of people okay like okay why

1218
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:39,999
doesn't Nigerian law enforcement do more

1219
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:42,190
on this they need to go ahead and be

1220
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:43,689
doing more in order to stop this on the

1221
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,950
flip side they're dealing with a lot

1222
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:47,319
more problems they're dealing with

1223
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:48,730
people like Boko Haram and everything

1224
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:50,859
and when doing when doing a lot of

1225
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,289
research for this presentation one of

1226
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:55,598
the things that stuck out was a person

1227
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:57,880
who had joined Boko Haram because he was

1228
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,079
like I have my family business and they

1229
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,460
just started randomly killing people

1230
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:02,920
that was either I joined booked or Haram

1231
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,359
or they kill me ads like that's the

1232
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,489
choices some of these people have is

1233
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:08,859
literally a life or death situation in

1234
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:12,369
order to do that but on the flip side

1235
00:45:08,859 --> 00:45:13,598
actually the FCC is starting to take is

1236
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:16,210
starting to do a lot more work on this

1237
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,339
and again a lot of the Yahoo boys are

1238
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:20,319
now running which is great and there's

1239
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:21,670
been some reports coming out that a lot

1240
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,710
of them are actually fleeing to Dubai

1241
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,119
and Ghana so if anybody has law

1242
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,839
enforcement contacts in Dubai in Ghana

1243
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,839
let's get

1244
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,279
involved in this too again with a lot of

1245
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:31,119
the scammers who doing this stuff a lot

1246
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:32,380
of them are like me and you they just

1247
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,789
want to eat they wanna provide the best

1248
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,549
families they want to provide the best

1249
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:38,380
they can for the families and I was we

1250
00:45:36,549 --> 00:45:40,989
were looking at one account where that

1251
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,940
he the guy had tried to apply to college

1252
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:45,400
tried to apply for college tried to get

1253
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,140
out of Nigeria for 16 months and he

1254
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,819
spent he worked hard in order do that he

1255
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,618
was applying for visas in Canada and

1256
00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:52,569
other places whatnot and he eventually

1257
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:53,979
became a scammer because it was 16

1258
00:45:52,569 --> 00:45:56,259
months of rejection and he's like well

1259
00:45:53,979 --> 00:45:58,269
guess I go be a scammer

1260
00:45:56,259 --> 00:45:59,890
um and again it's a lot more than bad

1261
00:45:58,269 --> 00:46:01,359
people doing bad things it's just people

1262
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:03,609
who don't have a better opportunity to

1263
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,069
do better things and the other and on

1264
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:08,019
the flip side a lot of Yahoo boys are

1265
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:09,940
actually building roads and building

1266
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:11,288
casinos and Riaan and reinvesting the

1267
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,690
money back in to Nigeria

1268
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:15,430
so it's a very hard and complex problem

1269
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:17,650
for most from a socio-economical

1270
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:19,569
perspective that again they just want

1271
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,579
the best lives for their people so if

1272
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:23,920
all of us in here were in ours in those

1273
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:26,200
shoes what would we do would we be a

1274
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,390
scammer or would we each go and work 16

1275
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,589
hours busting our backs in order to make

1276
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,598
next to nothing because the average

1277
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:34,900
salary in Nigeria is three thousand US

1278
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,650
dollars per year so again where do we go

1279
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,779
from here

1280
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:40,329
we know that BC is bad and it overlaps

1281
00:46:37,779 --> 00:46:42,009
with over 9,000 types of crime and again

1282
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:43,450
it's much more than bad people doing bad

1283
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:45,279
things and it's something where we have

1284
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:46,479
to start thinking outside the box in

1285
00:46:45,279 --> 00:46:48,400
order to start addressing a lot of these

1286
00:46:46,479 --> 00:46:50,410
problems and it's something where again

1287
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,369
with how this stuff is structured and

1288
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,808
how a lot of it works

1289
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:53,619
we won't win this game alone it's

1290
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,960
something where we actually have to

1291
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:57,099
start working together and divide house

1292
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,109
will fall so we actually have to

1293
00:46:57,099 --> 00:47:01,359
collaborate and actually communicate in

1294
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:02,739
order to do a lot of this stuff there's

1295
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,930
a lot of places that we can actually

1296
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:06,849
share that information make friends with

1297

you with your local FBI field office

1299
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:11,890
actually go after a lot of these

1300
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:12,999
attackers and and it's it's not

1301
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:14,200
something where it's too bad but they're

1302
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:16,538
able to go ahead and do a lot of this

1303
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,308
stuff um file a report with I see three

1304
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:19,599
reach out to FSI Zac

1305
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:22,390

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,229
there's a TLP white slack as well where

1307
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,759

1308
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:26,140
information too and I'll go ahead I'll

1309
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,210
actually have a QR code where y'all can

1310
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,440
go ahead and hit the invite and again we

1311
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:31,059
need to start thinking differently and

1312
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,400
we need to stop being a 16 billion

1313
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:36,009
dollar statistic on this up which is

1314
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,539
where we on right now and why I say 16

1315
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:38,500
billion dollars that's not me pulling

1316
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:40,330
some random market

1317
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,220
number out of the air that's actually

1318
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:44,080
confirmed the losses with confirm the

1319
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,700
victims that are associated to that and

1320
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,350
everything so that's where we stand

1321
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,240
right now as an industry is since I

1322
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:51,040
think it's since 2013

1323
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,259
sixteen billion dollars is gone out to

1324
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,340
the door to be ECA and mathematically we

1325
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,990
know there's a lot of other things that

1326
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,390
don't get pulled into that number check

1327
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,500
fraud w2 schemes romance camps doesn't

1328
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,180
get pulled it doesn't get pulled into

1329
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,600
that so there's a lot more going on

1330
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,000
there

1331
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,380
so we need to start thinking differently

1332
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,110
and start trying to address a lot of

1333
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:10,720
stuff so with that do we have any

1334
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:12,460
questions and I will too and I've got

1335
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,810
four minutes I'm going to I'll do three

1336
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,610
minutes of questions and then the last

1337
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,170
one minute I'll go ahead and roll

1338
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:19,830
through the levels of BC really quick

1339
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,830
yes

1340
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,908
[Music]

1341
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,420
the connection so the question was

1342
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,160
what's the connection with South Africa

1343
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:43,140
for a lot of these scammers um a lot of

1344
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,029
scammers will move out of Nigeria and go

1345
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,410
to other places as well so they some of

1346
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:48,000
them may go South Africa some of what

1347
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,500
may come here to the states and it's

1348
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,170
something where a lot of them are

1349
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:56,970
Nigerians who live in other places whose

1350
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:58,790
doing a lot of stuff um oh uh yeah I

1351
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,899
[Music]

1352
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:03,300
don't have an I don't have an answer on

1353
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:10,340
the percentage unfortunately so but I

1354
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:10,340
would say a good yeah

1355
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,359
[Music]

1356
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:23,980
[Music]

1357
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,300
the question was are there other

1358
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,570
countries where this type of scams are

1359
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:30,700
coming out of I know not that I'm aware

1360
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,740
of because like I know that each country

1361
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,210
has slightly different things so like

1362
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,609
for example Russia tends to be more

1363
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:37,810
malware focus and whatnot in India you

1364
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,280
tend to have more the call centers down

1365
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,509
there Brazil you you tend to have more

1366
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,040
the banking Trojans that come out of

1367
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,210
there and everything so just really kind

1368
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,920
of a difference between where it's all

1369
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:46,510
coming from and kind of different

1370
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,550
flavors of it some people are kind of

1371
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:50,200
dabbling in other pieces and whatnot and

1372
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,690
there's more than just Nigeria dabbling

1373
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:59,680
at romance games right now

1374
00:49:51,690 --> 00:50:01,420
yeah yeah through the communications

1375
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,040
back and forth with the scammer we were

1376
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,350
able to identify it through some of our

1377
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,520
proprietary tools we were able to to use

1378
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:08,860
in order to gain a lot of visibility

1379
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,900
into that so we were able to kind of see

1380
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:13,330
that actor an actor to communication or

1381
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,470
actor to victim communication to answer

1382
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:16,000
the next question that's gonna come up

1383
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,740
for that and everything no we don't have

1384
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,090
somebody in Russia popping boxes yes we

1385
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:25,479
work with law enforcement yes we follow

1386
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:26,560
us code 18 1032 the t sorry and that was

1387
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,280
the last chair but I'll keep answer

1388
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,279
questions yeah

1389
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,589
[Music]

1390
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:46,619
so personally I'm cool with that

1391
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:48,150
and everything I go on there I mean and

1392
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:50,430
there and the reason is it well not is a

1393
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:52,229
lot of these scam when it when working

1394
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:54,930
with law enforcement the biggest problem

1395
00:50:52,229 --> 00:50:57,058
we have is the subpoena process so in

1396
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:59,549
order to get any information back on an

1397
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:02,880
email account it's 30 days to get that

1398
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:05,309
information back by that point your

1399
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,529
scammer can go and make 40 accounts in a

1400
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:09,720
day mathematically there's that's a

1401
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:11,460
problem so it takes so that's why I love

1402
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,819
those investigations take a long time to

1403
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,769
go

1404
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:20,759

00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:36,930
the stuff I have worked on but I know

1410

they're like I had to check 50 different

1458
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,740
accounts you better go back and verify

1459
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,480
every single one so at some point some

1460
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:20,790
poor sob in Nigeria went in had to do

1461
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,440
that stuff oh and turns out if you have

1462
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:25,740
if you guys do the same stuff to ariel

1463
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:28,500
thought is a good one to use on that for

1464
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,089
another good one here I can't account

1465
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,250
direct deposit information

1466
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:34,230
turns out Green Dot is a bad Bank to use

1467
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:36,330
when trying to get your accounts to go

1468
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:38,370
in and this was actually a PDF that the

1469
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:40,350
scammers had used in order to try and

1470
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:42,350
send in order to try and get the human

1471
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:45,630
resources to going back forth to them

1472
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:46,980
fastest copy paste or in the West they

1473
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:50,190
actually went and copy pasted this

1474
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,870
information to the Vic to to the during

1475
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:54,390
our engagement and they said here's the

1476
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:56,220
account in order to wire to the end up

1477
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:57,509
they accidentally gave us the tax ID the

1478
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,370
name of the person associated with the

1479
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,510
company they gave us the account number

1480
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:02,549
the user name and the password and

1481
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:05,630

1482
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,630
