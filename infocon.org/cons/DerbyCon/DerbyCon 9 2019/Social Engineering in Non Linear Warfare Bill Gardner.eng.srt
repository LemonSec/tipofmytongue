[Music]

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:15,210
okay so I should take attendance Stacy

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:19,500
you're here oh so this is a presentation

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:23,369
about nonlinear work here social

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,198
engineering using stop already social

6
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,750
engineering using nonlinear warfare I

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,550
wish I brought my readers so what we

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:36,719
have here is a it's a case study

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:39,569
basically and wife is not working anyway

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,430
I guess I'll just be a fly by the seat

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,690
of my pants because my notes aren't

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:49,160
working hi so and we have the dnc hack

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,959
so when people talk about how Russia

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,379
happy election what we're really talking

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,300
about the DNC hack and the point of this

16
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,919
presentation the point of the peer

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,260
review paper which is published I'll

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,979
give you the actual URL for that if you

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,869
want to go download it read it is that

20
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,619
when we say hack the election what is

21
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:12,659
hack the election well beyond is the

22
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:16,080
information warfare part we have this

23
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,920
actual hack of the DNC and I'm sorry for

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:25,850
those of you who hate CNN should abuse

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:31,200
Fox News I'm sorry so what we have is

26
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:34,649
the situation where a nation-state uses

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:40,820
a proxy in order to break into an asset

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:44,729
a political asset and as a result that

29
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:47,548
information was leaked back to Houston

30
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,829
for 2.0 which ended up in hands of

31
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,270
wicked leaks which didn't disseminate it

32
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:57,179
and it was actually used it was leaked

33
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,490
and it was really used know you can say

34
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,189
that it points to the election or he may

35
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,770
have not I don't think that I'm saying

36
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,889
that our current president was elected

37
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,419
because of this operation particularly

38
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,140
but we've had the information warfare

39
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,230
dating back for a year

40
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:17,049
so it's now come to the forefront so

41
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:20,109
this in this case is specifically a case

42
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:24,840
study in what happened in a specific

43
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:28,600
case so who's familiar of the Estonia

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,250
the Estonia hack where basically the

45
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,170
Russians took down the Estonians they

46
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:36,070
took down the banks they took Estonians

47
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:39,100
used online meat resources in order to

48
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:42,100
vote in West Virginia we're now looking

49
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,019
at online voting using the Estonia model

50
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,900
so when the Russians took down Estonia

51
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:51,040
banks and other critical infrastructure

52
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,959
because they move this statue to a

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,549
Russian soldier soldier which was in

54
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,980
their their City Square it's an example

55
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:04,630
of non linear warfare instead of rolling

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:09,640
tanks they used cyber I've accepted the

57
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:11,350
word cyber after 20 years cyber means in

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,880
order to take down infrastructure

59
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,420
instead of rolling tanks into their

60
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,359
country in the case issue of the

61
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,238
Georgian incursion they took down all

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,070
kinds of critical infrastructure and the

63
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,989
face websites before they ever rolled

64
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,470
the first tank so this is an example of

65
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:33,100
Russian asymmetric symmetrical warfare

66
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:35,500
so now what we have also as well in a

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,880
case of the DNC hat is social

68
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,530
engineering so who can tell me what

69
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,829
social engineering is I'm sorry I'm a

70
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:49,630
professor so when I ask questions yes

71
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:51,459
you and the black shirt exactly so it's

72
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,190
not anything new social engineering spin

73
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,989
around for a long time so social

74
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,299
engineering is this idea that you trick

75
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:01,180
people into things that they would do

76
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,799
they would not otherwise do and I'll

77
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,820
have to give a big shout out Lynch

78
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,829
without he runs a company which really

79
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,920
deals with social engineering and in

80
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,239
defeating social engineering I read a

81
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,280
book called building information

82
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,350
security awareness program which is

83
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,238
about the feeding this non-technical

84
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,940
attack on all attacks are technical

85
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:23,479
we'll get into

86
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,700
a little bit more as we go on so what is

87
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,900
social engineering well in the case of

88
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:34,340
DNC hacked John Podesta who was running

89
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:40,340
Hillary's campaign got this email which

90
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:42,400
was sort of a larger sort of phishing

91
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,669
campaign against many different

92
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,280
different sorts of people I mean as a

93
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,830
big is not specifically targeted in this

94
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,989
case it probably was targeted it's John

95
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:58,070
Podesta so he's hey you got something

96
00:04:53,990 --> 00:05:00,500
wrong with your your well thank you for

97
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,050
some water thank you very much I

98
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,860
appreciate that I like I like to stay

99
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,600
hydrated so in this case what they did

100
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,130
was and I'm this message saying hey

101
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,230
you're something off your gmail count

102
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,830
who would not want the fixer Gmail key

103
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:18,950
out right the change password they set

104
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:23,180
them this bitly link who clicks on bit

105
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:25,789
ly links everyone exactly we all click

106
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,990
on big Bentley leaves so as a result you

107
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,660
clicked on a bill he leaked and he was

108
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,520
compromised and the specific software

109
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,360
that was used in this case of malware

110
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:40,520
was fancy beer which you know you can't

111
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:43,780
have an apt attack without a logo and

112
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:48,380
also usually a song what else you need

113
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:52,900
t-shirts so clowns strike I mean cloud

114
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:56,180
strike excuse me who did the who did the

115
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,030
you know the forensics on the DNC

116
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,000
computers that it called they didn't

117
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,760
call the FBI they called prompt cloud

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm gonna get myself in trouble

119
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:10,099
CrowdStrike CrowdStrike

120
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:15,730
so I don't mean to say cloud strike we

121
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:18,410
actually have graduates there so we have

122
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,400
this situation when I use the specific a

123
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:25,100
specific type of malware in order to

124
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,919
take over DNC infrastructure and

125
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:33,180
exfiltrate data which was embarrassing

126
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:37,090
to a lot of people in DNC which was late

127
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,610
this is the I don't know if you'll

128
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:44,440
notice or not but we have this thing

129
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:47,889
called we have these intelligence

130
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,580
organizations to actually look us to

131
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,610
this stuff

132
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,460
and then you write your reports so there

133
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,960
was an intelligence report written about

134
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:02,318
this specific attack after crowd start

135
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,000
did their digital forensics and this is

136
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,069
the key judgments that came out of that

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,069
which is the Russians tried to who it's

138
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:13,960
our election also waters wet does anyone

139
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:15,789
in this room think that one country

140
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,020
would never try to influence our

141
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:24,580
elections

142
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:26,169
I know it's amazing isn't it but in this

143
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,729
case this is probably the first time the

144
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:29,818
intelligence agencies have come together

145
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:34,780
and said you know this is happening so

146
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:38,169
this is how Russia the election so what

147
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:43,679
we do moving forward that's my next talk

148
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:45,729
if you come to secure WV w WC qwv calm

149
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,800
i'll tell you about the rest of the

150
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:52,990
story SFO Harvey now so there was an

151
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,960
attention to affect the election we know

152
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,699
that blah blah blah there's a lot of

153
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,008
notes under this is apparently I can't

154
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,529
see apparently I need to print those out

155
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,750
the next time if anyone knows how to use

156
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:08,590
PowerPoint better please see me after

157
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,509
this talk thank you so the part of this

158
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:14,198
was information warfare they also found

159
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:17,289
out that the Russians had basically

160
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:21,400
troll army and I don't know if you'll

161
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:24,229
notice before chan is not your army no

162
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,060
for Chandler Cruiser in here

163
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:31,790
4chan is not your personal army right so

164
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,790
basically what they did to survive we've

165
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:38,760
wow you all need to know your history

166
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:41,219
we've actually ended up into you after

167
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:45,420
our dat in the key situation where he

168
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:47,670
was put in jail for taking he was

169
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,680
basically going to URL and not changing

170
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:53,520
numbers at the end of the URL in order

171
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,099
to see people's accounts on ATT which

172
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,280
they got thrown in jail for mr. net with

173
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,480
the technicality but where did we end up

174
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:07,310
who could tell me where weed is now

175
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,310
today no no he's in the eastern Ukraine

176
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:17,610
well he's there because he is working

177
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:19,740
for a very very rich Ukrainian who is

178
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,810
sponsoring his time they're making

179
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:27,330
trolling trolling basically he's the

180
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:29,219
king of the trolls we used to I used to

181
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,160
spend all the time studying we've no

182
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,830
idea trolling but then after

183
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,719
Charlottesville I gave up when he went

184
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,220
to troll the world poor woman who was

185
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,130
killed in Charlottesville when she was

186
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,620
run over by car I was like that's it

187
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,140
trolling still an interesting thing is

188
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:51,090
still something we do is Sam can tell

189
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:53,160
you on Facebook especially well though

190
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,710
we had this idea of information warfare

191
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,370
and this has gone on forever military

192
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,770
units have information warfare units

193
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:04,320
that go back for you for years so it's

194
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:07,050
nothing new here but they were able to

195
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:14,490
subvert things like who can tell me what

196
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:18,920
this hacker athos's are so you want to

197
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:22,170
never read Steve Levy's book on hackers

198
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,209
do yourself a favor and read more buzz

199
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,040
so one of some of the hacker ethos

200
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,970
deserts information wants to be free

201
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,969
right so the Russians have leveraged

202
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,460
this against the hacker community so

203
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,530
that they've gotten leaks you've got the

204
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,970
situation with with bradley manning now

205
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:43,560
just chelsea manning

206
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:48,900
madding who we've got anyone ever heard

207
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,910
of Julian Assange WikiLeaks right so the

208
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,439
situation here is they actually sold

209
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,780
material and they said hey look this is

210
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,420
really important we need to get to South

211
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,970
we're gonna use you hackers to get this

212
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,360
out so they've leveraged hacker group

213
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:06,620
some hacker at this in order to further

214
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,980
their their national interest

215
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,080
so Lucifer 2.0 is the person who the

216
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,360
person are persons who took credit for

217
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:20,850
this specific hack who could tell me who

218
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:24,990
goose 41.0 was no there's actually a

219
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,360
person who's been prosecuted who was the

220
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:31,620
first goose surfer but in this case this

221
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,620
is Russia it was really interesting my

222
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,420
first-year seminar class this year when

223
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,820
I had to teach two Russian Naturals

224
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,709
about the Nationals about hacking and we

225
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,440
had to talk about this stuff not I had

226
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:46,140
to preface it with first of all this is

227
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,600
nothing against you personally but we

228
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:55,170
need to talk about this so gu server 2.0

229
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:59,570
is the pro is the person who's probably

230
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:02,400
group who might you taking pictures of

231
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:08,790
is just going to end up on my personal

232
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:16,250
record the CCC you're gonna get me an

233
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:20,370
assassin a daria bye everybody

234
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,620
so gustavo 2.0 is the it's a person if

235
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,300
you lead the online articles but it's

236
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,980
actually a hacker group we're pretty

237
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,370
sure

238
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,840
so this is a hacker at those memorize it

239
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:34,920
there'll be a quiz to enter this

240
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:38,040
presentation will use quizlets in order

241
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:45,089
to do this what's the first what's the

242
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:48,079
first hacker up there anybody louder

243
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:50,520
[Applause]

244
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:55,560
thank you very much

245
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:58,730
what's the second one thank you very

246
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,579
much what is the third one

247
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:07,290
mistrust Authority right the man sucks

248
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:10,340
good exactly exactly

249
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,339
what's the third one

250
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,580
no which is wonder that which is one

251
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,430
that's what hurts me because it's not

252
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:23,370
about degrees it's not about how much

253
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:26,010
education you have most hackers are self

254
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,710
educated so I came from the 1990s where

255
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:32,250
we core to come up by having mentors

256
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:35,310
right and then we got to the point now

257
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,010
we have degrees so I hope that you all

258
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:40,079
if you're at an age where you're in

259
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,520
college you study this stuff because we

260
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,560
have degrees in this stuff now

261
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,900
so I teach of Marshall University did

262
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,670
your friends information assurance when

263
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,500
we teach people how to break into stuff

264
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,400
we don't talk about it we actually break

265
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,400
into computers with permission and write

266
00:13:53,400 --> 00:14:00,780
reports so we think we're different than

267
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:07,100
a lot of programs out there so what's

268
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:07,100
the what's the what's the next one Mike

269
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:22,170
absolutely correct we have a very

270
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:23,700
encompassing community and that we don't

271
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,280
care where you come from or what your

272
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:31,890
educational status is or what sharise's

273
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:35,209
watch your ages where you're from and

274
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:38,720
that's sort of the beauty of a community

275
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,720
what's the next one

276
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:50,089
that is correct so that's awesome so

277
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,319
there's no problem with the Russians no

278
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,170
that's fine with that

279
00:14:51,320 --> 00:15:00,380
I see we say yeah I see what you're

280
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:01,099
saying what's the last one that's

281
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,770
correct

282
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:08,810
so class computers change your all's

283
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:10,760
like for the better in my case yes it

284
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,649
has that's a whole I had degrees in

285
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:17,180
political science of journalism so I

286
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:19,370
sort of came up with hey I came up did

287
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,770
act community I have no SCP so as a

288
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:26,360
result I was able to help to teach this

289
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:28,720
in so how was this used by the Russians

290
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,860
in nantes and asymmetric warfare

291
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:37,540
specifically they used the same software

292
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:40,279
that was used to attack the the DNC in a

293
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,439
specific app it's an Android app and it

294
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:45,920
was used by the Ukrainians in order to

295
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:50,560
for artillery targeting so there's an

296
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:53,449
app out there for everything right and

297
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:59,510
the Russians were able to take over this

298
00:15:53,450 --> 00:16:01,670
application in order to figure out how

299
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,880
to destroy artillery before it was ever

300
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:07,900
fired at them and according to the

301
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,520
literature there's over nine thousand

302
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,529
incidents of this I'm sorry I had to put

303
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:17,380
over nine thousand I'm so sorry that

304
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,380
people lost their life it's a mean sorry

305
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,020
again there's some there was a major

306
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:29,480
findings in a court of clown strike I

307
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:32,170
mean CrowdStrike I'm sorry which they

308
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,520
found a number of different findings

309
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:40,399
which you can read I'm going to read

310
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:43,459
them to you so you can read all this so

311
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,730
and it actually interested ended up in

312
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:48,549
50% of loss of forces

313
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:51,879
in a case Ukrainians so why didn't we

314
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:53,858
talk about Ukraine there's been a

315
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,809
Russian incursion into Ukraine

316
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:58,709
when Ukrainians are fighting them back

317
00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:02,559
we've is in eastern Ukraine with this

318
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:04,388
trolling army which is being financed by

319
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:07,510
Russians okay I am going to

320
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:09,668
assassinations assassinated armored and

321
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,679
you've got people you know the people

322
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:14,289
who are Ukrainian trying to fight them

323
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,130
out so and we're talking about loss is

324
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:17,709
we're actually talking about the

325
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,319
Ukrainian Lawsons also fancy beer has

326
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,990
been used against their power grid so

327
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:27,699
for a number of years the powers just go

328
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:30,460
off the Ukraine completely down using

329
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,350

343
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:27,490
Elsevier also if you want to pirate my

344
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:29,500
books I don't care I know which is scary

345
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,330
because I remember ever having a talk

346
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:36,760
copy of it online anyone else having any

347
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:38,590
other questions we are looking for

348
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,279
professors at Marshall whose tenure

349
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,779
track digital forensics assistant

350
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,850
professor opening at Marshall University

351
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:50,270
you have to have master's degree

352
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:54,350
it really depends upon your background

353
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:58,930
I have master's degree in journalism and

354
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,929
undergraduate political science so

355
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:16,450
absolutely nothing nor the rest of the

356
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:16,450
federal structure as far as weed out yes

357
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:29,360
exploitation of someplace to eat right

358
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:36,460
or intimidation I understand so I

359
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:38,840
wouldn't I mean the to point and that

360
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,570
they're the one that felt for the social

361
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,230
engineering they are really at blame at

362
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:45,159
the end

363
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:50,810
I know blaming the victims not popular

364
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:53,870
but is that my blood point is that my

365
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:57,409
alcoholic point the average your okay

366
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,330
five five my five whoa blood sugar no

367
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,730
you got a point and that it's really the

368
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:04,310
DNC's fault in the end they should have

369
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,640
had an active security awareness program

370
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:09,860
which would would fix this in the

371
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:27,470
beginning if you look at most breaches

372
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:29,209
they're always social engineering that's

373
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,000
the reason this doesn't have Russia and

374
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:36,410
its name it's not it's it's an example

375
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,680
of a case study where we where it looks

376
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,690
like this is what crowd started decided

377
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,780
so therefore this is the case study the

378
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:51,150
CrowdStrike incident every point report

379
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:53,930
thank you very much awesome how much

380
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,930
time do I have left

381
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:02,760
does anyone have any questions it's hard

382
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:15,120
to see if these bright lights

383
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:17,460
I'm kidding yes sir well that's yeah

384
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,739
that's a question is that I talked to

385
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,890
somebody who's in US military what you

386
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:26,130
just leaned on a asymmetric warfare

387
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,620
exercise so we're practicing for this in

388
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:33,510
the United States and with our allies as

389
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:37,129
well so yeah I mean this is the new

390
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:39,780
hotness if you don't lose light and

391
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:41,460
prosper skating work or before you can

392
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,310
roll tanks or you send it

393
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,470
aircraft why would you not take down the

394
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:48,389
air defenses and we did this we did this

395
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,280
in Iraq I mean if we want to talk about

396
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,910
the Russians you know we they did this

397
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,310
the Syst

398
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:56,520
in Iraq we did similar things we took

399
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:58,950
down air defenses by sending out special

400
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,160
hewlett-packard updates to their

401
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,170
printers then pivoted from the printers

402
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,860
in order to take down to things like air

403
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:10,530
defense radar etc so it's on both sides

404
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:20,219
it's not just one country that's

405
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:22,800
interested in this this is just a case

406
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,960
study I bet we can do a case study as

407
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,960
well on the u.s. doing the same thing

408
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:33,540
it's a brave new world

409
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:36,229
he had a questions yes sir yes you and

410
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,230
the blue shirt

411
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:49,470
take on the neutral vectors that's a

412
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,658
that's a hard one because each class is

413
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,730
about anonymous and WikiLeaks and like

414
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:57,960
you know what they were doing and now

415
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:59,789
I've got to the point where they're you

416
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,059
can almost look at WikiLeaks is a

417
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:07,730
non-state actor I mean they're they're

418
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:10,620
actually WikiLeaks as it exists now

419
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:12,330
an anonymous as it exists now because

420
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,928
it's not the same I mean this is not

421
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,389
summer law SEC this is a different time

422
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:20,190
they said they've sort of gone out of

423
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:25,049
favor but I understand what you're

424
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:27,330
saying they they almost became NGO they

425
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:30,990
became a non-governmental environment a

426
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:34,110
got a non-governmental organisation that

427
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:38,480
was affecting foreign policy so does

428
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,479
Julian Assange needs to be arrested

429
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:45,260
maybe information wants to be free but

430
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:48,600
at what cost

431
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,129
unfortunately and if you're looking at

432
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,860
it from the hacker community we believe

433
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:56,280
information should be free but you

434
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:58,080
couldn't effects nation-states they're

435
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:02,570
going to stand up because they're saying

436
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,570
you know you're affecting our specific

437
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,678
puts word I'm looking for

438
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,020
yeah exactly you're our mission or

439
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:23,070
whatever are our goals are as the

440
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:24,240
nation-state so right yeah so indicates

441
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,668
the WikiLeaks they do believe

442
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,419
information should be free Assange does

443
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:35,190
have that hacker at those but there's a

444
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:37,559
limit unfortunately then nineties we ran

445
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:41,260
up against the don't tell me stop I'll

446
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:47,570
give you the single finger salute

447
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:50,809
so there's a point where I don't know I

448
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:54,408
mean I'm from the hacker community I'm a

449
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:56,418
hacker at those and the information

450
00:24:54,409 --> 00:25:02,710
needs to be free the dura limitations to

451
00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:06,070
that thank you all very much and thank

452
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,070
