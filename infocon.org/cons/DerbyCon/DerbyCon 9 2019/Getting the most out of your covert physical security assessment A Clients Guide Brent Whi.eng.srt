1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,758
hello got way too quiet yes you know I

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,269
have to be quiet we're not saying

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,740
anything important so it's okay this is

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,610
getting the most out of your physical

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:19,198
security assessment a clients guide so

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:21,419
who are we burnt white and so we have a

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,369
personal blog too and you see from our

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,529
shirts we have people this is where we

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,660
talk about our physical intrusion in

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,750
social engineering tactics and

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,610
techniques and experiences that we have

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,739
also things like hotel hacking things

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,230
like that so so if you ever want to see

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,800
the slide deck this is very post-its and

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,648
some of our other talks so the whole

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,629
point of this talk is we do a lot of

17
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,340
physical intrusion and assessments

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,960
physical security assessments and we've

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,899
seen common problems with different

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,120
clients with a misunderstanding of what

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,219
they need what the what they think they

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,690
might need what they don't realize that

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,510
they need and so we're just going to

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,690
quickly go over there are three main

25
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,020
types of physical assessments that we do

26
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,640
and that looks kind of small to can

27
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,539
anybody not read that at the bottom no

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,770
it's kind of small all right so one of

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,750
the first ones that we do is a covert

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,580
assessment this is what we primarily do

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,670
and what methodology that we're in

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,920
charge of for our security team this is

33
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,890
an emphasis on real-world attack vectors

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,759
this includes social engineering

35
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,049
oftentimes when you're doing a physical

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,640
security assessment you're talking with

37
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,810
the client the client is not aware the

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,180
social engineering is part of that

39
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,860
assessment this is primarily for the

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,869
covert stuff we also do some overt

41
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,750
physical security assessments this is

42
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,820
where we go with the clients as we walk

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,090
yes I appreciate the gift here for a

44
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,600
moment but we will walk with the clients

45
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,759
side by side it's a lot of Q&A asking

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,949
about instant response asking about how

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,689
their cameras are hooked up who's

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,210
monitoring things like that the kind of

49
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,298
devices and access controls that they

50
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,070
have installed and so to kind of add on

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,290
to that with these physical slice side

52
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,590
assessments as we're going through we

53
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,260
can really kind of dig deep into things

54
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,599
like alarm sensor placements how easy is

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,640
it to bypass these we can look at things

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,179
like door configurations window

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,519
configurations even start to look into

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,410
documentation on how do you handle

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,569
employees that have lost their badges

60
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:33,390
how do you handle guests and so on so

61
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:35,458
this picture is actually I took this on

62
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,329
a physical assessment that I've done

63
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:43,319
recently and yet to the clients defense

64
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:46,319
it was decommissioned also before it was

65
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,060
decommissioned it was a working camera

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,129
that someone thought it was good to

67
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,200
actually install it this way yeah so how

68
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:59,370
do you the slack on that cable is what

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:04,170
gets me is reaching up their brain can't

70
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,879
reach it yeah sorry anyway so part of

71
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,030
this - when we do these kinds of

72
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,120
assessments the covert oftentimes we

73
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,150
focus on getting from A to B a specific

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,909
area either the data center or executive

75
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,879
suite and office but this is something

76
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:22,409
the client provides so this is two big

77
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,018
differences between the covert and overt

78
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:26,310
is that the over it is focused on things

79
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,870
like that so if you see something like

80
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,670
that then you're able to say hey look at

81
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,230
that or hey look at this have you

82
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,879
considered this or what are you doing

83
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,159
why is that up there is it even

84
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,349
functional these kinds of questions are

85
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,000
great for those over types of

86
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:42,000
assessments but the covert is more of

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,650
again a criminal mindset getting from A

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,489
to B and how we can get there as quickly

89
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,950
as possible

90
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:51,120
either tailgating or cloning a badge or

91
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,589
something yeah so red teaming and red

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,840
teaming it's where you take all these

93
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,489
different types of attacks you take the

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,879
covert part of the assessment you also

95
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:03,000
include things like fishing fishing

96
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,909
external penetration assessments all

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,530
these different things where depending

98
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,019
on the client and we'll get into this a

99
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,629
little bit more but depending on the

100
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,540
client your industry your location

101
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:19,159
what things make sense to include in a

102
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,409
red team or does it make more sense to

103
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,080
you know focus on different things dear

104
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,970
in a covert assessment and so that's

105
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,380
mostly what we're sort of getting at

106
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,060
here and we've mentioned this in some of

107
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,920
our other talks to the red team is

108
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,320
subjective often times in this industry

109
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,450
you know purple team all that stuff is

110
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,620
kind of dependent on whoever's

111
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:43,460
performing the assessment that

112
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:44,870
understanding yes what's that absolutely

113
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,250
it does boil down to the scope and even

114
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,470
when you're doing like pre-sales and

115
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,180
you're talking with your client or

116
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,280
whatever developing that statement of

117
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,540
work getting a clear understanding of

118
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,460
what a red team is because sometimes

119
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,680
we'll have a client come in and be like

120
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,120
hey we want a red team assessment okay

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,290
cool and then we talk with them and all

122
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,570
they want is a wireless security

123
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,850
assessment and a web app or a web app

124
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,010
assessment it's like this is this is

125
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,570
more of a the whole thing right the

126
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,400
whole gambit or different attack vectors

127
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,950
that are combined and it's usually a

128
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,500
longer engagement type it's not just one

129
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:20,840
week or two weeks or something yeah yeah

130
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,610
who in here does pin testing okay so I'm

131
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,140
sure you you all have probably ran into

132
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,000
scenarios where people like hey I heard

133
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,000
this really cool buzzword at RSA called

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,770
red team I want that they're like okay

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,720
well here's all this stuff here's the

136
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,630
budget for it and like oh no we just you

137
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,490
know we have two Web Apps and we want

138
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,860
you to look at you know our Amazon

139
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,600
instance or something so for our red

140
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,980
teaming to house this kind of ties into

141
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,780
what we were talking about with physical

142
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,090
security that's one of the attack

143
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,890
vectors so will attempt to do you know

144
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,539
things from external perspective

145
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,719
gathering those since doing all that

146
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,430
that recon and such before doing an

147
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,260
on-site because will exhaust all those

148
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,730
efforts see if we can get access that

149
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,730
way and if not and we'll try to send

150
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,669
somebody and to drop a Dropbox or

151
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,900
connect an access point to remote in or

152
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:08,870
even do it wirelessly from the parking

153
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:12,380
lot yeah we could probably go on about

154
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,370
red teaming oh yeah oh and something

155
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,320
else to you probably shouldn't mention

156
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,690
this seven minutes ago if anybody has

157
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,050
questions or anything please ask us as

158
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:24,110
we're going also if you feel like

159
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,759
heckling us - that's cool so yeah

160
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:46,669
question

161
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:48,830
that's fine so the question how hard is

162
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:51,169
it to sell a covert assessment as

163
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,318
opposed to just a physical sight

164
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:55,758
assessment with the walkthrough correct

165
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,990
and that's kind of what we're we're

166
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,159
going to dig into that a little bit

167
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,960
hopefully not

168
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:02,930
not as in-depth as we want because of

169
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,698
the time restraint but there are there

170
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,129
are different questions you that you can

171
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,960
pose to them that in a quick response to

172
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,339
that to is like doing hybrid type of

173
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,779
security assessments where you go in

174
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:13,279
covertly at first and then once you're

175
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:15,409
done whether or not they catch you or

176
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,779
whether you've obtained access then do a

177
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:19,370
walk through that half so your level of

178
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,409
effort may increase a little bit but

179
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,759
it's still it's still you know they're

180
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:34,969
kind of getting the best of those worlds

181
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:38,180
with that approach yep yeah so have we

182
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:39,979
ran into two issues with results from

183
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,469
physical versus other parts of the

184
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,479
company like cyber and so on oh yeah and

185
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:46,430
that's one of the things where three of

186
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,930
these assessments we say this is why

187
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,449
it's important yeah you might have these

188
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,430
things locked down but if anyone can

189
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:54,169
walk in off the street and pull your

190
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,999
server rack out and go out the front

191
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:58,279
door with it that's a breach that's a

192
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:59,959
problem so then also and I say this I

193
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,729
think in every talk you look at any of

194
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,409
our talks but security awareness

195
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,359
training to doesn't blow it down to just

196
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:07,009
that kind of annual thing that you do or

197
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,680
quarterly training that you take online

198
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:11,149
or whatever it has to be that that

199
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,649
culture to and so one of the things that

200
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:13,939
we'd like to test Fri merrily with our

201
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:16,339
physical security assessments is

202
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:18,439
security awareness training covertly

203
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:19,789
assessments as a security awareness

204
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,349
training whether or not they are

205
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:25,009
escalating properly and we'll get into

206
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:26,990
this a little bit in our next slides so

207
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:28,999
yeah problems that we notice I don't

208
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,689
know what I want clients often aren't

209
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:33,069
aware of options that they need so again

210
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,719
some of those options and just like he

211
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:36,128
was saying sometimes a client just has

212
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,319
one idea of what a physical security

213
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:39,729
assessment is like oh okay well you're

214
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:42,128
going to walk through and tell us where

215
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,290
camera placement is or what kind of

216
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:46,720
badge access we have or the incident

217
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,089
response systems that we have utilized

218
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,279
and it's it can be more than that and I

219
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,370
think it's very important as we go into

220
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,709
this next slide to assess these risk so

221
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,420
for your question earlier candidate dig

222
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:00,699
into that when you're talking to a

223
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,128
client about a physical assessment you

224
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:05,170
know what are their risks like I guess

225
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:07,810
in a way that we like to ask it is what

226
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,579
keeps you up at night and so by asking

227
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,489
that question you can start to get some

228
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:14,138
some you know legitimate answers from

229
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,230
them about what they really worry about

230
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:19,449
so depending on the industry is that our

231
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,430
insider threats you know you're looking

232
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:24,389
at intellectual property that you're

233
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:27,660
protecting or outsider you know or

234
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:31,269
terroristic and so on so it depends on

235
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,740
what your what your main risks are and

236
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,449
with that that'll also shape your guys

237
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,800
so as a pen tester if you're doing

238
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,779
offering these kinds of service

239
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,979
offerings whether they're on site social

240
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,620
engineering or physical security

241
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,180
assessments is is understanding what

242
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,939
kind of guys is more appropriate and

243
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,800
understanding the industry and and

244
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:50,079
testing that because if I'm wanting to

245
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,240
get an idea of what an employee has

246
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,680
access to or whatever then you know if

247
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,389
I'm gonna pretend to be an employee

248
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,638
rather than trying to be you know the

249
00:09:55,389 --> 00:10:00,269
cleaning crew or some contractor there

250
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,920
to fix the printer or whatever and so

251
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:05,279
something that Tim was talking about

252
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,290
earlier before we came in here is that

253
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,360
for example with retail you know they

254
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,879
have a higher risk of insider threats

255
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,009
with employees stealing property things

256
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,509
like that

257
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:19,089
so just you know again it depends on

258
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:20,410
your industry yeah so as a client how

259
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:23,740
many people in here are clients that

260
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:26,920
hire pin testers there's like three

261
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,449
that's good well know as a client I

262
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,009
think even understanding that two before

263
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:32,349
you go in be prepared to have those

264
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:35,920
conversations with the pen tester to

265
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,509
adequately request the services that you

266
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,849
are looking for have an understanding

267
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:41,350
even like researching when you're doing

268
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,880
a request from a bid or whatever if you

269
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,640
have multiple security companies that

270
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,620
you're kind of looking

271
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,660
see what service offerings they have ask

272
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,250
to see their methodology hey can you

273
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,839
guys send me a methodology overview con

274
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,579
so I can kind of see what your approach

275
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,560
is for these types of assessments so we

276
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,630
can kind of look at what exactly we were

277
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,420
looking for you know so if you're a

278
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,189
federal facility to add on to that and

279
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,019
let's say maybe you're a nuclear

280
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,630
facility with you know high security

281
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:07,850
you're going to want to look at a pen

282
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,339
test company that in their methodology

283
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,079
they include things like surveillance

284
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,300
and that they're not just going to show

285
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,579
up for half a day and see if they can

286
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,969
just walk in the front door you know you

287
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:23,300
want a company that has that maturity

288
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:26,800
and the experience where they can assess

289
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,269
and properly look at things for

290
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,670
facilities like a nuclear facility and

291
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:33,769
so on a key area of concerns as well

292
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,170
we've had some financial Institute's

293
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:38,750
that we do assessments for and they'll

294
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,060
be in really high crime rate areas so

295
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,589
keeping in mind that to where your

296
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,540
facility is located

297
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:45,709
are they downtown somewhere where

298
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,430
there's a lot of crime a lot of

299
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:51,229
break-ins a lot of car theft even so I

300
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,939
think we did an assessment for a client

301
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,220
a couple years ago where they had had a

302
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,690
few car theft incidents so they just

303
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,000
didn't even have camera coverage in

304
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,920
their parking garage but in the the arm

305
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,140
was broken so it was up all the time so

306
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,790
yeah there's reasons for this but you

307
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,680
know I think it's good to have these

308
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,750
kind especially the covert stuff to say

309
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,519
hey look we just pretended to be

310
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,350
criminals criminals could have done this

311
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,779
and we just saved you a potential

312
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,209
compromise yeah and that was also the

313
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:19,730
one there was a ATM vestibule right

314
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:21,619
across the street and there had been a

315
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:24,380
shooting there like a month before we

316
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,750
had showed up so if you are doing pen

317
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,880
tests like physical pen tests and you go

318
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,160
to certain areas you also want to know

319
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,660
what's the crime rate in that area so

320
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,189
you're not you know walking around by

321
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,930
yourself at midnight and go down the

322
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,000
wrong alley or something something else

323
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,640
just because a slide mentions it you

324
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,040
know oftentimes the the power the

325
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,329
generators on the outside there they are

326
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,219
not protected they're just kind of

327
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:48,949
sitting there these are things to

328
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,720
consider too especially you know if your

329
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,939
risk is some kind of terroristic threat

330
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,890
or you know say you're a credit card

331
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,000
debt collection company or whatever you

332
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,680
know

333
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,970
the if you're just leaving the

334
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,620
generators there and that's powering

335
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,509
your datacenter you don't have some kind

336
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,069
of backup generator or those are your

337
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:07,850
backup generators then they could be bad

338
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:10,639
news yeah and you had a question earlier

339
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:14,060
right no I thought you raising yeah yeah

340
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,120
oh okay sorry there were an option you

341
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:30,319
would have bought it so yeah you have a

342
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:31,399
question absolutely actually we talked

343
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:33,589
to a guy think it might've been a Def

344
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,810
Con this guy does a lot of drone hacking

345
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:37,879
and so one of the things is the design

346
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,849
of the building and the metal plates on

347
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,379
the ceiling having a you know tinted

348
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,449
windows and stuff from the outside

349
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:46,339
things like that because I mean those

350
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:49,040
are real threats especially with the

351
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:51,500
size of drones now Mavic has tons of

352
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,120
tiny little drones that record like in

353
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,519
very high definition and night-vision

354
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,410
and all that stuff so these are actual

355
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,089
actual things that you know I think a

356
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,160
lot of people don't consider and it's

357
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:03,139
kind of fairly new it's not too new but

358
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,459
it's still new enough that clients

359
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:07,220
oftentimes don't even consider that kind

360
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:09,859
of thing now in again if it's a bank or

361
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,079
somewhere that needs to be more secure

362
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,899
you also want to make sure that you have

363
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,579
the proper physical barriers in front to

364
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,779
prevent a car from driving through the

365
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:22,008
front door or trying to rip out an ATM

366
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:23,899
also with cameras you want to make sure

367
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,939
they're proper placement high enough

368
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:29,689
resolution so that it can actually be

369
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:32,360
used and as evidence if needed so yeah

370
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:34,550
your incident response to like your

371
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,410
incident your intrusion detection like

372
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,540
what do you have in place for that a lot

373
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,750
of times we'll do like group forcing on

374
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:44,329
badge readers and most of the time too

375
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,040
I'll go up and I'll still a badge or

376
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:49,069
clone a badge get close enough and then

377
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,750
Brent will clone that badge off of my

378
00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:52,729
clone off of my proxmark

379
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,980
and then we're using the same badge to

380
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,629
get into multiple facilities or using

381
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,699
the same badge one right after the other

382
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,769
to get access to a building because

383
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:01,160
we've we've cloned a badge or duplicated

384
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:04,220
a badge

385
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,509
sometimes the security and the clients

386
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,209
aren't monitoring that so they're not

387
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:09,000
seeing hey man this same same dude John

388
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,339
Doe is

389
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,380
badge in here and he also badged into

390
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,170
the data facility across town or in

391
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,270
another state 30 seconds ago yeah so

392
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,459
those kinds of things I think tweaking

393
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,310
it a lot of those monitoring systems

394
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,190
have had those kinds of options yeah and

395
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,050
so with the security guards for more

396
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,020
more info on that we have a talk called

397
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,520
security guards LOL where and that

398
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,640
sounds immature browser should rethought

399
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,800
the title of that but basically it's

400
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,140
where we point out the issues of large

401
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,439
corporations their physical security

402
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:45,689
relies largely on one or two security

403
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,790
guards so there have been times where

404
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,560
you were talked about you know we clone

405
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,140
a badge and then we share the cloned

406
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,510
badge and our batch cloners are hidden

407
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,699
in like a coffee cup or a muffin bag or

408
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,560
something and we don't take it out we

409
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,600
just hold the cup or the bag up to the

410
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,969
badge reader and it's like oh Bob Smith

411
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,950
just badged in three times in the

412
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,420
security guard through the window right

413
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,920
next to us doesn't even notice because

414
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,790
he's like watching basketball or

415
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,620
something on his phone

416
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,150
yeah oftentimes security guards are very

417
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,010
distracted especially because if nothing

418
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,600
happens you know or that's the the

419
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,040
mentality they get into so they're

420
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,750
sitting there on on these things

421
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,599
watching Netflix or distracted or

422
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,640
whatever and then also the opposite can

423
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,440
happen too so that's something that we

424
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,270
want to always prevent but we have

425
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,610
actually we made these shirts as a joke

426
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,770
because often times we'll be there and

427
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,750
we'll get to from point A to B or we'll

428
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:36,030
get to our destination or get access to

429
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,470
an area and then after that we're like

430
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,689
well what else we do well let's put

431
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,210
these shirts on and walk around it says

432
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,220
anything so you know I'm not supposed to

433
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,220
be here and that's why we had these

434
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,370
shirts man yeah people don't pay it did

435
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,870
you people laugh most the time they

436
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,180
don't even they just don't pay attention

437
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,430
we have somebody actually recognizes one

438
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,510
time to friend we won't deviate too much

439
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,180
because we only got a few more minutes

440
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,220
but we were doing an assessment he's

441
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,599
like hey I saw girls talk on breaking

442
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,450
into a building at hackers guy don't

443
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,060
authorize access wait a minute are you

444
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,319
guys here doing a physical security

445
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,329
assessment and this was after we had

446
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,699
just tailgated him into the data center

447
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,740
area but it was this guy because there

448
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:20,100
was a retina scanner and Tim was right

449
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,199
behind the guy and so he put this badge

450
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,579
up that was blank and it beeped anyway

451
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,169
because it does whether it's I went

452
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,759
through the motions and stuff and he put

453
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,929
his eye down to the retina scanner and

454
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:31,590
the guy was like oh you don't have to do

455
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:34,470
that it's not plugged up yeah he was

456
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,759
like wait a minute no but it was funny

457
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,320
because the entire time we were in there

458
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,279
too because we're he was like oh are you

459
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,960
guys doing this that's more like

460
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:41,639
actually yeah we're here meeting with

461
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,200
the CSO he's supposed to be over here we

462
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:44,370
just had lunch with him he's gonna meet

463
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,379
us over here is there a place we can

464
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,120
wait and he's like I'm gonna be watching

465
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:50,158
you guys and he you know the whole time

466
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,360
he just walks away and we're just

467
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:53,009
sitting there we plug into the

468
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,199
conference room it's into the conference

469
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:57,000
room DHCP is enable we get an IP address

470
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,259
and we start some scans just to grab

471
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,179
some proof of concept because it was

472
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:02,460
just a physical thing and then and then

473
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,799
we left yeah it's like a whole time he

474
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,809
was like watching you this is like yeah

475
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:13,440
we see you there so and with what should

476
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:15,809
I have tested so yeah understanding what

477
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,309
you need and not being too scared of

478
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:19,769
what a pen tester might find if you

479
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:23,668
really pigeonhole and like lock it down

480
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:25,529
you're only setting yourself back so the

481
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,629
point of this is to see what

482
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:30,389
vulnerabilities are there what ways

483
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:33,299
could a malicious actor really leverage

484
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:37,620
these vulnerabilities and and make you

485
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:39,960
have a really bad day so yeah after

486
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,250
hours testing you know tell is that

487
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,320
something you want to look at this is

488
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,639
something to consider even as pen

489
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,340
testers this is something really to

490
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:50,309
consider as we kind of go to this next

491
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,139
one here I'll shoot you there are some

492
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,759
security guards out there that are that

493
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:55,918
have an itchy trigger finger bands

494
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,220
especially if you're doing after-hours

495
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,720
assessments so we no joke had a client

496
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,220
once he was signing our letter of

497
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,379
authorization or aka

498
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,559
get-out-of-jail-free card he was signing

499
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:09,919
it and he said don't get shot we're like

500
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:12,680
what wait a minute what

501
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,060
wait let me call my wife yeah he didn't

502
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,160
tell us that they had armed security

503
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,510
guards too so that changed a lot we were

504
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,660
like we're not doing this after hours

505
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:23,510
you know especially with a disclaimer

506
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:31,550
don't get shot okay you should never be

507
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:35,360
a concern as a pen tester yes that's one

508
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:39,110
of them yeah yeah that's seriously one

509
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,300
so after an assessment it was a evening

510
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,850
assessment and we were doing the report

511
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,940
readout and the statement was made by a

512
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:50,899
security guard if I had seen you I would

513
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,400
have fired at you and this was like it

514
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,020
wasn't saying I would have challenged

515
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,310
you seeing what you were doing if I

516
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,190
would have seen you I would have fired

517
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:00,020
at you and at that point it's like no

518
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,490
After Hours assessments with armed

519
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,910
guards you know I think that's probably

520
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:07,130
safe but yet you know so we got a lot

521
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,140
more minutes so we'll hold off on

522
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:13,010
questions till the end as we kind of

523
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:16,160
rush to these last remaining slides so a

524
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,810
lot of times clients will ask us okay as

525
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,790
you gain access or as you're interacting

526
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,460
with employees we know you have like

527
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:24,560
that the cameras and your ink pens and

528
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,080
all that stuff can you can you use that

529
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,399
and show it show us later and that's a

530
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,639
really cool idea and it can be useful

531
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,500
but you really really have to check with

532
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,950
your local laws you know I'm not a

533
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,990
lawyer

534
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,070
I don't think Tim's a lawyer so we can't

535
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,580
tell you yes or no

536
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:43,010
but yeah not today but ask a lawyer to

537
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,740
make sure that you're not breaking any

538
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:47,930
state or federal laws with with these

539
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,730
surveillance things like this so and as

540
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,830
a client to make sure you're not just

541
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:53,540
doing this just for the checkbox you

542
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,909
know these kinds of assessments any pin

543
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,470
test should not be checkbox compliant

544
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,700
driven I mean yeah that may be a

545
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,740
requirement that shouldn't be your

546
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,100
driving factor but just a starting point

547
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,660
yeah yeah so again things to consider

548
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,969
what's your what's your biggest concern

549
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,250
what's your biggest fear what keeps you

550
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,900
up at night so depending on your

551
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,340
industry again these are things that you

552
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,710
should consider more and unfortunately I

553
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,230
wish that we had more time to go more in

554
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,200
depth

555
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,000
on that yeah this is also why we you

556
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
know go to week hack people calm and you

557
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,730
can check out some of our other talks

558
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,650
where we get a little bit more verbose a

559
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,570
little more in-depth this is very hot

560
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,309
level if you guys have any questions I

561
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,600
think we have like two more minutes so I

562
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:36,809
think Jim you had a you had a question

563
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:40,949
back there if we encounter guard animals

564
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:42,389
I never had well if you do surveillance

565
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,460
and you do see that haven't had the

566
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,200
issue come up with that yet but there

567
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,730
are tactics around that where you can

568
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,960
distract those depending on their

569
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:54,960
training or the area but at all costs I

570
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,280
would advise not having to enter again

571
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,580
it's it's it's kind of one of those in

572
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,070
predictable deterrence right that

573
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,439
especially like guard dogs so I wouldn't

574
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:07,559
risk any of my team to go and do that

575
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,820
just because it's too great a risk so

576
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,799
even as a client you know you're looking

577
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,149
at your risk right but as a pen tester

578
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,740
look at your risk as well yeah and

579
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,840
somebody might say well throw the dog a

580
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,790
stake but if there's some sort of

581
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,740
dietary restriction or something where

582
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,110
you that could harm the animal now

583
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,309
you've got a lawsuit just just stay away

584
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,309
if I can leave shrimp

585
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,520
yeah yeah the property management so

586
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:33,900
that's that's something that we actually

587
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,790
run into especially with the red teaming

588
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,799
and Marla's stuff we that's where

589
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,580
partial disclosure kind of comes in so

590
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,010
when you're talking with a client

591
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,510
letting them as well as a client

592
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,059
letting the pin tester know hey these

593
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,150
are our rooms these are sweets this is

594
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:52,320
our here's a list of our access points

595
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:54,500
you know that way you're Europe what's

596
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,500
that

597
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,399
yes yeah they have to yeah and sometimes

598
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,309
it will even use a property manager as a

599
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,570
guys one of the times I always pretend

600
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:05,070
to be a property manager I had a letter

601
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,510
that I'd written out gave it to one of

602
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:08,340
our team members he pretended to be

603
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,260
there to replace the sprinkler heads on

604
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,750
the property he brought a ladder

605
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,340
carrying a louder ladder around got in

606
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,380
there installed a wireless access point

607
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,850
in the conference room and we were able

608
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,280
to connect from the outside but from

609
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,330
that you know that's another concern too

610
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,980
when you're putting these rogue access

611
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,470
points or evil access points and you

612
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,929
have a shared facility not only is that

613
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,490
trying to get people lined within the

614
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:29,910
scope but it's also increasing that so

615
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,010
you have to

616
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,360
limit these things and tweak it but if

617
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,830
it's a property management sometimes you

618
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,419
can even get them to buy in for the

619
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,909
whole facility and then in gain some

620
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:44,810
more clients that way - yeah good

621
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:44,810
question any more questions yep

622
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,740
regular sedan just normal vehicle you

623
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,199
don't want anything like bright colors

624
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,780
or you know some fancy Camaro that you

625
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,300
got from enterprise the most boring like

626
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,040
mundane everyday vehicle to vehicles

627
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,149
yeah get two of them as well if you run

628
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,220
if you're gonna be doing surveillance

629
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:04,170
for a longer extended period of time

630
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,600
though you can switch out but yeah the

631
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,880
most boring thing you can get yeah and

632
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,530
also if you're looking at really high

633
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,000
traffic areas and stuff like that so

634
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,100
it's a little bit easier to blend in

635
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,570
that way but you can even do some recon

636
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,159
beforehand look at the vehicles in the

637
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:21,270
parking lot some common vehicles or a

638
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,740
rickshaw you know alright guys I think

639
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,090
we've reached our time but we appreciate

640
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,790

[Applause]
