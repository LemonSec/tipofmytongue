1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
1995 server profile broken trust models

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,898
not not just for ssl anymore

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,269
where we'll be examining the methods of

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,849
identification used by social media and

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,910
internet companies and how by abusing

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:17,369
two points they can be used to create

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,130
untrustable or anonymous profiles and

8
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,980
just keep understanding the quotes

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,259
because the different methodology could

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,640
be tracked by the right government

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,520
agency or company first introduction to

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,920
from a small-time boutique company to

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,710
the corporate world legal disclaimers at

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,600
its core this talk is just talking about

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,340
the system that is there are no exploits

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,079
of vulnerabilities being disclosed the

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,930
company's mentions are not doing

18
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,700
anything wrong or insecurely to give you

19
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,710
a background on how I started getting

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,629
involved in creating anonymous profiles

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,100
and untraceable accounts is by work by

22
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,320
working with people that have been

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,969
abused abuse women people that word had

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,760
orders protections people that needed to

25
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:07,320
hide I work with different groups and

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,380
providing suggestions on how they could

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,850
get these covert or secondary channels

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,259
of communication with their families

29
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,960
during these times and that's how I

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,850
first got involved with doing this type

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,639
of stuff yeah I know it's kind of

32
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,470
shocking that you can actually get asked

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,090
to do something in IT security other

34
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,570
than break into a girlfriend's computer

35
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,450
an email account when things go south

36
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:32,880
all right Who am I up here not really

37
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,500
that important but contact details what

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,329
I really want to be is a part-time

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:42,390
farmer but just no money in it okay with

40
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,029
this talk we can take over the world not

41
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,290
really but we will be able to remove a

42
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,770
little excuse me build members here all

43
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,579
right we will be able to remove a little

44
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:58,380
arbitrate air I apologize not usually

45
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,148
standing in the room we're breaking in

46
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,009
but what we're looking to do is remove a

47
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,040
little out of station between ourselves

48
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,960
and the targets mostly when the

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,920
statesman's goes south or if an

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,690
engagement calls for

51
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:15,390
engaging in the blue team of the red

52
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:17,859
team how can we remove these secondary

53
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,619
associations between ourselves and these

54
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,530
customers this is actually a 25-minute

55
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,330
version of a 45-minute talk I did so I

56
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,700
had to cut out some of the social media

57
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:32,290
stuff to focus on the more interesting

58
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:34,239
things all right so let's just do start

59
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,730
out with a basic understanding of how

60
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,680
things are currently done in the

61
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,660
advanced engagements you have domain

62
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,959
fronting purchase of expired domains

63
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,730
maybe dynamic DNS services proxy in C to

64
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,760
traffic redirection you know fake

65
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,840
identities of onus all of this stuff is

66
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,239
good stuff

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,980
of course there's things like domain

68
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,560
privacy which is a really a short time

69
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,299
delay for certain targets a victim of a

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,690
cyber attack can contact a domain

71
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,690
provider and get that privacy pierced

72
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:11,350
sorry but there's one thing that's

73
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,510
missing in all of this in short the

74
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,359
industry currently focuses on hiding the

75
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:20,290
interactive c2 infrastructure but not

76
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,510
that's not the how the services are

77
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,840
bought and who owns that infrastructure

78
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,760
that we pay for them in this talk look

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,910
so you address that so why are all the

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,798
trouble of creating a physical profiles

81
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,209
since we all start with different points

82
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,269
of knowledge and understanding I'm just

83
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,670
going to cover a few basic things first

84
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:42,549
as security companies we currently look

85
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:46,059
to remove as station from our accounts

86
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:47,530
with onus and the targets normally we

87
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,370
don't need to worry about the secondary

88
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,079
associations our metadata or having our

89
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,079
infrastructure accounts privacy pierced

90
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,880
but what if the target is law

91
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,180
enforcement what if it's a government

92
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:04,630
agency what are what if you are a dark

93
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,940
web hunter or you know you work hunting

94
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,709
down criminal organizations and again

95
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,829
what if your purpose is to protect the

96
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,269
abused and frankly you need for

97
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:15,010
untraceable profiles is because you

98
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,780
never know when you're going to show up

99
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:21,849
on the Internet okay again continue

100
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,859
metadata refer to that that is just a

101
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:26,259
data that provides information about

102
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,759
other data some of us in the room have

103
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:30,310
used maybe data that compromised a

104
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,960
target we look for the user names

105
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,259
Durrell host names operating system

106
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,758
software versions etc to further attacks

107
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,249
but how often do you think about in your

108
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,110
engagements metadata threat hunters have

109
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:44,439
several models to correlate metadata

110
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,169
such as the diamond in the sticks and as

111
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,189
attackers we need to know about these

112
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:50,770
information models they have about our

113
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:52,810
metadata and the fact remains every

114
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,568
threat under vendor has profiles on

115
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,939
major pentest companies besides the

116
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:59,500
threat actives our go-to plays the phone

117
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:02,500
numbers the service providers the CG

118
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:07,349
certain first initial vectors are all

119
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:10,330
traceable trackable metadata so and

120
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,250
because it serve economies I had to

121
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,359
throw this one in there you know because

122
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,500
you actually don't own the

123
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,400
infrastructure when you buy these

124
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,759
services all right creating untrustable

125
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,258
and trackable identities so for myself

126
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,089
thinking about the metadata of

127
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:27,969
engagements with certain higher end

128
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:30,069
targets I was thinking of looking at

129
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:32,469
ways to mimic threat actors that use

130
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:35,620
compromised third party host you know

131
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:38,860
the host the malware or non-interactive

132
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,810
see to a lot of rc2 is all interactive

133
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,639
so we don't worry about this but I

134
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,919
always kind of thinking you know it

135
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,789
would be nice to stick long term malware

136
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:51,128
on a client beacon out three months that

137
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,318
type of stuff I was thinking about how

138
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:54,969
ethical it is to redirect to a similar

139
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,029
form looking company you know what is

140
00:05:54,969 --> 00:06:00,819
the potential impact on their brand and

141
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:03,699
obviously retribution their prepetition

142
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:06,969
service providers now search out that

143
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:09,240
stuff all right so this got me thinking

144
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:12,170
why not use real companies and not

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,120
interest

146
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:17,090
definitely thinking why not use a real

147
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,620
company but an untraceable company to

148
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,750
avoid the negative associations with a

149
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,880
valid company instead of domain fronting

150
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,380
you know an untraceable company would

151
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,240
make it possible to use horrible

152
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,210
software to host not an interactive

153
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,460
malware I mean how would it look if you

154
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,950
use multiple domains all using the same

155
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,950
piece of software from valid looking

156
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,469
companies to the right blue team

157
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,020
or better yet you're using code base

158
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,270
that looks like it is from 2000 again

159
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,859
for the right blue team would that be

160
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,609
enough to throw them off if an

161
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:52,930
engagement goes south alright so again

162
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,310
what is required for a cyber identity

163
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,110
some of the big services for Onis in

164
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,880
human intelligence Facebook LinkedIn

165
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,430
Twitter business services that

166
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,540
respectability and Trust Office 365 G

167
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:07,340
suite drop box cetera virtual private

168
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,280
servers to launch attacks from host

169
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,669
domains engagement proxy engagements

170
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:20,210
through but how can all this be got

171
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:23,060
anonymously so before we start to attack

172
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,590
utilize or abuse a system for hunting

173
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,420
purposes we need to understand that

174
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:30,739
system just basic hacking one on one so

175
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,620
what is the main ways that these cyber

176
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,810
business is used to validate an identity

177
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,490
on their platforms so I've looked at

178
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,220
multiple different service providers and

179
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,620
at the core I've come up terms that I've

180
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,410
determined that the trust model used is

181
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,690
really an email address or a mobile

182
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,940
phone if you can gain one of those two

183
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,700
things anonymously you can actually

184
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,910
start abusing Internet service providers

185
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,539
and Dean of rather bizarre circle of

186
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,950
trust

187
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:04,229
through SSO to gain other services

188
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:07,680
anonymity so

189
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:09,900
my solution to this and this is to wear

190
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,860
the part you go oh yeah of course that's

191
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:17,900
the arrow next to the gas in the car

192
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,249
bomb my easiest solution to create under

193
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,659
untraceable identities and companies is

194
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,699
just really two parts and then no it's

195
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:26,188
not Bitcoin because Bitcoin at its core

196
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,629
is traceable trackable we can talk

197
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:31,650
offline and have at that kind of

198
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:34,140
religious debate later having first for

199
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,718
first having an honest mobile number aka

200
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,689
burner phone is required this is a

201
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,760
trivial thing to get loose mobile

202
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,130
tracfone straight-talking TT are all

203
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,819
available from large box stores they

204
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:50,189
only require activation that's it they

205
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:55,620
do not require any sort of

206
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:58,130
identification to gain this so these

207
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,750
service providers give you numbers

208
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,149
without verifying contact details to

209
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,880
recharge you need just the phone number

210
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:08,699
and a pin on the account into an active

211
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,350
recharge card from the store smart

212
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:12,359
phones are brilliant because they give

213
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,699
you two or three usage by changing out

214
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,440
the SIM providers you gain a Google

215
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:18,599
account or Apple account by using the

216
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,339
right smart phone you gain the means of

217
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,910
two FA either through the text or

218
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:26,310
Authenticator app where the warning is

219
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,529
some providers do expire the recharge

220
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,109
cards so it's just a way of getting the

221
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:33,720
liability off their write off sheets so

222
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,149
you want to make sure that when you buy

223
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,709
these service cards it's a 30-day

224
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,870
service you use it you don't use it

225
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:41,459
that's it just careful with what you're

226
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,470
purchased so you don't waste money for

227
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:46,800
long term companies I prefer you prefer

228
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,120
using VoIP or sip providers or a simple

229
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,269
flip phone just because it's more

230
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,410
economical you better have I did use

231
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:56,880
Google numbers um and they're okay for

232
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,040
engagements the reverse lookup of the

233
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,839
number shows Google with but you know

234
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,120
that's fine if you're using G suite as

235
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,700
your business platform and we're going

236
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,580
to go into that

237
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,300
so how do you get the untraceable and

238
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,160
untrackable thing very simply our man

239
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,689
Johnny that's right cash since the

240
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,920
vendors don't require anything other

241
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,360
than the Simms to provide a phone number

242
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,579
attached purchase at a random large box

243
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,380
store the Simms or the Simms phone

244
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,540
combination and a recharge card is all

245
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,700
you're going to need to get the phone

246
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:34,849
obviously there's tracking of the cell

247
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:37,850
towers etc but and as a side note if you

248
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,310
are working with abuse people or victims

249
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,430
of abuse having a smart mobile phone

250
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:45,829
done this way is a must for

251
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:50,120
communication for them and keeping the

252
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:53,780
channel over from the abuser moving on

253
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,130
so solution to the untrackable companies

254
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,660
this is the second part in this is

255
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:00,290
probably the part that you all came to

256
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:04,490
hear about ok it is actually prepaid and

257
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:05,439
gift cards again we use the cash to go

258
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,960
ahead and buy it

259
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,490
prepaid debit gift cards do not require

260
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,990
any form of validation with create them

261
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,800
several vendors all that requires is any

262
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:21,980
physical address a name and up

263
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,270
self-created pen there are bad ones that

264
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,280
will burn eeeh those are the

265
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,680
rechargeable ones the rechargeable debit

266
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,370
cards are what you want to look for is

267
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,599
if it says verify ID

268
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,370
because of the terror intelligence

269
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,130
reform and terrorism terrorism

270
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,970
Prevention Act of 2004 those requiring

271
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:44,750
SS number of green card or bank count to

272
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:46,250
validate them off-camera

273
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,870
can give you recommendations on which

274
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:50,330
cards to actually use and stuff like

275
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,770
that I just don't want to burn the ones

276
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,810
I use but I will give you that

277
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:55,189
information before spending any

278
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,839
morning's if you look at the back of the

279
00:11:55,190 --> 00:12:00,110
card it will tell you the registration

280
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,480
activation site just take go look at it

281
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:06,550
and it will be pretty clear if they

282
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,350
require any form of identification now

283
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:13,500
what can you do with these prepaid debit

284
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:15,000
cards well just lessons I've learned

285
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,420
when you're setting up the business

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,100
services and the addresses on these

287
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,319
activations are the to activate the

288
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,830
debit cards you want to make sure your

289
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,150
addresses match also the burner phones

290
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,710
the numbers should match the

291
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:33,569
geographical area code of the address to

292
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:36,210
umber phone providers do not restrict

293
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,190
the geographical area code that you will

294
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:41,640
request when you're setting up the phone

295
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,920
I found good business addresses for

296
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,540
businesses to use I look for a shared

297
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,550
office space buildings or multiple

298
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:51,599
tenant buildings that do not disclose

299
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,300
the tenant information at the start of

300
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,210
an engagement I usually pick up a couple

301
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,719
of twenty or sorry sixty or a hundred

302
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,940
dollar gift cards they play they provide

303
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,040
the most flexibility to gain several

304
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,350
months of service without having to

305
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,030
waste any monies you'll see though any

306
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,460
money's left over on these gift cards

307
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:16,829
can actually be placed on to a prepaid

308
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:19,910
provider of EPs service or VoIP vigor so

309
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:23,160
it's a great way of recouping that money

310
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,680
the use use the name on the gift card I

311
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,959
find some vendors don't question that

312
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,229
says gift card recipient just type that

313
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,790
in his name other ones will accept the

314
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:36,600
fake name that you put in when you

315
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,010
activated the card having a card with

316
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,050
the exact morning is more likely to get

317
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,580
rejected because company's validating

318
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,099
cards by placing a penny or dollar

319
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,870
transaction so you want to make sure

320
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,250
that you have a few dollars extra on the

321
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:53,340
carbs cards can expire when you purchase

322
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:55,380
these gift cards some vendors charge a

323
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,450
monthly fee onto the first purchase

324
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:01,560
again this is to get the liability off

325
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:03,840
their balance sheets pay for one years

326
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,020
of service even if the engagement is not

327
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:09,780
that long by buying one year's worth of

328
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,760
service it avoids the some of the

329
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,100
rejections you could receive with a

330
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,350
subscription because these prepaid debit

331
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,320
cards are not designed for that and I

332
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,520
find sometimes they are pin caught when

333
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:26,320
you're signing up what

334
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,910
oh yeah okay so the other addition again

335
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,529
service providers you're looking for the

336
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,800
ones that are credit balance model

337
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:36,700
providers these are your voids a server

338
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,319
point a few other ones you just have to

339
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,200
duct up though fighters that accept

340
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,640
prepaid Visa MasterCard debit cards what

341
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,589
did you think I was going to say Google

342
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:51,310
and an anonymous talk I also found out

343
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:54,250
that PayPal will accept a prepaid debit

344
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:57,099
gift card as the accounts credit card

345
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:00,029
this opens up the whole view of other

346
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:03,760
services that are not cash based

347
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:04,779
providers and we'll go went out it get

348
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,120
that stuff in a second

349
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,439
fifteen minutes good okay so now that we

350
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,930
know the house in the what so we're

351
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:16,240
gonna look at how to create so why not

352
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,260
just use tor well social media companies

353
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,420
and other companies tend to be

354
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,459
untrusting of IP addresses as the end

355
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,500
tor point as we probably all know but

356
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:25,779
what I do find out works really well as

357
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:30,040
using a hidden tor service such as Open

358
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:32,980
VPN on anonymously purchased VPS host

359
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:37,779
then using the VPS host for my

360
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:39,579
activities I have yet to have an account

361
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:43,000
completely closed when a malicious

362
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:45,370
activities are detected this way to the

363
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,860
traditional vp8 fighters there are

364
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,680
others but these are ones I use movin

365
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,720
cash is king when you sign up for just

366
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,890
account number one you don't need any

367
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,480
other information when you're paying

368
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,390
with cash you just mailed a cash with

369
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,500
the account number off and it's good

370
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:04,329
again a year's worth of service I like

371
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:09,149
it it does accept also put the prepaid

372
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:11,319
debit cards private Internet access

373
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:13,660
again they take gift cards and prepaid

374
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,209
debit cards you just need to sign up

375
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,520
with an anonymous email on both of these

376
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:21,729
services can be signed up coming from a

377
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:25,209
tour endpoint so again you want to keep

378
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:27,100
your communication base covered let's

379
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:30,099
see there are others is these are just

380
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,949
ones that I know about that I use and I

381
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,860
know they work this is just basic 101

382
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,000
arm

383
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,560
but if you're not gonna keep your

384
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,180
traffic untraceable at the beginning

385
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,689
there's no sense of going to the rest of

386
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,910
the trouble all right so the companies

387
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,960
whatever is required you need a domain

388
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:53,120
name hosting service email service and

389
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:55,820
social media profiles so these are some

390
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,770
of the companies I use again they're not

391
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,360
doing anything wrong it's just that I

392
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,960
know they work with the stuff

393
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,140
methodology so prepaid services

394
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:12,050
Namecheap great all on one service it

395
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:13,790
gives you DNS VPN hosting email SSL they

396
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,889
have their own SSL it takes a little

397
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,780
manipulation to get let's encrypt to

398
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,459
work but it is possible to get let's you

399
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,280
to work just takes a little

400
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:26,630
configuration there are others as I said

401
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:29,120
GoDaddy blue hosting lots and lots of

402
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,300
once again if you're looking for the

403
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,899
credit based model providers they just

404
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,020
always seem to work and again PayPal can

405
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:44,600
be used to hide monthly service fees

406
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:46,970
from these prepaid debit cards okay

407
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,010
we're looking to create businesses well

408
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,200
what's any what's better than creating

409
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:56,000
using G suite business services or

410
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,760
office 365 both to create the company or

411
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,130
run their campaigns both these services

412
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:05,150
can be part directly or as part of the

413
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:10,640
VPS domain name providing offer G suite

414
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:12,410
um it can set up the domain company for

415
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,330
you or as I said it can be used part of

416
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,220
the VPS provider the only thing that's

417
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,260
required is a prepaid debit card the

418
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,840
ability to modify a DNS record if you're

419
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,580
not buying directly from Google or if

420
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,990
you're buying directly from Google then

421
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,820
all you need is an anonymous email

422
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,110
account besides the prepaid debit card

423
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:32,389
of course you get that with your burner

424
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:36,949
Android phone office 365 I find it works

425
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:40,430
brilliantly PayPal so this does require

426
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,170
a burner phone office 365 is one of the

427
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,040
email vendors that do require you to

428
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,770
have a mobile

429
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,190
because well you can't get you know a

430
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:52,340
mobile phone anonymously let's see it

431
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:55,250
can be set up as a domain name you'll

432
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,379
see that throughout this talk is Fred

433
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,820
fishmonger com that's just the test

434
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,370
domain I used to create up it's actually

435
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,960
not linked to any of my active campaigns

436
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,219
or long term companies but you can go

437
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,800
ahead and take a look at that domain

438
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,550
their services are out there and stuff

439
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,050
of that nature

440
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:13,550
see if you can trace it back to myself

441
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:17,030
I'll be very interested if you can all

442
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:19,639
right all right let's see uh again other

443
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,770
services you can get VoIP uh services

444
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,900
again this is just another one of my

445
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,980
burner accounts this Yannick again just

446
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,750
needs a mobile phone it's a balance

447
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,330
sorry it's just a balance model there

448
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,430
are survivors that you can use with

449
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,210
certain configurations to modify

450
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:39,830
spoofing some of them do require a

451
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,990
hardware bit of hosted in your

452
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,460
infrastructure but what does that do

453
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,980
with your voice campaigns when you're

454
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,180
spoofing a company's a number or a

455
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,970
client's number

456
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,750
and again paid for with these prepaid

457
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,130
debit cards with anonymous accounts now

458
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,740
you'll notice that it says auto

459
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,570
recharging is disabled again you want to

460
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,940
make sure that you avoid these

461
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,470
subscriptions on prepaid debit cards

462
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,670
it's one way to get the transactions

463
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:09,620
rejected alright what else can you do

464
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:13,700
how about an app or developer account

465
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:16,699
yep alright so what you need is an Apple

466
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,190
ID 2fa both of those are gained by the

467
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,660
smartphone it's a hundred and seven for

468
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,600
a personal developer account so get a

469
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,910
card for about 110 match the addresses

470
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,280
between the developer account and the

471
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,980
business services I find that using G

472
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,990
suite or office 365 as the email

473
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:37,590
provider will slide right on through

474
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,740
Apple's authentication or identification

475
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,199
[Music]

476
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,090
you need to keep the burner phone around

477
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,440
for the term of the engagement because

478
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,429
you will need to keep putting in the

479
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,429
token for the two-factor the text

480
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,390
message based boy persists dude work

481
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:58,710
before you think you're gonna load up

482
00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:01,170
malicious code to apples a store it

483
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:04,530
won't work they're very very good at

484
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:06,600
filtering out malicious code but you can

485
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:10,080
actually send a developer signed app

486
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:13,740
code to a target bypassing the App Store

487
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,549
an Apple Store Apple can fix this by

488
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:19,470
actually mailing your code I'll go over

489
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:21,150
something you can't do but if Apple

490
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,720
actually mailed the code to that fake

491
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,929
address

492
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,370
that address that you provided it this

493
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:28,230
would blow it out the window because of

494
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,020
the fact that unless you're being really

495
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,090
unethical or paid somebody else to get

496
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,470
someone in trouble okay so really

497
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,059
quickly you're running out of time so I

498
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,010
want to go through tracing what is

499
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:42,059
required to create these social media

500
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,870
accounts so LinkedIn email address or

501
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:44,220
Facebook

502
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,199
thus you know Facebook's one of the

503
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,450
gatekeepers to identity one of the

504
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,520
things you can do with LinkedIn you can

505
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,669
actually use a prepaid debit card for a

506
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,070
trial of the recruiter account so if you

507
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:58,740
have a target you can go ahead create

508
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,530
this anonymous and triple email address

509
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,480
sign in to LinkedIn use a prepaid debit

510
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,059
card when you're offered to the trial

511
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,860
just cancel it in 30 days and you can

512
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:11,610
just go through as a recruiter pulling

513
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:14,399
out company contacts Gmail it requires a

514
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:17,580
mobile number a lot of email providers

515
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,059
now require mobile numbers or email

516
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,530
address

517
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:21,149
actually one thing I did notice in Gmail

518
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,770
if you're logged in as a with a gmail

519
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,299
account you can go ahead and create

520
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,740
other gmail accounts it's no problem at

521
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:28,200
all

522
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:31,559
beautiful Twitter just email paypal

523
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,179
email address mobile number they will

524
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,250
keep sending you multiple text messages

525
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,960
if you do not validate your account

526
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,730
which you can't because you don't want

527
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,750
to what the prepaid debit cards work

528
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:44,340
brilliantly on these services Facebook

529
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,980
because well that's one of the

530
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,559
gatekeepers mobile number or a company

531
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,360
domain name if you're using like the

532
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,840
Gmail account or a third party company

533
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,918
these Facebook does require a picture

534
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,480
identification proof but you just use a

535
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,230
mobile app and you're good to go to

536
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,570
create the Facebook accounts

537
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,790
um every once in a while facebook will

538
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,490
ask to send a code to the phone number

539
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:12,659
but I just clicked I don't have that

540
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:15,549
number anymore to bypass the check and

541
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,799
they never seem to ask me to change the

542
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:18,639
phone number on the account so you can

543
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:22,210
keep them around forever

544
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,010
okay what about no well things you can't

545
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,660
get you can't get code signing server

546
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,220
you can't get a business or thing it

547
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,770
requires identification and as I said

548
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:33,130
you cannot get a Google business on

549
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:36,340
Google Maps they will send they require

550
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,100
a code to be mailed to you so unless you

551
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,600
have done some manipulation with a

552
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:47,080
business you can't get that code so

553
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:49,959

the extra steps you have to do to
