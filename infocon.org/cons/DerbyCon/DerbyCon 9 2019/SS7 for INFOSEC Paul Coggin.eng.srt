1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,670
data cable TV Metro we all those

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,560
different surfaces I never spent any

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,629
time there working on ss7 there was

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,030
always like one person who knew ss7

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,230
and they took care of that piece so I

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,900
was really curious about how it's the

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:21,359
seven work and how how SSL one's getting

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,709
hijacked you to do this MS hijack

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,810
stealing people's two-factor

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,310
authentication so on

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,380
[Music]

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,299
just about how how do you get into the

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,780
ss7 and how does this accept work is a

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,300
secure spot of myself but but the

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,940
details

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,599
of the protocol

17
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:43,530
so so my approach on this talk is to

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,910
show you how someone how the ss7 works

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,800
high-level architecture never gonna dive

20
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,589
into how someone may get access to the

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,230
telco network so that they can get into

22
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,970
this at seven network and then some of

23
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,910
the hacks that are happening when

24
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,769
someone gets into the ss7 network how

25
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,319
they do and I go and intercept calls

26
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:19,149
intercept SMS messages going find

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:21,460
location etc go down it's the protocol

28
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:23,170
it allows all the four switches around

29
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,149
the world if you're using your cell

30
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:29,320
phone if you're calling from your

31
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:31,930
landlines to another city we're doing

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,179
this text messaging caller ID not one

33
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,070
one etc you're using this at seven

34
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,280
protocol

35
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,440
you know outside they call it c7

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,940
it's been around to get 90 of these free

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:48,670
to this Mike 75 it's been around a long

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,080
time because like well a lot of these

39
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,290
technologies catalog which seaweed like

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,000
PGP today with all the BGP hijacking it

41
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:58,780
was designed and built between all the

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,420
telcos to interoperate with open trust

43
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,090
relationships everybody trusted

44
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,710
everybody in the telco world by like

45
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,500
when this was all built and so now

46
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,239
obviously we got security problems

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,820
[Applause]

48
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:16,209
Tuesday key terms we'll talk about here

49
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:18,640
there's notes in the network called the

50
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,560
signal transfer point that signal

51
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,589
transfer point think of it as a router

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,290
for the voice network or the PSTN

53
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:32,390
and it not only does it route the

54
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:34,310
messages between the telcos in the PSTN

55
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,230
Network but it also has filter

56
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,780
capabilities like a router has a CEO

57
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,899
access control lists the vstp has

58
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,310
filtering capabilities now and then you

59
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,010
also even know when you talk to someone

60
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,769
about ss7 you'll hear about the service

61
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,000
switching point it's the SSP the service

62
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,730
switching point they're talking about

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,550
look at that if you're in you're in an

64
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,859
enterprise you have your PBX you might

65
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,420
have a say Cisco call manager in the

66
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,700
telco world they have what they call

67
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,980
class five and highest four switches in

68
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,310
classify switches basically think of it

69
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,500
as the PBX there's hundreds of thousands

70
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,440
of customers and that used to be those

71
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,700
classify switches would fill up a large

72
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,440
room but now they've got it

73
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,200
sella dated down thus all switches were

74
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,340
just a couple servers clustered together

75
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,869
you can do everything in software and

76
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,610
then you got the SCP the server's

77
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,709
control point and that's the database

78
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,570
that has all the knowledge about all the

79
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:32,180
users the 800 numbers the mobile

80
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,220
subscribers the calling cars all those

81
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,600
services and that's that's the service

82
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,410
control point the SCV provides that

83
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,840
[Applause]

84
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,970
and when you look architectural II this

85
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,990
is my real high-level architecture

86
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,200
representation in the center you have

87
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,420
your STDs

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,220
that are going to route that's the

89
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,109
backbone to the ss7 Network

90
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,750
yeah what's called feelings which are

91
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,380
the telecommunication leans thinking of

92
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,530
it

93
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,660
I figured traditional TDM circuits and

94
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:06,360
when they depending on the functionality

95
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:07,920
features then they have different

96
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,700
different names forms so between your

97
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,470
STDs

98
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,920
it's called be lanes take up the be

99
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:16,139
links is your backbone links between the

100
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,329
different STDs and so7 network and then

101
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,150
you have the seedlings and if the

102
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,220
network is large enough they may cluster

103
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,650
the STDs together with seedlings and

104
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,650
then you have paid links late links go

105
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,750
and connect out to your SSP your

106
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,638
classify platform tandem switch

107
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,300
reclassify switches provide more than

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,490
all services for the SCP the service

109
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,560
control point where the database is it

110
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,410
made you statements those a links are

111
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,500
basically T ones or in a different part

112
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:49,380
of the world outside the US maybe once

113
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,450
and then if you have a need for a lot

114
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,700
more density because the load on the

115
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,719
network they may have feelings which is

116
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,050
basically serves the same function

117
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,759
now

118
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:06,180
like I'm an old-school telco guy Network

119
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:09,150
person it used to be before but when

120
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,000
modems modems were still popular that a

121
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,969
high-speed if they had a large enough

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,460
volume of modem traffic that they high

123
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:20,099
speeds or even an enterprise if they had

124
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,349
a large enough number of pris coming

125
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,539
into the enterprise for voice calls that

126
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:27,870
they may use they get eight links

127
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:30,719
instead of using PR i--'s to be able to

128
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,880
save money but nowadays and enterprise

129
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,370
is somebody you don't always use motors

130
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,500
anymore so they've in enterprises like

131
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,870
will have eight links terminating into

132
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,470
it it's going to be yes if trucks

133
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:48,720
everybody these days just history there

134
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:51,020
know where we're coming from on the

135
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,770
Sailor Network break down some of the

136
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,690
functionality we have in the cell phone

137
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,609
network before we start getting into how

138
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,159
to attack the network and how how the

139
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,680
network is being manipulated so some of

140
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,479
the functionality over at the top you've

141
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,000
got what's called the operations

142
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,830
sports subsystem I don't show it but

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,860
over to the right of that could be the

144
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,909
business support system the BSS and

145
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,830
that's there's additional trust

146
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:15,750
relationships there but open operation

147
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,020
support subsystem is think of that as

148
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,110
like the network management automation

149
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:24,139
for the network that's where all the

150
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,970
all you know the hot ball all the

151
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,280
automation and health and status type

152
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,539
operations provisioning that's all

153
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,909
happening out of that operation to

154
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,620
support subsystem block or even having

155
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:37,069
those servers running applications that

156
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:40,340
can drive everything you drop down into

157
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:44,900
the mobile switching center that's where

158
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,849
you get into the mobile switching center

159
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,789
is gonna be like the soft switch called

160
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:50,930
call processing box for the cell network

161
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:52,490
and then you're going to go over to the

162
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,190
HLR it's going to be the home location

163
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:58,159
register R and that's what's going to

164
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,960
keep up with what cell phone mobile

165
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,400
devices are owned by that Network and

166
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,989
then you have the authentication Center

167
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,609
that it's going to indicate devices on

168
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,550
the network and then you've got the

169
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,530
visitor location bridges car yeah and

170
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,199
that's where that database that system

171
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,698
keeps up processes the calls for

172
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,500
visitors when you're roaming across

173
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,990
different networks that's where the

174
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,740
visitor location register comes into

175
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:25,969
play keeps up with weather equipment is

176
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:28,759
authorized stolen what have you and that

177
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:31,330
MSC has connections to the PSTN is the

178
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,409
ss7 and then you get over to the love

179
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,359
then you got the base station controller

180
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:37,639
the base station controller is what's

181
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,430
going to control all the cell sides you

182
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,839
manage the radios and manage handles

183
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,120
from in your roaming and going between

184
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,740
towers in the middle manage the hand

185
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,710
also you'll manage the call processing

186
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,279
and keeping up with where mobile devices

187
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,779
are on the network page and devices etc

188
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:57,050
and reporting what's happening out in

189
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:59,979
the field back up to the bubble

190
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,979
switching Center

191
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,240
like I said I'm an old-school nail we're

192
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,880
guys so I like to see Wireshark pack I

193
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,540
like to see pcaps here's the thing with

194
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,620
ss7

195
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,870
if you go and start looking at a

196
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:14,020
traditional ss7 network you're now going

197
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:17,620
to go drop Wireshark on those networks

198
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,090
because it's a it's a t1 t1 top signal

199
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,280
and you're gonna have a specialized

200
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,780
device inside Ethernet we're getting it

201
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,179
so you'll have a specialized device

202
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,609
typically called a t-bird there can go

203
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,530
in and tap the frames off of a telco

204
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,970
signal and this is but you could go and

205
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,069
import those frames that you can capture

206
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:36,219
with a specialized device say from

207
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,570
Agilent or the t-bird and import that

208
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:38,890
into Wireshark and that's what we see

209
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,710
here and I'm showing you and we don't

210
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:44,439
have IP addresses in this s7 packet that

211
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:48,700
you can see the poll numbers of the

212
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:51,280
calling in the call numbers here but

213
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:54,470
things are progressing and we're moving

214
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,199
- thanks moving to an IP network

215
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,300
and so is ss7 but for backward

216
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,400
compatibility from having to bring all

217
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,530
those features and capabilities of ss7

218
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,010
forward with all of you know where there

219
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:09,020
is 3G 4G now 5g it's all going to be

220
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,340
backward compatible because you've got

221
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,530
parts of the world it have not upgraded

222
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,450
their networks yet so everything's got

223
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,949
to be - communicates - but we're still

224
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:20,120
going to can see here though that we've

225
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:24,020
got ss7 the call process encapsulated

226
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:29,590
into IP it's an IP u companion if you

227
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:32,030
continue you know targeted but here

228
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,070
here's where there's the P place where I

229
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,569
live and the network and this is there

230
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,040
is where the good juicy stuff is and

231
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,600
this is where there's the surface of

232
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,569
attack that it's not talked about a

233
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,060
whole lot this is how this is where if

234
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,390
someone wants into the

235
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,709
telecommunications critical

236
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,760
infrastructure backbone this is how

237
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:52,340
they're going to get in what we have is

238
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,930
the different layers at the very top

239
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,370
this is where the brains of the

240
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,380
operation - did you get your knock your

241
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,780
socks you got your provisioning your

242
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,790
cable TV head in I've spent a lot of

243
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,470
years building cable TV into the telecom

244
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,360
networks where you know blip in your

245
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,980
channels you're changing that you're

246
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,660
changing channels that are mapped and

247
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,400
multicast IP addresses so when you get

248
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,829
your clicker you're actually changing to

249
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,170
not be multicast groups and so all

250
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,390
that's being brought in then you have

251
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,589
your like lawful intercept I have you

252
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,210
know represented Overland lab that's

253
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,510
where they can where you can do an op

254
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:25,280
the base wiretap so your televisor

255
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,410
they have the ability to do to support

256
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,470
clay and the Patriot Act and if they

257
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,060
don't if they get served a warrant

258
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:34,160
understanding yes I've never had to be a

259
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,589
part of that my understanding is is that

260
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:41,300
every warrant every request from law

261
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:43,160
enforcement that gets provided to the

262
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,240
telecom if they cannot support that

263
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,459
warrant it's a $10,000 day fine per

264
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,370
warrant request I can guarantee you they

265
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:57,230
have capability to tap all your phone in

266
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:58,730
their data transactions so I did a

267
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,470
presentation long time ago about this

268
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,810
one of my thoughts is that's a real good

269
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,460
target if you know that the lawful

270
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,359
intercept capabilities on the network

271
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,680
it's there to support law enforcement

272
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,540
back I can get a hold of it is in

273
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,689
decimal juicy information you go and use

274
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:17,260
I believe every was something published

275
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:20,050
where they might have been used off of a

276
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,790
five five screech a few years ago but

277
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,899
what you do those we go we go down we

278
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,269
break down into the center of the

279
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:28,269
network we have where the carrier's got

280
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:30,700
through telco transport networks get

281
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:32,130
your DWDM you might have some legacy

282
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,279
sonet/sdh

283
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:41,019
which is going away you got your DWDM it

284
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:42,760
may be passive or active managed or the

285
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,709
whole program where you can dynamically

286
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,899
provisioned the wavelengths on the fiber

287
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,819
and then you work down into whatever

288
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,800
kind of access network they have whether

289
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:57,130
they're using Han or active Ethernet

290
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,479
maybe they've got some legacy DSL your

291
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,870
cellular backhaul all out there

292
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,149
providing maybe some t1 t1 services

293
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,800
still without there to the edge of the

294
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:07,570
network here's the key thing about this

295
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,609
slide from a security standpoint you see

296
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:13,390
all those boxes and all those call-outs

297
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,130
those are all different vendors and when

298
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:18,250
all this new technology gets propped

299
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:21,640
into this infrastructure the vendors all

300
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:24,100
won't all require it need to remote

301
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:28,240
access into that network to support the

302
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,010
infrastructure so the same engineers or

303
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,510
everybody are implementing this stuff

304
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,569
everywhere and not everybody is being

305
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:38,130
consistent and some people are putting

306
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,850
in bypasses like multi-home Linux boxes

307
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,630
maybe not using two-factor

308
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:46,060
authentication using the same username

309
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,130
passwords everywhere in Riau and it

310
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,649
opens up a huge surface of attack

311
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:53,370
or what I call the VPT defender

312
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:56,709
persistent threat to have remote access

313
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,720
into these networks and to get in and I

314
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,099
said like I said I spent 15 years

315
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,420
building these networks and I was the

316
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,500
guy who's getting called after some

317
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:07,599
vendor got popped it was in in you know

318
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,130
the sauce which was getting taken over

319
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,290
and all the reason they would know is

320
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,459
because some bank over in Europe would

321
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,319
call them and tell them to cease and

322
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:17,050
desist attacking me with you or your

323
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,959
soft switch your phone service that they

324
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,020
just put in or some other one of the

325
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,670
other network managed

326
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,439
boxes in here it was being used to

327
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:28,849
attack your as usually typically their

328
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,830
ideas so if you wanted to go and start

329
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,270
born to go back albums to go and start

330
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,770
think about how to attack these networks

331
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,600
you wanna look at it blue team's name

332
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,640
wanna make sure your stuffs buttoned up

333
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,010
here's a strategy if you're gonna go out

334
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,330
to the telco service about or how I

335
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,040
would look at it maybe you're going here

336
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,950
you're going in and doing authorized

337
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,319
spin test authorized audits let's spend

338
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,200
a great deal of time doing that in the

339
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,660
past here's some things to consider well

340
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,680
when you're out there doing your recon

341
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,689
figure out what they what kind of art

342
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,250
what the vendors are they put a lot of

343
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,770
press releases out bragging about what

344
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,060
vendors they put into the network

345
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,460
whether it's a Cisco whether it's a

346
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,410
Juniper whoever the you know Mehta

347
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,140
switch whatever the vendors are that

348
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,250
they decided to use to build out the

349
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,199
network and then you can go in reverse

350
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,610
engineer the architecture based on all

351
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,820
the open source information that's

352
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,470
available to you and figure out what the

353
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,870
figure out what the key trust

354
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,490
relationships are in that network how it

355
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,320
all melts together so once you finally

356
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,720
get I got a hand hoe maybe you get a web

357
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,430
show you know how to start pivoting into

358
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,040
that Network and what I highly recommend

359
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,510
is to go in and take out information you

360
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,730
need develop yourself on the tech tree

361
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,330
and work through all the logic so you

362
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:40,160
could be very methodical and effective

363
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:44,020
once you get authorized to start testing

364
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:48,130
the network now here's the scenario this

365
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:51,560
this is a real-world scenario I saw a

366
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:55,040
few times when I was doing service

367
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,410
without a consultant you have a voice

368
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,480
which network this is one way this is

369
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,449
one way to get into and get access to SS

370
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,370
7i networks that I worked on when they

371
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,920
got high SS Evan wasn't everything

372
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,750
target the target was always to go and

373
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,380
you they were just people scanning for

374
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,790
OpenSSH services to hike the box to turn

375
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,800
around and use the capability to do our

376
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,439
hairpin turn and go and try to hack bang

377
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,459
that's just this is what I ran into my

378
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,860
career but the folks who got access in

379
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,260
the scenario this scenario here they had

380
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,790
they had access to the voice

381
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,450
infrastructure and they could have gone

382
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,819
and done SMS attacks any kind of sa-7

383
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,429
attack

384
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:38,449
to do hood it took out the whole boy

385
00:15:35,429 --> 00:15:38,449
service for the whole community

386
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:44,579
adenosine arey what you have is by two

387
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:47,878
different vendors representative had a

388
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:51,539
vendor or the transport network and a

389
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:53,789
bender for the salt switch network that

390
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:56,939
was put in brand-new boxes and in both

391
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:59,549
cases these vendors what they were doing

392
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:02,099
is drop in a Linux box multi-home one

393
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:04,439
leg to the Internet one leg into their

394
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:08,100
management plane management access

395
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:10,498
network and totally bypass all of the

396
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,559
security that the internet guys had put

397
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:17,369
in place is what you run into is

398
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:18,988
politics the vendors would go thing they

399
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:21,269
had a relationship with the oyster

400
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:22,979
people who had been there since the

401
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:27,329
cotton original footers to the

402
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:29,910
facilities built had been there and then

403
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:31,559
you had to do the internet folks nobody

404
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,779
liked to talk to you that understood

405
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,488
this IP understood the hackers rinse so

406
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,749
what what happened is the politics would

407
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:38,549
come in play and the vendors could go

408
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:40,769
and get what they want in beer to drop

409
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:44,489
in a multi-home Linux box that bypass

410
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:46,529
the firewall security and then what were

411
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:48,449
instead of locking down trust

412
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:51,179
relationships about what IPS could even

413
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:53,099
find that is-8 servers it'd be open to

414
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:54,419
the world and of course they'd have how

415
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,249
to use the same user accounts and

416
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,509
passwords everywhere and all their

417
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:59,729
customer sites so you they would

418
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:02,999
somebody would be able to jump on that

419
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:05,939
but that Linux box and get access to

420
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:07,409
either the transport network the core

421
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,230
back mountain transport network that

422
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:12,839
everything depends on or into the soft

423
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,789
switch Network so that's one this is one

424
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:20,369
factor that I personally saying that

425
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:24,029
would get you into the ss7 network this

426
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:25,898
is a there's another scenario I same

427
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:28,279
happen

428
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:32,000
this is me this would be a way that you

429
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:34,279
could take over the telco now what

430
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,750
probably this is based on a network I

431
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:41,090
built had a customer wanted to move from

432
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:43,820
60 frame relay sites across the US

433
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,908
wanted to move from home telco away to

434
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:50,379
telco be he was you know a lights-out

435
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:53,120
managed frame relay service in this case

436
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,669
wanted wanted to get up get it all

437
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,029
upgraded and get a better deal on their

438
00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:00,320
services so telco a when they lost the

439
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:02,720
contract we started migrating the

440
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,309
network over the project manager looked

441
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,429
at his Excel spreadsheet I guess and

442
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:09,379
decided it wasn't economical for didn't

443
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:11,539
make sense in the spreadsheet to ship

444
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,000
all the end of life in the cell

445
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:16,700
equipment back to the home office city

446
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,429
to destroyed they abandoned over 60

447
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,669
something routers across the country and

448
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:24,919
then my customer a couple business

449
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,409
transactions later they over doubled in

450
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,460
size and you're like hey tiger

451
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:30,919
we're gonna double the size of this

452
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,480
network but we're not going you're not

453
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:34,730
gonna sell me a bunch of routers of you

454
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,110
you know me being a hardcore cisco guy

455
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,020
he knew what was coming I'd like to go

456
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,399
and give him some clothes to sell him a

457
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,220
truckload of router he's like no no no

458
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:45,289
we've got all these old routers I'm for

459
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,520
going on these things are gonna be

460
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:48,408
recovered

461
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,639
they don't want them back they've

462
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:50,990
abandoned them they don't want them back

463
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,140
I'm gonna return this we're gonna use

464
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,820
the old stuff we're just doing nine IBM

465
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,190
green screen a little internet a little

466
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,620
email how did these from Mos Eisley and

467
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,000
they know what sir Loma hold you going

468
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,299
do password recovery on all that

469
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,940
equipment that it's abandoned what is in

470
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:09,649
there everything all the access control

471
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,500
list all the passwords all the router

472
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:16,100
policies all the triple a radius

473
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,899
information tax policy all of the all

474
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,120
the passwords everything left in this

475
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:21,500
equipment out here abandoned make my job

476
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,779
drop of course we did do anything with

477
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,720
it we just got rid of all that and

478
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:29,720
refresh the boxes living her own her

479
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,820
gigs but this is a real case so sir but

480
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,649
but as a strategy to go back and take

481
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,480
over that toko you take all this

482
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:36,889
information that we got that they just

483
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,000
gave us

484
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,420
because they looked good in the

485
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,540
spreadsheet you could take all that

486
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:47,690
information very easily in going to

487
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,399
recon on say Linkedin etc so other

488
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:53,330
social media and come up with a good

489
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:57,350
strategy to go and hit the the build

490
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:59,149
engineers maybe the NOC Sakai's can be

491
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,189
able to go fishing and maybe to find

492
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,350
your way based on all the Intel that you

493
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,720
gathered here of knowing all knowing a

494
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,149
lot of the boxes in the NOC you'd be

495
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,919
able to pivot your way in and be able to

496
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,419
video I'll do a surgical strike against

497
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,250
their network is they've given you so

498
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,809
much detailed information that you don't

499
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,130
have to go and do for scanning all you

500
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:18,168
just got to get that initial hand home

501
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,169
you can go direct in and attack them and

502
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:22,520
then pivot over say into their

503
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:26,240
provisioning system and work your way

504
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:31,879
down into the ss7 Network another other

505
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:34,220
parts of the image version oh now here's

506
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,929
what's going so now we put we're talked

507
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,730
about this for how to get a couple

508
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:41,390
examples how to get in access into the

509
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,980
telco network what are the what are they

510
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,720
actually doing my first thing you're

511
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,390
going to do say if you're targeting

512
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,370
someone

513
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,350
so we're targeting Darryl back here we

514
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,830
want to get Darryl's gonna go after

515
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,510
Darryl and we might have his phone

516
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,519
number we may know might know where this

517
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,029
provider is made possible in part of the

518
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:02,860
country's and we can get the STD code

519
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:04,720
information so what we can do if we've

520
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,610
got access into this telco network we've

521
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,940
got a little bit pratfall number we've

522
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,189
got an STD code we could go and forge

523
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:16,809
message is going to Kraus messages as

524
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:18,700
the SMS Center box press messages send

525
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:21,908
it up to the mobile switching center

526
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:25,539
over to the HLR home location register

527
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:28,990
in and find out all of his information

528
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:31,110
like what is his HL r whose word is the

529
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,850
VL r of the visitor location register

530
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,678
and we key thing is we want to get the

531
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:40,330
MC information we want to get the MC

532
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:44,080
code for his following the MC ID for his

533
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:46,539
SIM card stuff so that we can go you

534
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,439
start directly targeted so that's the

535
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,658
first thing we're gonna do we're going

536
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,380
to go inquiry start trying to get the

537
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:54,820
ECHL are the VL are all that information

538
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,679
since we got access to this and seven

539
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,330
Network it is B there's a big trust

540
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:01,450
relationship in the instance of network

541
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,490
similar like BGP of the BGP is being

542
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,860
fixed now we're starting to lock down

543
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,480
the security of the BGP more between

544
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,799
peer network that's a seven there's

545
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,380
still that same circular trust

546
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,480
relationship so we can go out there and

547
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,519
query it once we have that information

548
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,909
we've got the cellphone number we've got

549
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,649
the MC who know the visitor location

550
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:23,950
register R we know the home location

551
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:26,289
register now we're now we're ready so

552
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,990
now we can go and craft messages we can

553
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:31,450
see messages from say the telco that

554
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:34,269
we've got access to and we could go and

555
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,830
see messages up into their mobile toward

556
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,059
the mobile switching Center which would

557
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,189
sent it over to this home location

558
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,658
register and find out where they're

559
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,830
located there's a feature called any

560
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,539
time interrogation

561
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:46,360
any time interrogation has been turned

562
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:47,860
off on most of the cell networks but you

563
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,139
there's always going to be one it's like

564
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,850
you know some it's left at home that

565
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,559
haven't done their due diligence at any

566
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,480
time to tear education if we got this

567
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:56,830
access if we can go crap messages sent

568
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,570
into the cell phone network we can go

569
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,860
find out where someone is

570
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:03,350
we can go and send this message jump

571
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,879
into the MSE to the HLR and it'll go and

572
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,860
send the message over to the visitor

573
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,100
location register our and then it will

574
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:12,350
go out there and poke send a request out

575
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,679
to the base station controller and find

576
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:17,480
in pain that that bone you find where

577
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,880
they are out on the network and then

578
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,610
return that information to the attacking

579
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,990
system where they know where they're at

580
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,399
but like this one this this

581
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,740
vulnerability is going away as more

582
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,440
people turn it off but what is still out

583
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,110
there if you have this access because of

584
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,030
the trust relationships that exist you

585
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,580
can you can still go in and craft

586
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:39,620
messages like you're a home location

587
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,810
register for example mobile switching

588
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:49,310
center and seem queries up into the

589
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:51,409
network up to the HL arm and say and and

590
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,000
say we're looking for this we're going

591
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,920
through this funnel where are they at

592
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,870
and so we don't go aquarium we want to

593
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,700
send a call there so it'll go and go up

594
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,860
to the HLR go to the VL arm

595
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,810
visitor location register and then on

596
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,419
out to the base station controller and

597
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,389
find out in pinging that phone you've

598
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,330
returned that location information

599
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:14,960
requested know where you're at so they

600
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:16,370
can be tracked now it's more interesting

601
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,440
to me and what's been all in the news

602
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:21,929
the SMS is

603
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,430
it's very similar you can do all this

604
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,200
manipulation you can craft all these

605
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,540
packets and send messages into the cell

606
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,130
phone network you know I gave you a few

607
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,129
examples of how you might be to do that

608
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:37,320
if you're able to go and communicate ss7

609
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,290
from sum up from the access that you've

610
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,169
gained into the telco up into the global

611
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:44,790
asset seven o'clock then you're doing a

612
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:47,520
ball these queries why can't we do movie

613
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:50,250
all the others later two layers remade

614
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:54,360
in the middle of taxi we can do the same

615
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:58,320
kind of man mill attack with ss7 where

616
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,300
we can go in and spoof say the mobile

617
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,280
switching Center in send updates

618
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,830
tell them to tell the tell the whole

619
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:08,850
network say hey we prompt over to this

620
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:14,220
note for no longer in Alabama we were in

621
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:16,800
Louisville and a half that way we update

622
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,850
the date the home location grade your

623
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,080
star say for our network anybody that

624
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,000
starts trying to make calls are seeing

625
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,520
text messages as we rerouted up your

626
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,400
glue then we got the opt-in two options

627
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,920
to decide whether we want to form it or

628
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,800
just captured it say captured the text

629
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,870
message in profit no but if we boarded

630
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,250
it on the end-user would never know the

631
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,620
end target would never know that we

632
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,620
intercepted it it just didn't work long

633
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:54,360
text easy does it happen few things to

634
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,040
consider with so7 I'm like I said I

635
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,959
spent 15 years dealing with the telco

636
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:02,610
service providers and working working

637
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,950
with the working on rolling out 100

638
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,139
setup he Ethernet network for the telcos

639
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,330
where they were ripping out the the old

640
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,950
TDM network and going to network there's

641
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:15,899
either base for everything was running

642
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:17,610
over fiber in Ethernet or DSL in the

643
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:21,600
initial basis it was a hundred percent

644
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:24,209
Ivy for the most part everything running

645
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,879
over Ethernet and I never had a

646
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,290
conversation with anyone about testing

647
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,429
those networks we tested all the other

648
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,408
components of the

649
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:34,450
his security architecture reviews of the

650
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:37,750
internet piece the business enterprise

651
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:41,860
piece nobody ever even hired us to look

652
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:43,000
at the Boise piece I think I think

653
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,769
that's a blow hanging fruit you guys

654
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,210
that work with result errs nothing I

655
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,309
guess that's a piece of business to go

656
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,659
pick up with the service about is when

657
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:52,149
you're out there pumping manage your

658
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:55,059
critical infrastructure customers to go

659
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:56,979
after this piece probably it's probably

660
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:59,490
nobody's been there and I just tried to

661
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:03,580
assess that and along those same lines I

662
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:05,320
put a lot of firewalls VPN two-factor

663
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,678
authentication in telcos but we never

664
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,879
but I never was involved with putting

665
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,200
again you're out there if you're a

666
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,210
network systems integrator you're

667
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,789
consulted because they're trying to do

668
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:18,820
good good for your customers trying to

669
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:20,500
improve posture networks just blow

670
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,960
hanging pretty for you here's when you

671
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,289
start talking about the ss7 it's a

672
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,480
different type of firewall you're not

673
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:30,580
you're not selling a check point cisco

674
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,850
juniper firewall there guys there's

675
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:37,360
different vendors is specialized in the

676
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:39,730
ss7 firewalls now a lot of a lot of the

677
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,320
networks I assume because we never had a

678
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,710
firewall conversation or using the

679
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,668
filtering capabilities on the STP I'm

680
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:49,990
assuming I'm hoping that's the case I'd

681
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:52,450
love to go back and get back into those

682
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:55,220
networks again and had those kind of

683
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,600
conversation so again

684
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,370
if you're a part of these networks need

685
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,240
to be auditing the ss7 network not just

686
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:05,489
going in focusing on the data the

687
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,990
internet piece in the transport pieces

688
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,880
of the network's we go and dig into the

689
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,980
voice of more services of the network

690
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,260
how is that all being secured in

691
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,970
specific and specifically drill down

692
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,350
into the vendors of how the vendors are

693
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,360
getting in and make sure the vendors are

694
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,800
doing two-factor authentication and

695
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,840
they're not just going to reuse the same

696
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,428
password across all their customers at

697
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,889
least not on your network because I'm

698
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:28,410
serious I've seen it I seen a lot of

699
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:30,210
networks get hacked this way over the

700
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,220
years where the vendors just used the

701
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,350
same username password everywhere it's

702
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:39,900
easy I think not in about to mention the

703
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:41,070
defaults and again just like the data

704
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,660
networks need to go and get

705
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:44,100
visualization and instrumentation on

706
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,530
those networks even know what's

707
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,850
happening who's accessing those networks

708
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:51,000
where the traffic is flowing from the

709
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,678
data stand walk I've got a few pages of

710
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,179
references if you want to dig into this

711
00:28:52,679 --> 00:29:09,270
few few good books and stuff pretty much

712
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:11,780
it ready got any questions yeah okay I

713
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,780
can't hear you

714
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,629
you

715
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:43,529
I'm not I'm not looking to do more

716
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,529
solutions I hate me

717
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,080
you

718
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,059
there

719
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,970
yeah

720
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:19,059
yeah yeah I have not I have not on the

721
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:21,130
telco side I have as far as the data

722
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:24,250
infrastructure the transport network and

723
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,390
the the Internet infrastructure I have

724
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,100
not looked at it on the voice

725
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,720
infrastructure piece but what I

726
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,209
traditionally find is the same thing you

727
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:36,149
run into the enterprise where STP

728
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:39,250
version one maybe two but defaulted

729
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:42,189
almost always default read-only maybe

730
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,440
maybe a modified community private

731
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,120
stream

732
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,120
maybe there's a CLS but if there's a CLS

733
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:52,590
in place it's probably a spoof oogle

734
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,590
republican crap sntp you spoof it

735
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:20,080
right well that's just a matter you know

736
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:22,149
walking the mids I've acted on this at

737
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:26,049
seven standpoint I have not dived under

738
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:27,639
70 I have not personally tested sa-7

739
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,320
infrastructure I think somebody needs to

740
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:31,418
like I said I spent a lot of years

741
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,349
working on those nets it was never a

742
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:37,450
conversation I look back in like wow we

743
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:39,820
really need to go back and look at all

744
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:43,359
that but but but but we run into there's

745
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:46,479
a lot of there's a lot of politics in my

746
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:48,879
experience that the internet folks the

747
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:52,149
data folks knew they needed to test they

748
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:54,488
need to go check on the posture of the

749
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:58,570
network get somebody else to look at it

750
00:32:54,489 --> 00:33:01,809
get help but on the boys side you know

751
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:03,519
it was a kind of like skated in the you

752
00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:05,619
know skated you just don't mess they

753
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,879
don't let you touch it until until that

754
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:08,879
person who runs it retires

755
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,710
well they may have been very advanced

756
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,540
they didn't have to use very advanced

757
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,880
techniques because they were just doing

758
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:32,590
SSH brute force and SSH brute force work

759
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,910
far now they may have been ninjas could

760
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,540
have been nation-state but they didn't

761
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:39,940
have to show any advanced skills that I

762
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,710
reported my experience that the vendors

763
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:45,850
were just throwing out hope and SSH

764
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:48,220
demons you know using he guessable

765
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,709
passwords or using the same passwords

766
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,510
bad guys may have obtained through a

767
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:54,640
phishing attack or something that they

768
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:56,890
may have discovered great were just

769
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,580
started knocking out knocking out our

770
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,580
customer networks

771
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:12,020
the experiences I had that I saw they

772
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:14,149
were Justin turn it into a bot that part

773
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,339
of their effort to break into bangs

774
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:17,839
who's that that's just what I saw

775
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:22,520
there's no telling what other people who

776
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,710
see I can only imagine what other folks

777
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,060
have done I would imagine other more

778
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,270
sophisticated organizations probably

779
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,629
gotten in and now in hardened assistance

780
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:35,560
better so you keep keep other people out

781
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:35,560
probably still using today

782
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,700
you

783
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:24,349
yeah that's interesting

784
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:30,600
really I'd like to learn more about that

785
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:34,319
I will get down school any more

786
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:38,759
questions I appreciate you taking time

787
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,670
show up my talk today thank you if you

788
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:46,160
want the slides I'll give you all the

789
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,160
slides give me a shout if you'd like
