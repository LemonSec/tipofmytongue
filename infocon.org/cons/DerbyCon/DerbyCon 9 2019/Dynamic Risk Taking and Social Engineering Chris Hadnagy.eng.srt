9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,660
I'm gonna be really jittery because Dave

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,750
had a prank planned for me this morning

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,880
that I botched because I turned it up

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,960
can we turn the volume up no one can

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:46,890
hear me in the back hey hey my bodyguard

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:48,690
I need you master of Av hope I can do

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,770
that but I'm gonna my voice is gonna be

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,480
gone by 10 minutes into this so anyway I

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,730
foiled a prank from Dave this morning he

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,550
was supposedly gonna call me up on stage

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,059
to do the opening keynote and I wasn't

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,489
there

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,378
so he told me I apologize for whatever's

22
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,229
about to happen to you so if I seem a

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,280
little jittery that's why okay but we'll

24
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,229
see if we can get through this without

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,220
the prank maybe we'll get lucky for one

26
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,420
final derbycon

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,798
well yeah I know I know okay so today's

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,810
topic when I talk about a dynamic

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,150
risk-taking you just got to give me the

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,619
like give me a sign if I'm not being

31
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,869
loud enough for those in the back and

32
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,759
the way I want to do this is by telling

33
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,119
you the five lessons I learned from

34
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,500
being a risk-taker and also the some

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,119
stories that go along with each of those

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,380
and then how we can apply that in

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,759
everyday life whether you want to be a

38
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,298
social engineer or you're just looking

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,720
to take some risk to expand expand who

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,149
you are so first what is risk let's

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,640
define it here's an example this is an

42
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,189
example of risk on a test not a very

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,329
good one right it's a stupid example of

44
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,639
risk and that's not what I'm speaking

45
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,559
about I'm also not speaking about this

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,290
kind of risk which is putting ourselves

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,509
in danger with no thought so to really

48
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,399
define what I thought about risk is that

49
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,710
let's look at the actual definition

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,469
right so the definition of risk being a

51
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,628
situation involving exposure to danger

52
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,280
that's risk now what could that mean

53
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,739
look it means so many different things

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,050
we'll define that right as we go through

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,790
but risk-taking is a whole nother level

56
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,530
of that so it's not just about

57
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,090
understanding risk it's also about

58
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,600
understanding those who want to take

59
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,880
risk

60
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,769
so that's defined as the willingness to

61
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,079
basically put yourself in that path of

62
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,680
danger and then if we add the word

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,790
dynamic to it that's a constant change

64
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,270
changing so I really can make the

65
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,739
definition of dynamic risk-taking is the

66
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,750
ever changing we learn is to expose

67
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,660
yourself and maybe those around you like

68
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,780
your team into dangerous situations with

69
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,310
the hope of desired outcomes so if we

70
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,260
think about that definition throughout

71
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,640
the rest of this speech you'll help to

72
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,410
understand how this can help us in

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,100
growth no matter what our goals are

74
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:59,370
am I still too quiet in the back no okay

75
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,530
good I'm getting maybe some what we

76
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,030
can't get pale in we can't get our AV

77
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,710
lady back here to turn this the heck up

78
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:10,320
can we yeah she went this way she's

79
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:14,070
probably with Dave okay so let's talk

80
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,950
about that yeah so this is the first

81
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,299
lesson I learned in out of the five

82
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,320
lessons that I learned that we're going

83
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,780
to talk about this morning the first

84
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,940
lesson I learned which is indecision is

85
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,500
worse than no decision and I have a

86
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,329
story to tell you to kind of define why

87
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,570
I think this is a very important lesson

88
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:33,090
that we can that we can learn so I had

89
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,820
we had a job that involved us breaking

90
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,910
into a health care facility and it was

91
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,739
in a in an area in the northwest and we

92
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,630
did a lot of ocean on the place before

93
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,910
we went out there and we found out that

94
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,070
there was a large construction project

95
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,590
right next door to the facility that we

96
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,049
were supposed to break in and it was it

97
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:56,400
was just the end of winter before spring

98
00:03:52,050 --> 00:04:01,170
and the construction dear good the

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,560
construction project sorry you know the

100
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:08,309
first Derby con ever Dave had tried to

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,290
hire a poop throwing monkey to he and he

102
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,390
found somebody he put an ad on

103
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,950
Craigslist and he found a poop throwing

104
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,480
monkey and the hotel wouldn't let him

105
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,079
bring it in because it's an OSHA

106
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,670
violation so you know like this is not

107
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,740
the kind of risk I'm talking about so

108
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,320
I'm here talking about being risky but

109
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,850
I'm scared okay so that's not the kind

110
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,800
of risk I'm talking about this

111
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,670
the risk anyhow this construction

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,110
project was was stirring up all these

113
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,360
little tiny spiders they were non

114
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,740
dangerous but there was just billions of

115
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,260
that usually come out in spring and

116
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,580
people don't really notice them because

117
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,830
they're all outdoors but because it was

118
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,120
colder these spiders were crawling

119
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,229
inside the buildings and they were

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,210
infesting there was a big newspaper

121
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,880
article about it that we found in our

122
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,969
ocean so we developed a really really

123
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,870
good pretext which was a pest control

124
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,610
company so we had walked around saying

125
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,710
that we were hired by the construction

126
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,960
company to come in and do free spraying

127
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,789
to take care of the spiders and we had

128
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,640
all these nice little spray jugs filled

129
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,200
with blue Gatorade which just as a note

130
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,010
for anyone who ever decides to steal

131
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,280
this pretext

132
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,020
when you spray sugary substances in a

133
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,880
client's place you would track the very

134
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,729
insects you were trying to say you were

135
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,500
killing just I'm not saying that

136
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,630
risk-taking always means intelligence

137
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,970
that sometimes you make some dumb

138
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,430
decisions but that's another story for

139
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,920
another time so we had this perfect

140
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,080
pretext our outfits were perfect we had

141
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,030
everything it was really perfect I'm

142
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,710
like this is gonna work we walk up to

143
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,710
the front door we get in and security

144
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,789
stops us and they say we're not letting

145
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,489
you in because you're not on the list

146
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,750
and I'm like dang like you kidding me

147
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,820
like we're getting shut down that fast

148
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,770
was the first 30 seconds and I was for

149
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,980
sure that this was all that this was all

150
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,270
gonna this was all gonna win so you know

151
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,770
we don't want to give up so we come out

152
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,570
of the building we walk around the side

153
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,650
and we're walking around the side of the

154
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,090
building trying to see if there's

155
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,830
another way that we can get in and

156
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,260
there's a group of people out there

157
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,010
smoking now I even though I sound like

158
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,440
this all the time

159
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,170
I'd never smoked I don't like cigarette

160
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,480
smoke smell but I'm like you know we can

161
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,210
use this so I walk up to the group of

162
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,410
people smoking and they say hey can I

163
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,930
just stand here and breathe the fresh

164
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,100
air and they all laugh and chuckle and

165
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,990
look at me and I'm like I'm trying to

166
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,490
quit but you know for these if I stand

167
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,320
here it's like a cheat so this way I

168
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,240
didn't they weren't gonna offer me a

169
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,469
cigarette and I'm gonna be having to

170
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,820
smoke something and choking to death

171
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,310
that everyone would know that I couldn't

172
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,780
was never a smoker so they laugh and

173
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,520
they're like oh yeah I quit six times

174
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,659
and one guys I got quit eight times and

175
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,880
I'm like yeah this is my fifth time

176
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,199
quitting so we all have this now common

177
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,840
bond over

178
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,580
being trying to quit smoking no one even

179
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,008
asked what I was doing because of that

180
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,090
conversation so now I walk in the

181
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,800
building with them and they're all done

182
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,779
on their smoke break and they hold the

183
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,060
door open for for me and Michelle and we

184
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:56,249
walk in the side and we're going with

185
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,930
the group now and this is the part that

186
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,789
we didn't understand what's gonna happen

187
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,099
as we're walking the whole group is

188
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:03,840
walking back towards the front where the

189
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:06,688
security guards are that just kicked us

190
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,310
out so I'm like you know this is all

191
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:09,599
happening and you're still walking so

192
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,960
you know you're thinking like crap what

193
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,878
do I do

194
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,560
you know do I throw Michelle in front of

195
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,310
me let her get arrested I run you know

196
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,650
what's the plan

197
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,300
so I didn't do that and Ella you can't

198
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,159
plan this stuff an elevator had just

199
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,180
opened like it opened it was all the

200
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:23,219
elevators were badged

201
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,930
and I literally just took a left and

202
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:26,550
walked in the elevator and said him I

203
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,889
had a really hope Michelle's behind me

204
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,110
right so gotten the elevator turned

205
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,310
around she was there and we just looked

206
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,699
at the lady and said hey can you bad

207
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,169
just a 15 and she did right so the moral

208
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,819
of the story the lesson that I learned

209
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,409
with this is sometimes things don't go

210
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,639
the way you want right they don't go the

211
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:44,610
way you want you have to be able to take

212
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,319
the risk to win right and if you sit

213
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,089
there saying I don't know what to do I

214
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,919
can't decide what decision this pretext

215
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:51,750
was perfect this was the path that was

216
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,389
supposed to work that lack of

217
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,610
decision-making that indecision really

218
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,710
can cause cause of failure and your job

219
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,080
and everything that you're doing here's

220
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,609
some of the lessons right so what I

221
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,500
found and this has happened to me so

222
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,479
many times I'm so worried about making

223
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,889
the right decision so worried about

224
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,318
making a decision that's going to lead

225
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:12,060
to the desired outcome that indecision

226
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,149
is what occurs and that indecision

227
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,409
really can lead to to more failure so

228
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:18,360
and although we're going to talk about

229
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:20,399
failure I think that what's important

230
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,370
for this first lesson is that critical

231
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,649
thinking is really a major key of the of

232
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,409
the risk takers life being able to

233
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:29,460
critically think through situations

234
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:30,870
dynamically take that risk not worry

235
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,360
about the outcome and hope everything

236
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,899
hope everything works out has been a

237
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,110
great life lesson for me as number one

238
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:41,818
okay the second one being comfortable be

239
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,279
comfortable with being uncomfortable

240
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:46,740
this may sound really odd as a life

241
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,089
lesson or as a risk-taking lesson but

242
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,579
this actually has become like our

243
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,529
company mantra is to force yourself to

244
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,699
do things that really don't make you

245
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:57,060
feel great

246
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,530
now that might sound not healthy but we

247
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,260
don't mean putting yourself in like

248
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,900
undue harm but challenging yourself to

249
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,990
step out of your comfort zone and when I

250
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,760
was thinking about this story I thought

251
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,710
literally there's no there's there's no

252
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,810
better person to really use as an

253
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,350
example of this than Ryan right so if

254
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,819
you haven't seen his his Def Con speech

255
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,080
there'll be a link on the next slide or

256
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,940
on this slide I think it's you know just

257
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,100
put it up there it is I'll put it up

258
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,420
there so you I needed a bitly link which

259
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,340
of course makes a lot of sense when

260
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,829
after I did it I thought who's gonna go

261
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,600
to that so if you don't trust me which I

262
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,670
don't understand why you wouldn't you

263
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,980
can just go to youtube and type in Ryan

264
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,540
McDougle Def Con and you'll find the

265
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,090
speech but the reason that you should

266
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,209
watch this this speech is because this

267
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:44,730
is a person who sorry Ryan I'm gonna you

268
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:47,070
know embarrass you in front of five

269
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,260
people it's fine so okay yeah you're

270
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,240
ready on YouTube so this is a person who

271
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,580
is very uncomfortable being in front of

272
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,560
large crowds and talking to large groups

273
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,960
of people and when he started working

274
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,150
with me I challenged him to become a

275
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,560
speaker to become a public speaker now

276
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,420
not everybody would rise to that

277
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,560
challenge with the fear of large groups

278
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,300
that the fear of being in front of

279
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,089
people but Ryan's not that kind of

280
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,770
person he's got a person that actually

281
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,560
enjoys stepping out of his comfort zone

282
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,810
in order to make himself better to

283
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,520
improve his skill set and does that mean

284
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,829
everything he does is always going to be

285
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,210
perfect no but it doesn't matter that's

286
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,800
not the goal the goal is not to be

287
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,660
perfect at everything the goal is to

288
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,910
challenge yourself to get out of that

289
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,079
comfort zone so you have a growth and I

290
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,150
don't want to tell the whole story and

291
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,680
ruin it which I'm not going to so you

292
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,630
need to go listen to that that speech

293
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,640
and when you do you'll understand the

294
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,439
lessons that are here on the screen for

295
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,110
this particular second lesson at

296
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,540
risk-taking is how important it is that

297
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,220
when you when you take that risk to step

298
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,410
out of your comfort zone that you're

299
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,120
willing to allow that discomfort to be

300
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,850
your teacher that you allow that

301
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,990
discomfort to help you grow and expand

302
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,610
who you are as a person

303
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,810
whether you're doing it for your career

304
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,510
early your own personal development

305
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,979
right and when you do that something

306
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,560
like this the statement that I put here

307
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,110
sometimes the only way you know

308
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,300
understand how like butterflies

309
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,350
metamorph into their caterpillars the

310
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,089
other way around

311
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,740
so when they when they put themself in

312
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:13,020
the cocoon they actually liquefy

313
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,990
themselves that sounds really gross

314
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,420
doesn't it they they secrete an enzyme a

315
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,820
caterpillar secretes an enzyme and their

316
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,209
whole body breaks down into a liquid

317
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,310
substance that then transforms into the

318
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,460
butterfly that sounds like a really

319
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,290
sucky process doesn't it like I need to

320
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,360
like blend to myself to become a

321
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,500
different thing well that's what

322
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,420
butterflies do when they come out and

323
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,820
they're amazing so I'm not saying you

324
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,589
need to go that far but you may you may

325
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,930
need to depending on what your goals are

326
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:45,330
say when when when right when I first

327
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:48,000
met Ryan he wasn't a social engineer but

328
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:51,030
he wanted to be better at becoming one

329
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,550
so he had to make oh he had to become

330
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,920
that butterfly to metamorph and to

331
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,969
something completely different so if you

332
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,069
have that you're sitting here saying

333
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,810
well how can I do how can I become a

334
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,490
social engineer how can I expand my

335
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,140
career in this field that may be

336
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,030
necessary depending if you're an

337
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,040
outgoing person that loves to be in

338
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:10,589
front of people or if you're not so i

339
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,380
really suggest you you listen to that

340
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:16,350
speech and and you'll learn you're

341
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:19,290
learned so much from him okay the third

342
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,000
lesson finding good people now when you

343
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,680
take risk sometimes you know you get

344
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,480
yourself in situations where you don't

345
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,040
always you know you may you may be in

346
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,660
the wrong group of friends or in the

347
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,610
wrong job or you're working with the

348
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,810
wrong kind of people or you're hanging

349
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,070
out with the wrong kind of people that's

350
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,140
what I mean but there's all of this

351
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,880
applies alright so how do you find good

352
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,460
people who defines good well you have to

353
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,130
define that for yourself right what does

354
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,690
it mean to you to have someone that can

355
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,460
support you or a group of people that

356
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:47,490
can support you and what does that look

357
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,860
like so here's here's the the story the

358
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,440
lesson that I have for you when we talk

359
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,850
about this so after I hired the the

360
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,070
butterfly that I call Ryan which I had

361
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,520
to make this picture because I thought

362
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,080
that's such a great picture isn't it I

363
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,490
actually had this thought about over

364
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,020
whiskey last night and I'm like I didn't

365
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,430
finish but I got to come here early and

366
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,260
finish this I did this this morning so

367
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,459
that's why it's not so great sorry Ron I

368
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:13,230
don't think I'll leave that there for a

369
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:15,210
sec no problem no we don't have a manual

370
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,450
we don't have a manual at work so

371
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,280
there's no workplace harassment okay now

372
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,230
so

373
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,520
that's the way we avoid harassment at

374
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,400
work I don't have a manual that says I

375
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:29,329
can't do it so it makes it fine right it

376
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,189
makes it fine okay so then I'm not I'm

377
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:34,640
not talking after I'm talking literally

378
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:37,010
the moment after I hired Ryan I'm like

379
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,710
hey we're gonna fly to a foreign country

380
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:42,410
and break into three banks that was like

381
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,150
his introduction to welcome aboard let

382
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,300
us go to this foreign country and break

383
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:50,240
into a few banks and and he's like so

384
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,740
give me some details and I'm like yes

385
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,180
we're gonna do Oh sands we got to break

386
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,950
into the banks we got to breach the

387
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,930
network if we can we got to do all this

388
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,430
stuff in their arms and he's like what

389
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,989
and I'm like oh nothing don't worry

390
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,910
about that last part it's like you say

391
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:05,590
they're armed I'm like nah it's fine

392
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:08,810
perfectly don't it's good the good buddy

393
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:12,740
they run yeah they're they were pretty

394
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:14,599
much really really armed so we did a lot

395
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,880
of ascent we found out we were very

396
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,950
fortunate that the the banks had just

397
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,050
congest we're in the midst of completing

398
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,910
their PCI compliance tests so we

399
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,829
basically went of course a lot of them

400
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,439
had to redact things but we went and

401
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:31,370
made but we felt were PCI compliant

402
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:35,270
outfits right hey that looks very PCI

403
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,470
compliant he doesn't it anyone know you

404
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,790
guys are not my good friends you're not

405
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:46,089
supporting me here okay aren't you

406
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:48,490
learning the lesson no so

407
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,870
when and we had actually the the shirts

408
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,059
and the cards everything made up of the

409
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,879
company that just finished a PCI

410
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:56,740
compliant compliancy test and we thought

411
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,540
well walk in we'll tell them that we're

412
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,980
here to finish the test because there

413
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,670
was some things that were left undone

414
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:08,740
and neither of us ever had done PCI

415
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:10,930
compliance enough up as we go so we came

416
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,420
up with this genius plan that we would

417
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,239
print out these red stickers that said

418
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,410
approved on them and that if we got into

419
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,999
the building that the way that they

420
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,589
would know we approved them is we would

421
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:23,079
have to put a sticker by every Network

422
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:27,009
jack so that would mean that they were

423
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:28,628
approved sounds logical right okay no I

424
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,879
know I know but if we were trying okay

425
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:32,980
we were trying so we get to the the

426
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,199
front the front of the the building and

427
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,459
like we said it's barbed wire there's

428
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,620
armed guards you know we don't know

429
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:40,719
exactly what we're what we're gonna do

430
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,610
to get in so I'm like I said the Ryan

431
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,499
look just just follow the lead I'm gonna

432
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,149
get on my phone I'm gonna act like I'm

433
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:48,069
talking to somebody that's already

434
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,230
upstairs and we're just gonna walk past

435
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:51,639
security we're not we're not gonna get

436
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,589
stopped right we're just gonna walk past

437
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:54,879
so we walk in and I'm doing that I'm

438
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:56,980
like hey yeah we were coming upstairs

439
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,170
now yet we got all the paperwork and

440
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,970
nobody stops us so we walked upstairs

441
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,040
we've never seen this building we don't

442
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,899
know what's up there and we we get up

443
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,139
around the corner there's a door that

444
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:10,600
says ATM Testing Center we're like that

445
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:12,040
sounds like fun and there's a woman

446
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,569
who's literally coming in front of us

447
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,459
walking in so we're like we just turn

448
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:16,809
and walk in after her and she turns

449
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:20,050
around and she's like excuse me and I'm

450
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:23,060
like we're doing PCI auditing and she's

451
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:26,300
like okay and she walks away

452
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:30,140
and I'm like okay Ryan do the audit

453
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:32,959
thing so that's what I know right so

454
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,960
Ryan is literally crawling inside of

455
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,310
these giant ATMs and taking pictures and

456
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,100
stuff and putting approved stickers

457
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,660
everywhere and and I'm standing there

458
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,040
talking to this guy and I'm like and

459
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,990
he's working on the machine on my case

460
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,740
Oh tell me what you're doing and he's

461
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,690
explaining the process of loading

462
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,310
Windows 7 on these things and he's

463
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,780
showing me how he's doing it and I'm

464
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,640
like oh that's interesting and what does

465
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,230
this do man what does this piece do let

466
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,090
me take a picture of that for the audit

467
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,390
and we're just standing in there talking

468
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,590
to them non-stop right where there's so

469
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,670
many stickers around the place that

470
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,620
we're fine like okay we should probably

471
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,720
leave this like we've you know actually

472
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,909
owned this whole thing so we exit there

473
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,800
and we're walking down towards two doors

474
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,870
that we could clearly see that they're

475
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,560
locked and they're RFID but it's the

476
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:20,000
call center for the banking unit we're

477
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,099
like let's just walk a little slow and

478
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,349
see what happens and as we approach it a

479
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:26,089
woman is coming out so I go let me hold

480
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,040
the door for you so I you know surely

481
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:30,530
hold the door open she exits we enter

482
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,200
now this is the part you can't plan it

483
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,930
was Christmastime and there was these

484
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,750
giant Christmas balls hanging from the

485
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,870
ceiling and I turned the Ryan to like

486
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,990
tell me ever in a like faceplant into a

487
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,520
giant Christmas ball right I mean the

know it's cool not to kill me

595
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,870
this guy could have picked me up and

596
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:54,289
broke me in half vinegar let's just say

597
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,969
we didn't pack that one right we walked

598
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:57,950
out and just said I think life is better

599
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,720
right now we'll just we'll just call

600
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:02,090
that one a win and this one not we're

601
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,580
cool with that right but the point of

602
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,168
all this is that the story is that this

603
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,990
was his first job with me

604
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:10,429
we he got hired and we're doing this and

605
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,440
I knew right then and there like this is

606
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:14,870
the kind of people you want to surround

607
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,730
yourself with now for me right because

608
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,379
this was the career path I had this is

609
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,480
what he wanted you get these kind of

610
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,280
people and and then what happens well

611
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,380
that was we had a small team at the time

612
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,030
so you know if you if you've been at the

613
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,190
DEF CON se village you come downstairs

614
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,780
here you'll get to meet the people that

615
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,169
I've been able to work with over the

616
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:35,450
last half a decade or so and they're

617
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:37,520
just amazing people now that doesn't

618
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,980
mean that that has always been the case

619
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,929
sometimes you make some mistakes yeah

620
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,190
you get people and they're not the best

621
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:44,539
or you get with friends that you think

622
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,789
they're gonna be you're great friends

623
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:49,610
and they turn out to not be so great

624
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:51,740
well what do you do then here's some of

625
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,479
the lessons I learned right just because

626
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,760
somebody really really really wants to

627
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,190
be a social engineer doesn't mean

628
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,710
they're gonna be good at the job right

629
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,059
that is oftentimes the case sometimes

630
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,370
people really really want it because

631
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:06,559
it's cool they think it's a sexy job

632
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,689
it looks awesome but they're just not

633
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,480
good at the work okay that's fine

634
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,100
instead of continually trying so much

635
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,929
and failing and then making yourself

636
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,490
feel bad that's a great lesson to move

637
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:18,080
on and it doesn't mean you're a failure

638
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,330
at life it just may mean it's not the

639
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,129
job for you right so we if you don't

640
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,928
know I you know you can come downstairs

641
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,549
and we'll talk about it I started a

642
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:28,220
non-profit foundation called the

643
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:35,270
innocent lies foundation and we we use

644
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:37,820
thank you the mission for the ILF is to

645
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,408
is to unmask people who create and

646
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,330
profit from child pornography and child

647
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:43,429
abuse material and they try to use the

648
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,960
Internet to hide and we unmask them and

649
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:46,970
then we're not a vigilante group we hand

650
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,500
them off to law enforcement so that way

651
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,470
they can be they can be dealt with in

652
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,570
the judicial system and we have people

653
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,610
that come and they hear me talk about it

654
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,129
they hear Shane talk about it they see

655
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,629
the videos and they get emotional maybe

656
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,820
they've been affected in their life and

657
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,200
they come and they want to sign up they

658
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,668
want to be part of the I left they want

659
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,350
to work they want to have cat they want

660
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:07,850
to help catch predators they want to

661
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,959
save kids because that feels good I'm

662
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,480
telling you it's like the best feeling

663
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,669
in the world to be able to do that but

664
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,679
then we start describing the kind of

665
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:19,490
work they're gonna have to do and they

666
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:22,070
realize I can't do that and that's great

667
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,870
to realize that before you try because

668
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,370
trying sometimes in that level that's

669
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,979
gonna cause a lot of damage you know

670
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,539
mentally so and social engineering may

671
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,440
not be that serious but in this case it

672
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:35,080
could have been right sorry i hearing

673
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,909
things it's just making me nervous

674
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,620
and in this case you know we were

675
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,000
breaking into an armed facility so it

676
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,559
could have been very dangerous and if

677
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,090
Ryan was the kind of person that's like

678
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,740
heck no I'm never doing that that's

679
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,178
ridiculous why did you bring me here

680
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,890
then maybe that would have been the

681
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:51,230
great job for him so when you're

682
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,299
choosing your career path your education

683
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,710
path your life path think through these

684
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:58,700
things surrounding yourself with people

685
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:01,279
that that are gonna support you but be

686
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,270
firm right that last one now I'm not

687
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,289
that one that wasn't that wasn't the one

688
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,270
okay I haven't here somewhere

689
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:10,730
but it's having friends that are willing

690
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,070
to to correct you firmly but still still

691
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,780
be loving that's a huge deal right

692
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,580
because everyone needs correction no

693
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,668
one's perfect all the time and if you

694
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,678
have a group of friends

695
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:22,289
or workmates that are good at doing that

696
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,719
then it's an open honest communication

697
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:26,669
relationship which benefits everybody

698
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:33,299
so surrounding yourself with what those

699
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:35,700
good people really can help you okay

700
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:38,369
this next one accepting failure and

701
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:43,979
learning from it this is a great one

702
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:46,499
okay so story time so we we had another

703
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:48,479
job this is now van Singh a little while

704
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:50,099
and with Ryan again and we have another

705
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:52,229
job and we're supposed to go break into

706
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:55,109
this place ahead of time we knew that

707
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:56,519
this place was heavily armed I mean like

708
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:58,829
really heavily I don't like the other

709
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,929
place that was light armament compared

710
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:03,450
to what we were about to break into so

711
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:04,739
we we got there the night before we were

712
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,959
supposed to break into the place and we

713
00:26:04,739 --> 00:26:08,519
thought we'd go scope it out right then

714
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:10,859
we'd go check out the place we knew no

715
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,450
no guards were there so because we had

716
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:14,279
we had done some OSINT so we figured

717
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,519
let's let's go scope this place out see

718
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,349
what kind of entry ways we can have I'm

719
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,450
gonna tell you my first fail on this

720
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:22,649
which I hate talking about but if I

721
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,299
don't Ryan will tell you the story later

722
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:26,518
it'll be worse so I'm gonna tell you the

723
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:29,070
true story not the Ryan version of the

724
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:31,709
story okay now it's gonna be the Ryan

725
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:33,119
version too so we're we risk up in this

726
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:35,219
place out and we don't have any of our

727
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,289
gear on we're just we're just walking

728
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,549
around the place and we're we they have

729
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:40,320
a parking lot there with all their

730
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:42,059
corporate cars we're trying all the

731
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,320
doors we're trying all the windows we're

732
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,839
trying everything to break into the

733
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,999
place and I come around the front and

734
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,279
I'm in this bush like our pretext was

735
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:51,599
that we were again pest control we don't

736
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,179
use that one all the time but this one

737
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,639
just fit for this and we had these UV

738
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,649
lights looking for spiders and scorpions

739
00:26:56,639 --> 00:27:01,320
that we're supposed to spray so I'm

740
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:03,299
rounding the corner and this woman just

741
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,829
comes out the front door like it's like

742
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,309
11:30 at night I'm like whoa she's

743
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:07,709
working late

744
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:09,418
so she comes out the front door and I

745
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:12,629
just take my foot and I put it in the

746
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:14,369
door as it's closing and you know I was

747
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:16,559
behind a bush so I jumped out and did

748
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:17,939
that and she gets startled obviously all

749
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,549
right I mean you know big guy wearing

750
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,779
black jumping out of a bush putting on

751
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:23,249
putting his foot in the door she's like

752
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:24,929
who are you and what are you doing and

753
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:26,759
I'm like we're from pest control we're

754
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:28,729
here to check for spiders we're just

755
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:31,260
going to go in and take care of that and

756
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:34,140
that is all I should have said

757
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,780
and anyone who's been to any of my apse

758
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,190
classes or any se class at all you know

759
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,000
that that is the point where you should

760
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,100
shut up

761
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,370
cuz she was backing away to her car to

762
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,290
leaf I can't stop seeing the fear on her

763
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,270
face and I'm like I don't want her

764
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,070
leaving feeling like we were these

765
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,889
horrible people so I start explaining

766
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:55,080
myself and I look over at Ryan and he

767
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:58,560
has us look at me like shut up you moron

768
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:02,159
and I can't the mouth is now activated

769
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,110
I'm like Gurjit ation of all the things

770
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,390
and then she's like I am not comfortable

771
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:09,120
with you being here and I'm thinking let

772
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,380
us not get arrested this night you know

773
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,320
we're gonna wait till later on of the

774
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,670
week for that so we left right I let the

775
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,080
door closed we didn't get the break in

776
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:19,410
it was a sad moment went back to the

777
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,080
hotel he dragged me for two years and

778
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,490
you know it never ends so we go back to

779
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,870
the hotel and the next morning we're

780
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,960
like we're gonna come and do the pretext

781
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:30,330
so we come back into the parking lot and

782
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,580
we you know I'm batmanning into the

783
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,389
parking spot so I'm reversing in into

784
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:38,129
the parking spot and before I can even

785
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:40,440
park the car like I look over to say

786
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,390
something to Ryan and he's ripped out of

787
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,700
the vehicle slammed on the hood and

788
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,100
cuffed and I'm like he's getting

789
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:52,380
arrested so I put the car and drive and

790
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:58,830
I'm like and he's looking at me like and

791
00:28:52,380 --> 00:29:00,810
I'm like and he's like and I'm like so

792
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,730
this interaction of a few seconds is

793
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:05,639
like I'm gonna go because one of us has

794
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:10,050
got to stay alive to break in it's the

795
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,270
job right and I'm like debating like do

796
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,250
i press the gas and he's like and I'm

797
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,379
like so I've got to put my foot on the

798
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,520
gas in this no joke you can ask she's

799
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,680
like five foot two

800
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,860
five foot three woman that was built

801
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,330
like The Incredible Hulk jumps out in

802
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,429
front of the car pulls her guns to get

803
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:29,760
out of the vehicle and I'm like I think

804
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:31,290
you should put your gun away not very

805
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,129
smart again risk-taking doesn't always

806
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,840
equal intelligence

807
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,460
she's like step out of the car and I'll

808
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,689
put it away and I'm like if you put it

809
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,880
away I'll step out of the car how about

810
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:40,860
that and she's like sir you need to get

811
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,750
out of the car down I'm like I'm not

812
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,209
feeling that right

813
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,250
and right again now he's cuffed he

814
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,740
slammed on the hood he's like and I'm

815
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:54,580
like it's okay I'm gonna get us out of

816
00:29:50,740 --> 00:30:02,800
this it's okay well that was the result

817
00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:03,340
so that was the result yeah so I got

818
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,740
arrested

819
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,689
we both got arrested she slamming on the

820
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,580
hood so hard when she ripped me out of

821
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,460
the car my glasses and hat flew across

822
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:15,550
the hood onto the floor and I said and

823
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:19,540
by the time that I was my face hit the

824
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:22,149

831
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,450

832
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,880
and she starts frisking and then she

833
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,260
finds my knife right and this is this is

834
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,210
a micro tech Halo so it's a

835
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,360
spring-loaded knife but she's doing this

836
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,370
and I'm like oh man please please don't

837
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,270

838
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,739
that's why and I'm like well that's a

839
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,930
spring-loaded nitrogen I thought you

840
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,240
weren't armed on the ground scum and now

841
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,790
I'm on my knees and execution style and

842
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:09,580
I'm like and Ryan's like give her the

843
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:11,530
letter and I'm like so I'm still trying

844
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,179
to talk us out of it you know I'm like

845
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,800
it's okay we can do this we're pest

846
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,360
control look at the back of our car we

847
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,370
have the sprayers like I'm out looking

848
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,439
at anything what are you doing here and

849
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:22,239
we tried like what 15 20 more minutes

850
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,920
I'm trying my hardest we're sweating

851
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,170
people are gathering around taking these

852
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,310
pictures videotaping us you know getting

853
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,810
arrested they're like you want us to

854
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:30,850
call the other cops they're like no we

855
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:34,300
got these scum and then finally it's

856
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,709
like we were gonna get tased or shot or

857
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,020
something bad was gonna happen something

858
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,210
okay okay I have something that will

859
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:42,460
explain why we're here if you just go

860
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,990
get my clipboard ignore all their camera

861
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,000
equipment in it because I had all these

862
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:47,890
micro cameras and the clipboard so we

863
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,110
can record just pull a letter out of the

864
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:51,940
clipboard and it was I'm not getting a

865
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,290
clipboard for you tell me what you're

866
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,780
doing and like please the letter will

867
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:56,470
explain everything she did not want to

868
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,149
hear

869
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,790
anything so eventually we had to tell

870
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,890
her you know we told her then the male

871
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,200
officer went and got the letter and we

872
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:08,740
were we were clear but the the lessons

873
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,580
are failure is the best teacher because

874
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:14,350
I say I can't tell the rest of the story

875
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,389
yeah I can't wait to talk to me later

876
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,959
there's some great parts of the story we

877
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,750
failed

878
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,660
so that week we got a win for in that

879
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,670
week we got arrested three times three

880
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,320
times in one week now that's a record

881
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,390
for me you know usually I got arrested

882
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,389
like once on a job but three times in a

883
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:34,630
week and we got chased by eight fully

884
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:37,750
armed automatic weapon guards out of a

885
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,220
parking lot we and again Ryan's like hey

886
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:42,580
can we just lay on the ground and get

887
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:44,410
arrested I'm like no god I put the flip

888
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,790
the car and drive and I'm like sideways

889
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,190
out of the parking lot he's like we're

890
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:50,379
gonna die I have children at home I'm

891
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,640
like it's fine it's fine fine I keep

892
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,120
hearing myself sounding like Dave it's

893
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:57,070
terrible the lessons were we failed a

894
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,870
bunch of times that week right we failed

895
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,460
a bunch of times but at the end of the

896
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:02,649
week when I thought like man we got to

897
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,470
go tell the client that we failed they

898
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,360
were ecstatic because what we did is we

899
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,650
help them uncover some vulnerabilities

900
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,169
but they also got to see where they were

901
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,670
really really strong they got to see the

902
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:15,340
things that they were doing really good

903
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:17,260
so if you make failure about your ego

904
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,629
and this is a lesson I learned by doing

905
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,060
it right and wrong over the years if you

906
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,070
make failure about your ego then you

907
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,600
can't see that point you can't see those

908
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,149
lessons you can't see that risk-taking

909
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,889
is really valuable because all you're

910
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,660
thinking of us I got a win and if I

911
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:34,180
don't win that that's attached to me as

912
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,880
a man or as pentester or whatever and

913
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,510
that ego portion means that you're going

914
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,810
to put that in front of success so this

915
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,520
pen test was very successful and and to

916
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,649
the point where they are so happy with

917
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,510
all the results but we couldn't have

918
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,100
tied it to our ego so there was a lot of

919
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,810
successes that week too you know we did

920
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,360
end up reaching a couple places there

921
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:57,700
without getting arrested but you know if

922
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,429
you link the failures to your ego you

923
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,350
will always almost always guaranteed not

924
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,410
see the bigger picture and that is a

925
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:10,389
major life lesson I had and and and

926
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:11,950
risk-taking okay and then number five

927
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,079
don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel

928
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:15,609
you know this is a this is and I don't

929
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,710
mean that everyone needs to do this but

930
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:19,509
let's think about this

931
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:22,149
sometimes our industry has been doing

932
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:24,960
one thing the same way for so long and

933
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:28,000
we just keep doing it that way because

934
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,240
that's the way it's been done and yet we

935
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,980
don't see any change right so tonight we

936
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,018
have a panel in the SE village that's

937
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,940
talking about security awareness what

938
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:38,828
works and what doesn't right so we have

939
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,210
a panel talking about that because this

940
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:42,010
is a big problem in our industry right

941
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,418
we go out we pentest we break into stuff

942
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:45,819
we hacked the crap out of everything and

943
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:48,009
then year after year are we seeing

944
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:50,679
improvements and some slight but not a

945
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,059
lot why is that well because yeah we're

946
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,950
getting better at doing the breaking

947
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:56,349
stuff but what about the educating piece

948
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:57,640
afterward so we you have to look at it

949
00:34:56,349 --> 00:34:59,289
something that's not working and say

950
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,730
let's reinvent the wheel let's try

951
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:02,769
something new try something different

952
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:05,140
that doesn't always mean it's successful

953
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:07,419
right like if you think about it you

954
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:10,690
know I've got a chance to start social

955
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,760
engineer social - engineer org twelve

956
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,200
years ago and when I did that it was a

957
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,910
fluke I honestly thought it was just

958
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,519
going to be like me and a few people

959
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,960
that would find benefit from it and that

960
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,758
now we're going on 12 years with that

961
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,890
site ten years podcasting ten years

962
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:25,390
newsletters and it's a content provider

963
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,890
it's that and I'm not saying that about

964
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,319
me because my team does most of the work

965
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:31,210
and they're providing actual actionable

966
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:32,769
usable content to the world on social

967
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,000
engineering that was something that

968
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:35,799
wasn't being done at the time so I'm

969
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,039
really proud of that that spawned off

970
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:41,038
the SE come the Oh God

971
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:56,109
yeah hey Dave hey man love you I just

972
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,630
don't believe him

973
00:35:56,109 --> 00:36:04,779
I don't believe him I don't believe him

974
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:07,089
okay every time I hear the door my

975
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:10,170
sphincter just is a little you know like

976
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:11,589
it's just just hurts a little every time

977
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,150
okay

978
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:15,369
I don't know what I was saying but

979
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:17,560
anyhow all of it led to tests starting

980
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:20,500
to ILF which was spawned out of this

981
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,940
industry right because the the short

982
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,890
version of a very long story if you

983
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,240
haven't heard it yet as we were doing

984
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,368
some pen tests for a company and

985
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,410
uncovered a person who was using their

986
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:31,780
corporate network to produce and trade

987
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:35,319
child pornography and that guy is now in

988
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:37,599
prison and that felt really good because

989
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,790
I never thought in my life that my

990
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,530
greasy little hacker self would ever do

991
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,720
something that would amount to saving a

992
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,670
life right we just break stuff that's

993
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,109
all we do and when I did that and that

994
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:51,250
happened the second time and it happened

995
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:53,859
a third time I went maybe there's other

996
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:56,050
people like me who want to do this stuff

997
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:57,130
and that's when the ayah left was formed

998
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:00,040
but that was reinventing the wheel

999
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:02,260
because when I went to my lawyer no joke

1000
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,690
and I went to law enforcement agents and

1001
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,670
I said what is the reality of a private

1002
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,849
organization helping you hunt those who

1003
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:11,520
create child porn well any harboring of

1004
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:14,859
child pornography in this country is

1005
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,690
against the law so how do you do the job

1006
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:18,460
and make sure that you're not breaking

1007
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:21,430
the law I'm not going to tell you okay

1008
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:23,619
because that's proprietary but we had to

1009
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:26,319
reinvent many things in order to be able

1010
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:28,119
to accomplish that that task and and

1011
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,560
that's why I say don't be afraid to

1012
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,140
reinvent the wheel now with that said

1013
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,000
there's my fail I had to pull this out

1014
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:37,060
of the archives that was my first

1015
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,849
business white hat defense that's where

1016
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,220
if any was another fun fact my moniker

1017
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:45,099
Logan whd that's where the WH D comes

1018
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,629
from that company failed miserably you

1019
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:48,310
know there was we did not grow at the

1020
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,839
times it wasn't great I tried to

1021
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,580
reinvent things and it didn't work and

1022
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,619
I'm telling you this because not every

1023
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,529
time you try to reinvent something will

1024
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:57,200
it actually be

1025
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,760
a raging success there may be a time and

1026
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,980
I couldn't find the logo I really really

1027
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,330
wanted to my very first attempt at

1028
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,690
reinventing things was a computer

1029
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:09,620
company and that did not go well at all

1030
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:11,660
so you know here we are now going on 20

1031
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:13,490
years and the reinvention had to happen

1032
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:17,270
a few times to get to get to where we

1033
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:19,399
are there's some lessons so the fear of

1034
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,530
failing should not stop you from trying

1035
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,060
alright cuz I can tell you honestly if I

1036
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,680
had more time I set up here and tell you

1037
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,470
all the times I tried to reinvent myself

1038
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,690
for things that failed miserably but if

1039
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,669
you let that fear stop you then then you

1040
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:33,470
won't move forward but when you try and

1041
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:35,720
you succeed it feels so good and the

1042
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:37,970
success feels amazing but we often times

1043
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,290
stop because of fear we oftentimes don't

1044
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:41,540
move forward because we're afraid of

1045
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,910
that discomfort or putting ourselves out

1046
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:45,950
there okay so how can we apply this all

1047
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,060
to ourselves because I'm going on ten

1048
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,480
minutes and I want to make sure we have

1049
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:52,220
some Q&A time so first the first lesson

1050
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,020
if you remember it was indecision is

1051
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,970
worse than no decision so don't wait for

1052
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,380
the perfect circumstances I've heard

1053
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:00,500
people say this about everything in life

1054
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:02,780
you know all I'll go to school when I'll

1055
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,780
have kids when I'll change careers when

1056
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:08,420
and all of those wins or buts or ifs and

1057
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,400
with some life-altering circumstances

1058
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,810
that may never occur don't allow

1059
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,510
yourself to be limited because of

1060
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,100
external circumstances make those

1061
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:18,920
circumstances happen if you want make a

1062
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,319
decision to move forward being

1063
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,150
comfortable with being uncomfortable

1064
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,610
honestly is maybe one of the top and out

1065
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:28,280
of all the five I've learned more growth

1066
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:30,920
from allowing that to occur I mean I've

1067
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,090
had a 15 year friendship with Dave

1068
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:37,070
Kennedy and all he does is prank me I

1069
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:39,590
mean he actually modified the seat

1070
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:42,579
heater in his car and then invited me to

1071
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:45,530
dinner so he can burn my arse

1072
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:48,829
he put a freaking oven burner in the

1073
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:50,630
seat of his car okay and I had him on

1074
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:52,849
the podcast for like seven years as a

1075
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:54,589
co-host I mean he I consider him one of

1076
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:56,349
my closest friends and all he does is

1077
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:58,480
Tube use me it doesn't even make sense

1078
00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:00,650
it's like I had Stockholm Syndrome

1079
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,930
that's not the lesson I want you to

1080
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,950
learn okay I don't want you to learn to

1081
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,450
have Stockholm Syndrome

1082
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:08,000
don't don't have friends like that but

1083
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,799
what I mean is being uncomfortable in

1084
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,030
that situation helped me to grow help me

1085
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,470
to grow in the industry help me to grow

1086
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,940
with my team I'm gonna grow with people

1087
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,220
and I learned a lot from it and there's

1088
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,109
some valuable lessons there finding good

1089
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,149
people you know there's always people

1090
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:21,470

1091
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,030
matter what you do no matter how good

1092
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,680
you are no matter how many times you try

1093
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,910
to do good things there's always people

1094
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,040
out there they're gonna try to find

1095
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,960
fault with you do you know I had just

1096
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,560
went back and looked at some reviews of

1097
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,240
my first book and don't bother he's full

1098
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,578
of himself I never really got that

1099
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,049
complaint from any people but this guy

1100
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:40,700
wrote it so bad and I didn't put the

1101
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:43,310
rest of his review up there how about

1102
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:46,189
this one a waste of time like it's fat

1103
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:50,328
disgusting author well that's hurtful

1104
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:51,440
dang ouch a little bit you know but the

1105
00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:52,730
other one I couldn't put up there

1106
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,420
because it was just too long this guy

1107
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:58,099
actually wrote that the 350 pages of had

1108
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,430
nagi's books are stained with his

1109
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:05,210
masturbatory fantasies not kidding I'm

1111
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:10,250
matter how much good you try to do like

1112
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:12,319
giving out free education saving kids

1113
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:14,089
from predators trying to help the

1114
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,310
industry people will always find fault

1115
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:17,779
with you and you can't let that get to

1116
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:19,430
you I mean sure does this hurt yeah I

1117
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,810
mean you know I read these and I'm like

1118
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,419
okay yeah I can lose a little weight

1119

1120
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,410
disgusting you know I mean whatever but

1121
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,730
you know that you've read these things

1122
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:30,078
and it could be really hurtful and it

1123
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,520
could hurt your ego and I'm gonna say

1124
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,290
I'm joking about it now but sometimes

1125
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,839
it's really painful when you read this

1126
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,460
when people attack you your family just

1127
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,740
because of what cuz you put yourself out

1128
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,660
there don't let that stop you right

1129
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,640
surround yourself with the people that

1130
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,259
will tell you hey you know what that

1131
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,910
book had a few errors it really sucked

1132
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,290
but you know you did good here here and

1133
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,879
here you can improve by doing this

1134
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:52,700
that's the kind of people I want to

1135
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,619
surround myself with number four accept

1136
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,210
failure and then learn from it attaching

1137
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:57,650
your ego to anything you do

1138
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,570
their success or failure is always gonna

1139
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,220
lead you to disappointment right because

1140
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:03,349
if you if your egos attached to it

1141
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,970
you're gonna find that when you succeed

1142
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:06,740
it blows you up when you fail you're

1143
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,180
crushed you can't do that

1144
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,430
look at each thing is separate and not

1145
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,589
attached to who you are as a person your

1146
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:14,598
successes could define you so can your

1147
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:17,089
failures but it should not it should not

1148
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,550
define who you are as a person and then

1149
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:21,259
finally don't be afraid to reinvent the

1150
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,690
wheel and then we can even change that

1151
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,190
don't be afraid to reinvent yourself

1152
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:27,080
right let's look at where you are now

1153
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,910
and say in five years here's where I

1154
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:33,230
want to be what do I have to do to

1155
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:35,500
reinvent me okay now this is some time

1156
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,730
for Q&A there's all my contact details

1157
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,170
it's a great thing for a social engineer

1158
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:46,670
to do anybody want to ask questions

1159
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:47,690
about anything yes sir so the question

1160
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,670
was when was the first time I was

1161
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:53,330
putting handcuffs and I got out without

1162
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:55,070
using the letter it's kind of a hard

1163
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:57,200
it's kind of a I don't know if this is

1164
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:59,839
gonna answer you because I what I did is

1165
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,310
I used the fake letter so I got hired by

1166
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,440
a company that basically told me when

1167
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:04,609
they hired me that they did it just so

1168
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,550
we can come and fail because they needed

1169
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:08,960
to check a box and that to do it they

1170
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,410
basically mail you a letter in a sealed

1171
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,930
envelope

1172
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:14,118
if the envelope was unsealed then I

1173
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,580
broke the contract so what I did is I

1174
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,740
unsealed the envelope was steamed and I

1175
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:20,299
scanned the letter and I wrote my own

1176
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,220
stuff in the middle which basically said

1177
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,619
that if you catch this guy you're one of

1178
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,629
our elite security guards so take him to

1179
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:28,250
a conference room and then call this

1180
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:30,680
number to report yourself and write your

1181
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,580
badge number on here and and so I walk

1182
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,319
in the building I knew I was going to

1183
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,880
get caucus that everyone got caught so I

1184
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,700
got caught got cuff and I'm like hey in

1185
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,990
my pocket there's a letter so he pulled

1186
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,490
the letter on unsealed the envelope

1187
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:45,020
started reading it soon as he got to the

1188
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:49,310
point about being elite he did this and

1189
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:52,220
I said I'm in it's done right so he

1190
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,630
takes this pan out he writes his badge

1191
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,189
number on the letter and he's like come

1192
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,080
with me I'm like I can't really do much

1193
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,000
else so I follow him and go to the

1194
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,799
conference room he leaves to go call

1195
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,619

1224
00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:00,410
like leaning on a rack taking selfies

1225
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,460
this guy comes around the corners like

1226
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:03,440
hey what are you doing here I'm like

1227
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:06,890
Tony said I can be in he was like ok

1228
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,300
cool girls to say that company never

1229
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:09,920
hired us again they thought I cheated

1230
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:12,550
but you know hopefully that answers your

1231
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:30,430
answers your question

1232
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:33,680
anyone else yes sir can I have an hour

1233
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:36,919
ok the question was how do we CSE being

1234
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,500
used by attackers and defenders so if I

1235
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,819
can answer the attackers quickly

1236
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:43,069
phishing is on the increase huge

1237
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:44,750
increase phishing is being used in so

1238
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:47,750
many more attacks than it was a year or

1239
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:50,740
two ago and I think the statistic that I

1240
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:54,020
read was something like over 80% of all

1241
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:56,660
be EC or spear phishing type attacks are

1242
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:59,240
now using social media tidbits social

1243
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,950
media knowledge from for the target so

1244
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,109
that means the attackers are now doing

1245
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:05,240
more o sent they're perfecting their

1246
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:06,890
craft they're writing good spell checked

1247
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,200
and grammar checked emails unlike that

1248
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:10,790
sentence and they're using attack

1249
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,220
vectors that are a lot more intelligent

1250
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:16,609
and realistic from a defender standpoint

1251
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:18,558
I think what proves this and you know

1252
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:20,270
this is a whole nother topic is the

1253
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,490
increase in the amount of social

1254
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:22,910
engineering courses I remember when I

1255
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:25,189
had

1256
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,629
only SE course out there I mean it was

1257
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,190
like three years at blackhat there was

1258
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:29,930
no one else teaching social engineering

1259
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,789
and now you look down the list and it's

1260
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:34,730
like I see this I see this I see this I

1261
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:38,150
see this defenders are saying hey we

1262
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:40,089
need more so people start teaching me so

1263
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:42,140
we're seeing more and more increase in

1264
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:43,970
social engineering being part of

1265
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,650
education which is why you know this is

1266
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,779
a shameless plug but why I started the

1267
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:49,670
se village conference which is up there

1268
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,619
in February because what I wanted to do

1269
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,170
was bring together some of the best in

1270
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:56,510
the world to educate the defenders and

1271
00:46:54,170 --> 00:47:05,240
those who want to use se to better their

1272
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:20,299
careers in their life you can I'll give
