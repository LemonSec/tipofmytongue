00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,330

our Derby to recontact this is our very

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:25,590
first Derby con and our very first

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:28,830
organized talk we are gonna talk to you

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,109
about shadow ITU in the cloud but first

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,579
a little introduction so I started I

9
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,829
grew up in the Army as an intelligence

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,140
analyst I spent another 10 ish years in

11
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,870
the DC area working for I'm different

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,200
Intel missions up there before I decided

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,370
I needed to maybe consider the

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,140
possibility that World Peace might break

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,879
out and I should find a new career so

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,940
along the way I got a bachelor's a

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,980
masters degree and information assurance

18
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,370
and then I joined USAA I started in the

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,870
Sauk about nine years ago and it kind of

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,120
worked around different teams since then

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,438
now I'm on the team responsible for

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,590
cloud security among other things and

23
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,630
I'm Marissa Dyer actually personal note

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,610
recently married but told my husband

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,189
that the dog was cuter so she made it to

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,080
the presentation I've been at USA a

27
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,289
little over six years I've done a couple

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,908
things software development sysadmin

29
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,530
currently though I'm serving as our one

30
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,869
of our cloud security engineers and so

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,150
we're working to manage and secure our

32
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,250
workloads that USA is using in the CSPs

33
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,490
and that includes AWS Microsoft Azure

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,340
and GCP and came straight from college

35
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:39,658
out from the University of La Paz so in

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:43,950
in El Paso Texas and came straight to

37
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,329
USA from there I'm so you say we always

38
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,259
start with our mission slide and so we

39
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,309
thought we'd share that with you guys

40
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,990
I'm use I use a a exists to facilitate

41
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,880
the financial security of our military

42
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,610
members right and so then on the cyber

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,949
security side we exist to ensure the

44
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,380
data security for our members and our

45
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,659
employees because we know that the

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,030
military folks aren't going to trust us

47
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,979
with their their money and their

48
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,949
business if we can't protect their data

49
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,349
so we really are here to ensure that

50
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,439
we're protecting that data so that

51
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:17,839
that the company can achieve its mission

52
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:22,549
of helping the military achieve

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,230
financial security so we have an agenda

54
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:27,469
slide because all good presentations

55
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,599
have one I've been told we originally

56
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:31,310
wrote this talk for a less technical

57
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,679
audience so some of these things will

58
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,209
skip over in the interest of time but we

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,459
just want to talk about it a basic level

60
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,930
what is shadow IT we'll probably skip

61
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,299
over what is a cloud I think everybody

62
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,609
knows that here and then when you bring

63
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:45,889
those two things hat together what what

64
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:47,480
amazing things can happen and then we'll

65
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:52,489
talk about some strategies to help you

66
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,379
address that in your organization's so

67
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,939
it's just mentioned we've we have used

68
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,709
this comp presentation at other

69
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,840
conferences and we've submitted it to

70
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,419
other conferences right technical

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,669
non-technical and we've actually been

72
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,239
honored to be chosen for places like

73
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:06,590
derbycon

74
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,989
to be able to print present this stuff

75
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,689
to you guys but we have gotten some

76
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,949
rejections and this is actually some

77
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:14,328
feedback that we wanted to share with

78
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:15,290
you all in a rejection that we got so

79
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:18,079
I'm gonna go ahead and read it out for

80
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,370
y'all your proposal sounds immature you

81
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,590
make the assumption that your IT

82
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,900
department is unaware of what is being

83
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,790
used and downloaded and somehow your

84
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,509
data is in someone else's hands

85
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,429
love you thank you thank you I'm so glad

86
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:33,379
that that hit home okay so if you know

87
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,620
what shadow IT is which obviously we do

88
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:38,629
that's the the feedback on why they were

89
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,299
direct rejected us is the definition of

90
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:42,709
shadow IT so the biggest thing we want

91
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,900
you to take away from this if nothing

92
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:48,560
else is just an awareness of what shadow

93
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,049
IT is and that it probably does exist at

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,790
your your company or your place of work

95
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:54,949
and it's just something we need to be

96
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,078
aware of so we can be aware of those

97
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:59,389
risks and vulnerabilities and then know

98
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,770
how to protect ourselves against all

99
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:04,660
that stuff

100
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,790
and then just some stats around shadow

101
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,829
IT again you guys probably know or

102
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,370
familiar with a lot of this stuff I mean

103
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,740
over 80% of users admit to using tools

104
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,298
and applications that they didn't try to

105
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,549
get bedded through IT or security

106
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,320
because that process sucks and because

107
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:21,700
security are the know people and so I'm

108
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,200
not gonna go and talk to them and have

109
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,240
them turn me down or make me go through

110
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,860
some lengthy process and so yeah they'll

111
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,480
admit that yeah I've used a lot of stuff

112
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,490
I swiped that corporate card and started

113
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,840
using some trial and I forgot I started

114
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,630
using it two years ago and that's just

115
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,789
been charging up on there right some

116
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,920
common shadow IT is like bring your own

117
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,870
device right you're plugging something

118
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,240
in that's foreign to the network or

119
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,550
hasn't been vetted or using a device

120
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,260
that is it managed by security so we

121
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,580
have no idea if it's on the latest

122
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,680
version or it's getting all the patches

123
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,770
and upgrades and so it's it's got those

124
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,540
vulnerabilities communication apps huge

125
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,789
history of companies being attacked via

126
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,130
those free chat sites right for the user

127
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,660
it's super easy for them to just go into

128
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,580
that chat site helps them get their work

129
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,230
done they can just share this code with

130
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,520
this person and that person but they

131
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,340
don't know who actually owns and manages

132
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,200
that data right or they're sharing this

133
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,460
code or this sensitive information we

134
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,960
don't know that they're using this app

135
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,609
at all so we don't have any deal P

136
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:20,289
monitoring on that we have no idea

137
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,610
what's going out there so and everybody

138
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,040
here knows what the cloud is I won't

139
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,180
spend too much time on this slide I will

140
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,160
point out though that when your

141
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,080
executives talk to you about what are we

142
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,419
doing for cloud security they mean SAS

143
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,430
in addition to your I as M has right and

144
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:34,719
as a security person I hear what are we

145
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,190
doing for cloud security I'm thinking oh

146
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,750
well we've got these guardrails in place

147
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,060
for AWS and we're doing this code

148
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,030
scanning and it's ass to me is just

149
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,050
contractual controls but it's not really

150
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,669
there's some additional security

151
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,290
controls you have to have in place and

152
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:49,120
your executives when they're talking

153
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,340
about the cloud need to understand what

154
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,560
you're doing for SAS in addition to high

155
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:58,840
as impasse and so when we talk about

156
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,880
shadow IT in the cloud right we go from

157
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,830
nightmares to night terrors right where

158
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,100
before I just had an unpatched laptop on

159
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,229
my network now I might have business a

160
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,820
business unit that stood up in s3 bucket

161
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,229
using their corporate card so I have no

162
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,520
idea that it's out there and they went

163
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,570
and created their own account it's not

164
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,760
even inside

165
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,710
organizational tenant and maybe they

166
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,719
made it read/write/execute to the world

167
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,419
right and they're serving a website on

168
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,190
static country serving static content to

169
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,560
a website from that s3 bucket no these

170
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,000
are all hypothetical situations just I

171
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,250
should have said that up front right

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,900
these are this would never ever happen

173
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,090
in your organization or mine

174
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,159
right but now there's a website with

175
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,049
static content that's read/write/execute

176
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,880
well that's cool you're taking customer

177
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,010
traffic there but what happens if bad

178
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,870
guy decides to host his static content

179
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:48,400
in your s3 bucket as well and now you're

180
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:50,590
serving malware to your customers or lab

181
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,450
accounts right a lab account is still an

182
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,849
account in your clout your

183
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,800
organization's cloud footprint and Brian

184
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,320
Krebs folks is not going to care when

185
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,330
your lab account gets compromised and

186
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,580
you say oh it's just lab it's not proud

187
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,710
right he's not gonna care he's still

188
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,930
gonna write about you and not the nicest

189
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:12,609
way or like Marissa talked about using

190
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,650
corporate cards to stand up accounts in

191
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,510
the cloud they forget about it they

192
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,070
never deploy it right so they some

193
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,140
developer went up and spun up a whole

194
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,050
bunch of resources never tore it down

195
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,130
and six months later what you know what

196
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,550
does that do to your organization's

197
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,250
budget and this is one of my favorite

198
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,860
ones so this is more of a SAS type

199
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,830
application write code beautify our

200
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,020
sites are my personal favorite because

201
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,580
every developer wants pretty code right

202
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,620
and so they just go paste their code

203
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,450
into whatever code beautify our site

204
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,730
they find and it makes it nice and

205
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,010
pretty for them but they never read the

206
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,290
EULA which says that the content they

207
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,000
posted up there now is MIT common

208
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,640
license and all of your intellectual

209
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,190
property now belongs to the Internet so

210
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,020
thank you developers right on the

211
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:03,790
internet we appreciate that but for your

212
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,680
organization probably not so much so

213
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,600
what do we have to do right zero trust

214
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,070
we heard Nicole previously talk about

215
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,290
zero trust from the application

216
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,420
development standpoint we have to

217
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:16,390
explicitly allow and deny everything

218
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,620
else him I am in the cloud and Marissa

219
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,229
is going to talk about this a little bit

220
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,240
more in detail but I am especially in

221
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,430
your eye ISM has really is your new

222
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,930
network boundary so you have to have

223
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:31,160
leased privileged access

224
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:33,680
Cosby's are good for SAS solutions right

225
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,530
Cosby is really just DLP for your SAS

226
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,059
providers or SAS applications and they

227
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,850
allow you to do an examined web traffic

228
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,099
and identify those cloud users and I

229
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,530
think probably you could go a step

230
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,030
further there and combine a Sat Cosby

231
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,130
was something that's scanning purchase

232
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:52,670
orders and invoices and corporate cards

233
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:55,070
and to identify cloud usage that's not

234
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,189
been not gone through any type of

235
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:00,200
approval process and then governance

236
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,420
around new use cases right so as we're

237
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,370
all looking to deploy to the cloud there

238
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,099
should be some type of approval process

239
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,450
that says hey I've got this use case and

240
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,490
I think it would be really cool in the

241
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,380
cloud but maybe I've got a VM on Prem

242
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,000
that could serve it just as well it

243
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,710
doesn't make sense to introduce the risk

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,850
of putting that into the cloud when we

245
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:22,070
can provide solutions for that on Prem

246
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,170
an employee training right

247
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,360
just like your developer doesn't think

248
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,870
of that code beautifier site as a cloud

249
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,000
application that he's posting is data to

250
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,010
I'm sure any other of your users are

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,840
just as confused when you talk about

252
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:39,560
software purchasing and software and the

253
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:45,020
cloud counts as software and then

254
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:47,660
scanning corporate card data yeah so

255
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,400
like just mentioned I'm gonna go into

256
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,020
kind of some detail on some things you

257
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,790
can do from a security perspective right

258
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,050
to make sure that you're protecting

259
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,910
yourself and your company from these

260
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,740
kind of risks but the biggest thing to

261
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,390
me is like I said earlier awareness and

262
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,980
then training right making sure that

263
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,990
people know exactly what they're doing

264
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,000
why maybe you're making them go through

265
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,710
the process of like a cloud review panel

266
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,820
or something to get that approval for

267
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,990
their whatever their business

268
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,800
justification is and along with that is

269
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,740
developers and making sure they have the

270
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,150
training as well so not just why we're

271
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,070
allowing you to use the cloud or not use

272
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,079
the cloud but what happens when you're

273
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,820
actually in there when you stand up a vm

274
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,800
we have an ec2 and you have that s3

275
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,990
bucket and you know so people are going

276
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,459
in there kind of playing it's fun it's

277
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,750
lab and they want to just get started

278
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,550
and kind of run around in the cloud

279
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,530
because it's a new cool thing I get it

280
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,599
right it is fun and it is

281
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,040
but it's knowing and having that

282
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,380
training to know okay when I stand up

283
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,420
this instance these are all the things

284
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,300
that get stood up with it these security

285
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,400
groups these ec2 instances this network

286
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,469
security group what are my defaults what

287
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,660
are those look like right do I have some

288
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,520
crazy zero zero zero zero rule open

289
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,959
somewhere and so knowing that whole

290
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,910
process and then again going back to

291
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,770
they leave stuff open and don't close it

292
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,380
down well maybe they did but they didn't

293
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:02,449
realize when they oh I terminated my ec2

294
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,530
instance but I didn't know that I still

295
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,330
had all these security groups and

296
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,670
everything else open right so again that

297
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,650
training just really is the first to me

298
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,449
the first line of defense to making sure

299
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,240
before anybody's even out there that

300
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:16,640
these folks know exactly what's going on

301
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,890
so again once you already in there this

302
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,800
is just some things you can do sit at a

303
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:24,170
proxy level right we have a proxy rule

304
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,170
that's looking at and these these are

305
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,750
examples from USA these are rules that

306
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,849
we're using we these are sites so we

307
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,100
call it our shadow IT sites right these

308
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:37,040
are blocks for sites that we either know

309
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,630
are malicious can be malicious or SAS

310
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,640
sites that haven't even been vetted but

311
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,620
we've either seen somebody use them or

312
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,270
we've been made aware of them or we use

313
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,700
scanners that can actually look for

314
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,620
sites like that we just create an object

315
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,160
list add those sites in there as needed

316
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:54,170
and then our rule blocks that the access

317
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,360
to that external URL for our users and

318
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,430
so you go a step further again you know

319
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,220
our users are doing this kind of stuff

320
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,449
shadow IT stuff because they just want

321
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,860
to get their work done right they're not

322
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,630
trying to be malicious they're not

323
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,130
trying to hurt the company they just

324
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,900
want to get the work done as fast and as

325
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,570
quickly quickly and easily as possible

326
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:15,170
and so we want to help them too so we

327
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:17,270
create a defined exception a specific

328
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,099
exception that kind of tells them what

329
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,390
we're blocking and why we're blocking it

330
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,890
and what they can do if they actually

331
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:26,600
have a business reason to get that

332
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:28,460
opened up so again this is an actual

333
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,530
example of what we show at USA whenever

334
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,380
somebody hits a site on that shadow IT

335
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:37,459
block this will show again that their

336
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:39,230
site is blocked for a specific reason so

337
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,589
it's because we see that you're going to

338
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:45,290
a cloud application and so if you have

339
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,850
actual business purpose for using this

340
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,560
here's a request you can submit blah

341
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,020
blah blah and then we get the tech

342
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,880
details to us that actually help us look

343
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,319
at the logs and say okay did they get

344
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,600
the block we think they're getting for

345
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,860
the reason we think they're getting it

346
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,870
what's their source all that kind of

347
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,240
good stuff and so this helps both sides

348
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,470
right you know again it tells them that

349
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,640
we're trying to help them out but we

350
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,530
just need to look at some stuff first

351
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,300
and go through some processes and then

352
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,010
sometimes maybe they're gonna see this

353
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,420
and go ah never mind I'll use some other

354
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:16,060
app that I know is already allowed right

355
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:19,520
another quick example at the proxy level

356
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,780
so you know of course the proxy we're

357
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,780
gonna we're looking at everything going

358
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,930
into external traffic right so we have

359
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:29,810
specific ad groups that define users

360
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:33,620
that have access some business purpose

361
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:36,290
for hitting a sure right so first off an

362
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,630
IM level they have to be a part of that

363
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,640
group that ad group once they're part of

364
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,260
that ad group then on the proxy we have

365
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,090
a rule that says okay we stay at you're

366
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,100
part of this crew which narrows it down

367
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,260
to only the users and employees that

368
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,750
have a business justification for using

369
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,670
Azure right so you're in this group

370
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,890
you've been allowed here's the sites you

371
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,150
can hit and now you can get to Azure and

372
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,590
even once you're in there there's still

373
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,689
more iam policies and things that are in

374
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,680
place for your subscriptions and

375
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:06,920
resource groups all that kind of good

376
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:09,109
stuff and then another example this

377
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,290
one's at the I am level is sam'l

378
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,950
Federation so something is simple in as

379
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,599
high level as blocking any connections

380
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,010
that are outside your network right so

381
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,480
the users assigned to this group and you

382
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,490
can see that it takes priority here so

383
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,530
it's gonna look at the first rule first

384
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,320
take that action then go to the second

385
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,939
so first priority users a sign of this

386
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,620
app so it means they have access here

387
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,050
but they're not in our zone they're not

388
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,970
in our network deny I don't care who you

389
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,829
are what you have access to you're

390
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,420
coming from an external IP you're not in

391
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:43,149
our internal network you're out right

392
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,680
and the last example this one's specific

393
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,760
to AWS if you guys know a little bit

394
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,888
about ATS you know that they have

395
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,260
service control policies or scps and

396
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:51,820
again very high level this is a simple

397
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,860
one that you can put in place that we've

398
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,589
put in place for region restriction and

399
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,329
so all this does again super simple we

400
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:00,850
know that our users don't have any kind

401
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:03,670
of reason why they would need to use AWS

402
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,889
regions outside of the US so we have an

403
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,500
SCP in place that denies everything any

404
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:10,420
kind of usage services a crown creation

405
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:17,680
or resource creation anything outside of

406
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:19,449
any of the u.s. regions so when you in a

407
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,399
security organization when you're

408
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,920
getting ready to or examining your cloud

409
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:25,690
infrastructure it can be a little bit

410
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,209
overwhelming right where do I start how

411
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,250
do I approach this how do I you know

412
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:32,410
build durable teams to address these

413
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,490
issues I'm a couple of things we thought

414
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,110
we'd share with you that we're really

415
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,600
helpful to us the cloud security

416
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,889
Alliance has a cloud controls matrix if

417
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,570
you're not familiar with it definitely

418
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,269
go check it out and so they break down

419
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,490
and for all of the different control

420
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:46,990
domains and they tell you what security

421
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,490
controls you should have in place and

422
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,230
then they tie it back to regulatory

423
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,970
requirements which makes it really easy

424
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,070
as you're not only building out the

425
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,250
technical and administrative controls

426
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,440
themselves but also working on building

427
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,120
out your audit documentation if you're

428
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,740
in a regulated environment like we are

429
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,540
building out your controls and control

430
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,430
tests and all that documentation to

431
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,610
share with the regulators being able to

432
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:11,019
tie each control back to the specific

433
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,910
regulatory requirement is super helpful

434
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:14,410
and the Cloud Security Alliance has done

435
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,839
all that work for you so definitely

436
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,870
leverage that and then this notion this

437
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,610
one is AWS specific and so AWS has on

438
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,699
their website they've got an F if I see

439
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,350
an audit handbook for AWS that tells you

440
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:28,569
exactly what the auditors are going to

441
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,310
come in and look for and then linked off

442
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:32,260
of that same page is a link to a

443
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,849
spreadsheet that again does almost the

444
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,519
same thing except this one is tailored

445
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,889
specifically to AWS and it tells you

446
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,510
what AWS will do for a control and what

447
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:43,149
you and the shared responsibility model

448
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,470
are responsible for and then ties it

449
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,690
again back to the different security

450
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,360
control frameworks and regulatory

451
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,190
requirements so don't don't reinvent the

452
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,840
wheel leverage the resources that are

453
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:56,430
out there for you

454
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,510
and then this is kind of how we've

455
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:03,209
structured our approach to I as at USAA

456
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:05,369
so at a very very top level right first

457
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,020
you should just define what cloud

458
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:09,540
services you're gonna offer to your

459
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,490
environment or to your company right you

460
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,310
shouldn't just open up AWS or Azzurro

461
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:17,310
GCP and tell the developers hey go wild

462
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,829
right bad things are gonna happen so

463
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,750
build out a Service Catalog right these

464
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,790
are the things that you can have an AWS

465
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,349
right now and next quarter will have

466
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:28,050
these additional services available to

467
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:30,000
you but definitely have a defined

468
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,550
catalog of what you're gonna offer and

469
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,480
offer them only once you have security

470
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:38,669
controls in place for those services

471
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,950
governance controls this is absolutely

472
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,050
critical right if you are putting

473
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,390
applications in the day in the cloud if

474
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,399
you're storing data in the cloud your

475
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,740
sizzle is responsible for the risk

476
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,110
associated with that data in those

477
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,030
applications and you have to have a big

478
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,490
picture view of everything that you have

479
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,970
in the cloud so having those governance

480
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,590
controls in place having a decision

481
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,760
point yes this application go to the

482
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,770
cloud no it can't

483
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,110
yes this data can go to the cloud as

484
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,790
long as it's encrypted or tokenized or

485
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,229
how this data is above the

486
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,909
classification level that we've decided

487
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,860
is allowed in the cloud sorry you need

488
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,590
to stay on Prem right but having that

489
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,560
control gate in place and formalized in

490
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,800
your organization is absolutely critical

491
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,360
that should be backed by a cloud policy

492
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,250
you know how many companies have have

493
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,870
taken the time to write a cloud policy

494
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,790
yeah right but that's one of the things

495
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,639
that you have to have in place I'm in

496
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:35,520
order to enforce the rules that you're

497
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,590
trying to implement and we'll kind of

498
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,870
skip around Marisa talked about

499
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:43,530
preventative controls asset management

500
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:45,330
is huge right not just from a security

501
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,010
you know I work in the vault management

502
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,659
team and I have to know which what

503
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,440
servers are out there so I know what to

504
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:55,080
Vulcan and what I need to patch but on

505
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,000
the billing side right how many how many

506
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,500
developers have spun up resources and

507
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,090
not torn them down and now on the

508
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,670
billing side we're absolutely getting

509
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,169
crushed every month when that AWS or GCP

510
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,780
bill comes in

511
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:10,080
and then on the software side right if

512
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:12,420
we're deploying applications and I have

513
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,159
to write custom rules to allow this app

514
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,320
to talk to the Internet but not this app

515
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,150
or you know this server to talk to their

516
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,740
app but not the server without that

517
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,290
asset inventory being able to tie it

518
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,790
back to the resources you know we're

519
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,260
just opening everything up to everything

520
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,920
and it's not going to be it good at the

521
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,410
end of the day I am controls are really

522
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,050
again the boundary of the of your cloud

523
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:36,120
environment so you have to have core

524
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:39,389
controls on who can do what in the

525
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,300
internet or in the cloud and practice

526
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:45,000
the least privileged policy now we

527
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,889
talked about a CPS as a binary controls

528
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,500
yes you can do something or no you can't

529
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,840
MSC peas are like your firewall rules

530
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,150
for the internet they're you know very

531
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,949
clear yes you can talk to the internet

532
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,430
no you can't yes you can deploy in this

533
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:02,430
region no you can't these are very

534
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:06,330
critical critical layer in your cloud

535
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:08,580
security deployment model and then on

536
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:12,000
the assurance side and we've been very

537
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,260
fortunate to have some talented folks

538
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,850
that have written a lot of custom

539
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,470
scripts to go out and scan our cloud

540
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,330
environment looking for miss

541
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,780
configurations for those public s3

542
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,699
buckets for those servers that have Asus

543
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,980
HR already P open to the Internet right

544
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,680
because we're blocking it as proxy level

545
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,840
so you can't get there from on-prem so

546
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,630
you have to have that assurance function

547
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,209
in place to find those things that are

548
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,070
kind of going around your policies am i

549
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,510
dealing you're deploying infrastructure

550
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,310
is code everything is going through a

551
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,050
pipeline you've got your terraform

552
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,090
modules or your cloud formation or

553
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,919
whatever you're using so that everything

554
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,500
all the security checks are done in the

555
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:52,410
pipeline but we all need that just in

556
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,650
case secure surance function just to be

557
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,650
there

558
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,809
any questions

559
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,110
hi folks argue here

560
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,260
unfortunately grams and province table

561
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:12,120
talks and the audio ends here and is

562
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,019
gone from the rest of the video sorry

563
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,018
for the inconvenience

564
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,040
you
