1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:09,240
all right everybody hear me good okay

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:12,780
my name is Jameson vedecci information

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,070
security architect fortune 500 company

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,669
been there for about eight years almost

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,760
before that I was a senior engineer at a

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,289
fortune 100 tech firm this is my first

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,130
time presenting at Derby con so I'm

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,130
pretty excited about that

9
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:30,869
thank you for your thunderous applause

10
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,308
so the main point here is we're going to

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,190
tell you a little bit about the history

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,019
of our tabletop exercises what what went

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,760
well and what didn't

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,079
we're also going to share some templates

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,550
with you to help jump start your own

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,690
tabletop exercises

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,550
yeah it's a lot it's a big pain so I

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,968
think it's a lot of that mumbo-jumbo out

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,968
of the way basically but practicing

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,449
incident responses tabletop exercises is

21
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,649
kind of all about understanding

22
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:01,769
weaknesses in people process and

23
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,390
technology and to help inform and

24
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,850
educate other departments not

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:10,200
necessarily an information security so

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:13,559
what is a tabletop exercise yeah it's a

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,900
lot of words so what is it really it's

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,710
really discussion based it's meant to

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,850
simulate an emergency helps what people

30
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,580
understand their roles and

31
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:27,179
responsibilities test response

32
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,100
procedures also looking to test

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,340
predefined objectives before you even

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:37,079
start makes use of realistic content and

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,360
it has to be relatively cheap so what

36
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,899
really is a tabletop exercise kind of

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,070
based off that long definition but

38
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,340
before we get there let's talk about a

39
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,199
little bit of history in 2017 the

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,640
information security team did a group

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,290
led tabletop exercise by a large

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,329
financial services group with other

43
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,189
companies in it it was kind of a

44
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,380
one-size-fits-all it was their first go

45
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,389
at it and it kind of left a little bit

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,939
to be desired but the good news is in

47
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,619
2018 we use that as a source of

48
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,508
inspiration to create the choose your

49
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,660
own tabletop exercise model that we're

50
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,799
going to talk about in 2019 we went back

51
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,750
to the group level

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,580
mostly because priorities and work

53
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,550
schedules and takes a little bit of time

54
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,140
to do these but the group did take a lot

55
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,270
of feedback from the various companies

56
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,859
and it was a little bit better still

57
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,970
wasn't great it lacked a little bit of

58
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,130
personalization obviously but as we know

59
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:35,850
tabletop exercises as a whole we're kind

60
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,710
of linear very boring lacked the

61
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,560
substance that kind of makes that you

62
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,120
see on a day-to-day basis and the

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,360
reality did not really live up to the

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,100
expectations so a lot of times we

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,980
expected to get a unicorn and we ended

66
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,310
up getting a donkey so that's the reason

67
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,989
why we decided to make our own so like

68
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,850
the famous philosopher Mike Tyson always

69
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,680
says everybody has a plan until they

70
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,900
gets punched in the mouth this is

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,640
particularly true is you have to have a

72
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,470
plan before you even do anything and

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,260
even you have that plan and the heat at

74
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,460
the moment you may it may not go well

75
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,799
but it's more than just a plan it's a

76
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,850
practice we practice a lot of things in

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,340
life whether it be sports exercise I'm

78
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,859
going to volunteer firefighters so we do

79
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,720
a lot of training when you go to a car

80
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,190
accident you have to have plan a in mind

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,130
if that doesn't work you have to have a

82
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,320
plan B C and D in mind as well so we do

83
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,540
this a lot for various topics but we

84
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,890
don't really do it well and do it enough

85
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,690
for Incident Response so why is that

86
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:39,869
time various things could come into play

87
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:43,079
but the tabletop exercises are a great

88
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,900
great way to start that so like I

89
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:50,100
alluded to earlier our history and

90
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:54,209
tabletop exercises not that much a big

91
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:56,430
group situation one size fits all and we

92
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,130
felt pretty empty afterwards but like I

93
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,480
said it did motivate us to do something

94
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,070
better for the team and create the

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,750
choose-your-own-adventure tabletop so

96
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,760
what are some of the prerequisites

97
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,690
before you even start a tabletop

98
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,720
exercise obviously you have to have a

99
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,969
plan for us we have our C cert handbook

100
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,738
and play books so our handbook is our

101
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,810
high-level policy about what the C cert

102
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,760
team does how instant response works and

103
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,370
our play books are more

104
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,440
compasses rather than maps for new team

105
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,700
members and individuals on the team to

106
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,830
give them an idea of things that they

107
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,210
should be doing next it's not a

108
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,440
one-size-fits-all it's not going to get

109
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,530
everything out of the way but it gives

110
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,920
them heads in the right direction your

111
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,320
team might know what to do but it's also

112
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,210
important for the team to know what not

113
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,380
to do

114
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,810
lastly because you don't want to panic

115
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,400
time and time again people who have read

116
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,290
the plays read the play books they

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,489
understand everything ever they're the

118
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,380
heat of the moment during an incident

119
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,300
they panic and they start to do things

120
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,980
that they think might make sense Bennett

121
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:04,050
but may not so we're a financial

122
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,240
services company we like to route

123
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,890
everything in best practices I like to

124
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,800
say we try to make use of other smart

125
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,680
people's work and this is no exception

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,320
we found the miters cyber exercise

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,810
PlayBook by Jason kick it's a great

128
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,090
short read it highlights various three

129
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,310
different types of exercises you can do

130
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,440
obviously the tabletop is here but the

131
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:30,270
other one is a hybrid which involves

132
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,160
live actions aka injects these can be

133
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,859
scans probes and alerts that go on in

134
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,720
the environment and the most mature is a

135
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,240
full live which is a red team versus

136
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,160
blue team situation but getting back to

137
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,850
the tabletop and what we liked about it

138
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,790
was that it's fully scripted and it's

139
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:51,120
used makes use of injects the complexity

140
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,250
is relatively low and it's good for

141
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,800
limited resources one thing to call out

142
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,170
is the timing it said it would take one

143
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,000
to two months to plan it and one to two

144
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,520
days or one to three days to execute

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,620
that is absolutely true I originally

146
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,729
thought I was going to be able me and

147
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,710
another resource we're going to be able

148
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,300
to do this in one week plan it out but

149
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,489
it took a month and a half it takes a

150
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,960
lot of work and it's a lot that was

151
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,300
probably the most surprising thing that

152
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,219
I came across it also matched our

153
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,370
organization that we're new to tabletop

154
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,080
exercises and we wanted to kind of

155
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:27,630
really test our processes that we had in

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:30,060
place so the first step after that is to

157
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,700
establish a goal so our goal was pretty

158
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,300
basic it was to create a baseline for

159
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,400
future exercises

160
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,640
to raise the awareness of what c-cert is

161
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,780
and what we do as well as to test the

162
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,580
skills of our employees objectives as

163
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,580
you can see identify strengths and

164
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,159
weaknesses assessor IR reporting so this

165
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,440
is a key one here at the time our

166
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,820
Incident Response platform was new this

167
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,560
is the way we keep track of all of our

168
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,050
incidents and it was very new to the

169
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,720
team we wanted to be able to measure

170
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,110
communication as well as identify any

171
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,160
sources of data gaps that we may have

172
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,650
think about these when you're creating

173
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,300
your scenarios as well they're called

174
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,890
pain points and if you're picking on a

175
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,270
certain area you may want to think about

176
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,340
it and bring it to help bring it to

177
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,719
light now we also wanted to train the

178
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,580
effectiveness of our internal training

179
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,690
of how we onboard move employees are

180
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:25,000
they understanding how things work

181
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,890
people involved there's a long list a

182
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,440
couple that I'd like to pick out here is

183
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,789
crisis prevention management that's kind

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,340
of the notion of partner with somebody

185
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,810
in a different area in the company that

186
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,599
either has done this before or has a

187
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,250
unique perspective for us the crisis

188
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,260
prevention management team they do

189
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,060
tabletop exercises quite a bit they're

190
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,610
not cybersecurity related they're more

191
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,930
active shooter bomb threat related so

192
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,600
they have a little bit of experience in

193
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,610
this I would also say to have three to

194
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,220
four scribes during the process just

195
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,500
dedicated scribes they are there to take

196
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,750
notes of the things that happen and that

197
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,580
you really got to key them in to where

198
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,350
the decisions are going to be made and

199
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,690
they can take really good notes and that

200
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,630
helps up quite a bit

201
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,580
lastly make sure strategic

202
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,980
communications and physical security and

203
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,880
our case are there because we decided to

204
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,430
pick on them a bit

205
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,200
we had our tabletop involved physical

206
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,450
security as well as communications and

207
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,760
ironically enough we didn't invite

208
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,380
anybody from strategic communications

209
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,770
until a couple days before the exercise

210
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:29,200
it's kind of a Miss on our side lastly

211
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,810
two people should run and host the

212
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,179
tabletop exercise so in our situation as

213
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,190
myself and my colleague we kind of

214
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,650
created the tabletop scenario so we knew

215
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:42,400
about it so it would be unfair for us to

216
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:45,880
participate but these two hosts do not

217
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,529
participate at all so when we get into

218
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,029
the adventure build out there

219
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,410
some main points that we're going to

220
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,819
talk about coming up I want to talk

221
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,980
about those pain points these help

222
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:56,110
really help you make your scenario the

223
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,629
operational environment these are pretty

224
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,740
basic room setup make sure everybody can

225
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:01,389
hear everybody make sure there's enough

226
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,899
seats make sure everybody sees

227
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:04,329
everything

228
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:06,519
projectors things like that some of the

229
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:08,199
core ingredients for the tabletop this

230
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,209
is kind of when you get into the the PM

231
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:13,240
area and a lot of that mumbo Jumbo's

232
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:15,638
referring to earlier and lastly we

233
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,370
created this notion of alternate reality

234
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,300
alternative realities they were if you

235
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,139
make a good decision

236
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,519
you'll get a hint or you will be told

237
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:26,470
some information that helps you along in

238
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,689
your investigation whereas if you make a

239
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,249
bad choice you may cause more work for

240
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:38,139
yourself and you may not get that hint

241
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:40,600
so pain points were pretty simple we

242
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:42,490
wanted to route them in data or facts so

243
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,899
we wanted to use real-world hacks that

244
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,939
were going on in the industry or

245
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:48,699
anything at the time I believe it was

246
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:51,309
social media takeovers in 2017 of

247
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:53,079
entertainment companies as well as any

248
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:57,189
previous incidents that may have popped

249
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:59,199
up during your during the past for us it

250
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:01,719
was a production site being affected by

251
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,579
an outage also you want to mix in

252
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,860
feelings or perceptions so think

253
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:09,219
business nightmares what are some of the

254
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:11,860
things that will be very detrimental to

255
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,470
your company for us it was a new one it

256
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,019
was a maybe this may be the news media

257
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,970
finds out that the company's been owned

258
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,290
how would we react to that that made a

259
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,040
lot of people pretty squeamish

260
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,689
and lastly push past the limits of

261
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,209
comfort that's one example but also

262
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:29,949
incorporate physical security you may

263
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,540
not be getting all the data that you can

264
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:33,819
get and this would be a good opportunity

265
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,980
to highlight that and show hey if this

266
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:42,069
data was available we devolve people to

267
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:43,839
get to the solution quicker operational

268
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:47,529
environment like I alluded to room

269
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,959
layout play nice with others follow the

270
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:51,670
rules do your part these are some other

271
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,888
key aspects that we talked about before

272
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,689
we started we specifically said the

273
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:59,220
incident response platform is

274
00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:01,439
operational and ready to use the

275
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,189
team can can and should make use of any

276
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:07,620
c-cert play books or handbooks normal

277
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:09,240
team facilities are available this is a

278
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,850
very important one two questions can be

279
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,750
answered of the hosts of the tabletop

280
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:18,029
but not all questions may be answered to

281
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,040
the two of the senior more c-cert

282
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:22,649
resources were off-site at a work event

283
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,180
and not easily accessible you can mix

284
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,759
this up however you want you can say the

285
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,709
CSO is not available at the time so

286
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,810
you'll have to operate without them or

287
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:33,540
the second line manager is not available

288
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:37,378
so if operate without them and also most

289
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,000
importantly anyone can be anyone

290
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:40,560
available can be involved so you can

291
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,660
pick up the phone and call somebody in

292
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,619
IT operations if you have a question and

293
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,860
they can help you out

294
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,420
and we actually pre-selected some people

295
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:54,240
and gave them some information just in

296
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:55,979
case if they were to call so into those

297
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,029
core ingredients some of the paperwork

298
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,889
things rooted in best practice The MITRE

299
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:04,529
best practice even some NIST even though

300
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:06,720
it's more dr tabletop exercise but

301
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:08,660
there's still some value there the

302
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,740
Charter this is kind of the the main

303
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,850
document it really lays out your

304
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:16,350
background purpose objectives

305
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,379
participants and any project milestones

306
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,720
the next thing to do is create an

307
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:24,120
outline of the scenario and then build

308
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,100
that into a script then from that script

309
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,230
you create a flow diagram which will

310
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,000
show next and that will really kind of

311
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,559
highlight some of the key points where

312
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,480
all those alternate realities can come

313
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,730
into play where good information or bad

314
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,740
information can come in and really kind

315
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:42,870
of key those scribes into those points

316
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:45,959
to take really good notes hot wash is

317
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,939
kind of a simple way to ask repetitive

318
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,189
questions during the various aspects of

319
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:53,370
the exercise so some of these questions

320
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:56,660
are what action did you take what core

321
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,529
InfoSec principles are being affected

322
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,750
confidentiality integrity or

323
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,910
availability what other teams did you

324
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,949
get involved at this point what do you

325
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,600
do next this is a great way to get the

326
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:08,569
thought that's going on and all the

327
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,100
people that are participating out

328
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:13,540
and onto paper and the scribes can

329
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,540
really kind of pick up on those two

330
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,920
lastly is follow-up so a survey is

331
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,719
another good one if I've learned one

332
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,360
thing from taking classes in the

333
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,420
volunteer fire department is do a quick

334
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,310
survey on paper five questions one

335
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,979
open-ended question and get it to them

336
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,060
and collect it before they leave don't

337
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,120
let them leave until you get that

338
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,260
otherwise you won't get the information

339
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,330
another good thing is the after-action

340
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,280
report we've kind of broke it down as

341
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,570
one after-action report for the large

342
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:47,150
group and a subset for the InfoSec team

343
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,410
as well as any lessons learned so the

344
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:52,970
lessons learned are really crucial for

345
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:54,319
making yourself better the other thing

346
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,960
that we wanted to try to attempt was

347
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,780
create an exercise application if you

348
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,030
will nothing crazy but not PowerPoint we

349
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,860
kind of wanted to really kill the notion

350
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,420
of using the PowerPoint because we felt

351
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,310
at the time that that's what was driving

352
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:13,280
a lot of the linear thinking that we had

353
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:16,040
so once again the alternate realities

354
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,959
good choices lead to bonus that choices

355
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,439
lead to potentially punishment or more

356
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,940
work once again really kind of tell the

357
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,250
scribes where these are going to be and

358
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,750
the adventure map that you'll see next

359
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,840
would really show those and highlight

360
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,820
them and tune them into it so the

361
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,080
adventure map it's quite simple not sure

362
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,490
how well you can read it once again this

363
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,650
is all part of the template that you'll

364
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,260
be able to get as well as slides if

365
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,060
necessary so you create your outline you

366
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,740
make this flowchart it's critical to

367
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,449
show the points where you anticipate any

368
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,910
of those realities and really tune the

369
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,620
scribes into so you can at the start you

370
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,439
can have your back story you can have a

371
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:56,900
typical day it's not a clock in the

372
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,700
morning an alert comes in and they take

373
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,620
the alert and do something with it then

374
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,750
somebody comes in and says hey from the

375
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,670
marketing team there's a real incident

376
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,560
going on I need you to investigate this

377
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,000
and then the question can come up did

378
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,189
they follow the proper chain of command

379
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,350
if they did yes you can see that goes up

380
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,150
and no they didn't and if they did yes

381
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,779
the incident management team would be

382
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,610
involved and this is a way you

383
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,499
bring other teams into it to give a

384
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,079
briefing of what they do what's their

385
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:23,999
role if they don't that comes in at the

386
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,649
end anyways and it's known that they

387
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:27,749
missed it but they still have the chance

388
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:31,620
to give their input the other team and

389
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:34,499
tell them what's going on the adventure

390
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,980
app it's really simple it's just basic

391
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:39,959
HTML super simple super quick to use

392
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,149
we've actually figured out a way to do

393
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,050
this in PowerPoint now too which kind of

394
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,110
defeats the purpose of killing

395
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,870
PowerPoint but this is this was easy for

396
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,149
for for me and an intern to to you know

397
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,910
get a handle on as you can see kind of

398
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:56,089
layout the day things start the day

399
00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:00,089
starts the sock begins to be stood up

400
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:01,499
they get a notification you can make it

401
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:05,370
interactive you can give them a handout

402
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:07,920
here comes the notification it's oh look

403
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,629
it's a lot of the things that we see on

404
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,399
a day to day basis you can ask some of

405
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:13,800
those hot wash questions what steps did

406
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,110
you take what are you doing next then as

407
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,089
the story progresses you can see the the

408
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,899
InfoSec team received notice from senior

409
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:23,519
marketing specialist and they begin to

410
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:25,319
investigate the problem once again those

411
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,939
hot wash questions come in what did you

412
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,189
do who are you getting involved

413
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:30,750
what are gonna do next during that

414
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:32,069
questioning they said well it looks like

415
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,420
this is potential incident so we're

416
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:34,949
gonna follow the chain of command which

417
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,199
is a really basic thing in the

418
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:38,490
high-level policy you get the question

419
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,889
did they follow the proper chain of

420
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:44,579
command and it was a turns out to be a

421
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:48,449
yes the story progresses even further

422
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:51,000
and the the CEO and CIO are walking and

423
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:52,758
the news crew ambushes them and asked

424
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,529
them about the recent cyber attack and

425
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,480
asks if any customer information has

426
00:16:55,529 --> 00:17:01,050
been affected in it so since they did

427
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,689
choose the proper chain of command the

428
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:07,648
CEO is he I knew about it and say no

429
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:09,209
comment which ironically is exactly what

430
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:11,969
you're not supposed to do according to

431
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,350
our marketing team and we're like what

432
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,669
you mean that's exactly what I do and

433
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:17,129
they said no you're supposed to say

434
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:19,370
please contact so and so at the the

435
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,209
marketing part and the corporation and

436
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,589
we're like we didn't know that and they

437
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,600
said well it's on our internal website

438
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:26,369
and it's the number one story right now

439
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,159
and oh okay good to know

440
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,449
so don't

441
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,760
like you know everything because you

442
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,410
definitely don't so the good piece of

443
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,780
information that came along with this

444
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,000
too is they didn't get it you didn't get

445
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,649
a negative reaction a call from the CEO

446
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,590
CIO yelling at you

447
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,710
but you also find out that Facebook and

448
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:48,409
Twitter have been compromised Instagram

449
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,110
is okay and the reason Instagram is okay

450
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,780
is because of two-factor authentication

451
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:55,550
was enabled if they chose if they didn't

452
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,080
follow the proper chain of command they

453
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,210
wouldn't have got the bonus the bonuses

454
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,760
that third line there it's a hint for at

455
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:05,060
the end once again what would you do

456
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,940
with this information so during this

457
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,649
result how did the team do we did a

458
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,900
pretty good job of identifying some

459
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,490
strengths and weaknesses we did not use

460
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,700
the incident response platform so that

461
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,320
was kind of a miss it was a brand new

462
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,210
tool for the team and may not have

463
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,730
thought of it we didn't do a great job

464
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:26,990
of measuring communication there's

465
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,670
various anecdotes for that as well but

466
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:32,780
we did do a good job in finding some

467
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:35,750
some identifying data gap data gaps that

468
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:39,530
we have and we did train our test our

469
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:41,480
training effectiveness quite a bit so

470
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:45,230
some of the outputs that will be

471
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,660
available within the templates are a

472
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,910
sign-in form detailed notes this is a

473
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,740
really good way for the scribes to make

474
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:56,240
use of things a sample survey ad hoc

475
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,040
feedback is another thing that we got

476
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,900
from it so a great example is from the

477
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,820
marketing team they said hey that would

478
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:06,230
never have happened and the after-action

479
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,450
report some of the lessons learned it's

480
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:11,240
a lot of work so plan for it even in a

481
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:14,660
tabletop it says it's going to take one

482
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,950
two months and it will the planet you

483
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,310
know learn from all the other

484
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,470
individuals involved aka the teams that

485
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,940
you picked to partner with crisis

486
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,700
prevention management and even marketing

487
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,440
so I miss on my part was that we didn't

488
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,120
involve them quick enough and we could

489
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,400
have had much more valuable information

490
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,659
from them that with the trusted source

491
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,460
once again

492
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,410
you used somebody in the organization

493
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,910
that has done this before or knows a

494
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,200
little bit more about it doesn't have to

495
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,210
have anything to do with cybersecurity

496
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,480
either

497
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,950
lastly

498
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,110
build the story all the way through

499
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,880
recovery because we kind of went through

500
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,959
and we got everything remediated and

501
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,389
then we just kind of stopped the

502
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,580
exercise we didn't go through of how are

503
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,408
you gonna recover this the system or how

504
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,850
you're gonna recover the social media

505
00:19:54,409 --> 00:20:02,330
accounts so we kind of fell short of

506
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:04,100
that future stuff we want to do more

507
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,049
with this style we want to improve and

508
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,269
get more to a hybrid model do more live

509
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:11,090
injects make better use of our tools

510
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:13,700
obviously and then have a notion of a

511
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:16,279
surprise tabletop so maybe have a set

512
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,110
week or set month time period and give

513
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,029
one person the ability to push the

514
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,639
button to say that hey the tabletop is

515
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:24,320
live now rather than it being an invite

516
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:28,399
on a calendar and it can be well planned

517
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,529
it'll be more of a realistic test also

518
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:32,360
push the team more into cloud incidents

519
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,590
and automation of those incidents so the

520
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,928
typical things that you're going to see

521
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,418
your you know account credential

522
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:40,130
compromised resource compromise that

523
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:43,820
could lead to crypto mining and any

524
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,840
publicly available asset lastly a couple

525
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,939
minutes left

526
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,908
templates are available here on github

527
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,190
here's the link if anybody wants it

528
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:55,220
they'll also I'll probably tweet this

529
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:59,690
later so it can be out there lastly from

530
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,149
Black Hills just this today black back

531
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,279
doors and breeches was released for the

532
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:06,979
the Derby Cup Kong crowd seems like a

533
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,690
pretty cool deck salade Ecch it might be

534
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,880
another great source of information if

535
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,860
not you can use it as a source of

536
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,630
inspiration for your injects as well and

537
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,418
I think it's going to be in public

538
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:20,630
release in January or December coming up

539
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:24,289
here but uh that's the information that

540
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:26,000
if you want to take it down and four

541
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:39,169
minutes left if anybody has any

542
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:42,679
questions good that's a good question so

543
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:44,779
we had the predefined team sure thing

544
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,399
the question was something along lines

545
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:48,769
did you have everybody in the room or

546
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:53,330
are you adding people as things popped

547
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:55,190
up correct okay so we had a predefined

548
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,500
meeting invite classic

549
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,750
kind of tabletop thing we had probably

550
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,850
about 40 different people in the room so

551
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,700
we part of our intention was to over

552
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:06,230
invite as well to get more knowledge out

553
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,870
there but yeah we had it kind of all

554
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:17,600
scripted once again very tabletop driven

555
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:28,669
so all right thank you look one more

556
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:30,230
question okay so the question was how

557
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:32,300
did you manage 40 people in one room

558
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,160
that's one of the things that we talked

559
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,930
about is the environment is we have a

560
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,270
big conference area a big conference

561
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,170
room and we were able to facilitate that

562
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:44,810
many people we had up we actually had

563
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:47,060
seven to ten big roundtables and it's

564
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,560
kind of a big bigger meeting area so we

565
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,909
made use of that and we had a projector

566
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,770
and everything that we just projected

567
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,960
everything and handouts were given as

568
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,850
needed so that's another thing to think

569
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,680
about is that the list is going to grow

570
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,620
we originally started with maybe 30

571
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,540
maybe you know 25 to 30 and then it grew

572
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,129
to 40 plus because people would invite

573
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:14,360
people so you have to take into account

574
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:16,730
for that as well no more the question

575
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,560
was have you used the Department of

576
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,390
Homeland Security's templates at all we

577
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,389
did look at those to begin with they

578
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,100
were also kind of looked at but we kind

579
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,510
of wanted to create something that was

580
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:37,790
more true to us they're also a great

581
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:39,850
resource as well to use all right thank

582
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,850
you

583
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,099
[Applause]
