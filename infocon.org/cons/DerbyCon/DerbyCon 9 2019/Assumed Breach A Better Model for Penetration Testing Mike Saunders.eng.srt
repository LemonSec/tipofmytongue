1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:15,699
what's that what do you what do you got

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:18,130
there all right we are ready to go so I

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:20,740
am Mike Saunders and today I want to

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,479
talk to you about assumed reach pen

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,779
testing why I think it's a better model

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,610
for pen testing there's a link here

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,770
that's really hard to see because I

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:33,219
failed to contemplate that surrett siege

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:35,649
calm slash ABM I'll show it at the end

10
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:36,670
of the talk and you can see it there but

11
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,130
that's where you'll be able to get a

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:41,560
copy of this slide deck that I'm showing

13
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,440
today so read see calm slash ABM and you

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,850
can get the slides so it is a little bit

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,980
about me I am oh that's terrible I am a

16
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,780
principal security consultant with red

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,779
siege I've been an IT a while I've been

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,210
in security for a while and I like to

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,860
fish and play guitar and as you can tell

20
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,100
by my voice I like to smoke a lot of

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,100
cigars

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:22,560
oh no I don't that is terrible it's like

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,289
worse ice all right pentesting is broken

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,610
if you know me you know I'm prone to a

25
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,200
little bit of hyperbole so I'm not

26
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,750
saying all of penetration testing is

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,270
broken but what I'm saying is that what

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,820
we do with internal pen test isn't

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,360
working they don't represent how real

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,460
attackers operate so how do what are we

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,860
doing internal pen test we drop a box on

32
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,720
the network and so we're sitting with

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,950
some machine that an attacker probably

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,510
doesn't have on the network because it's

35
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,030
got Kali or whatever and all our tools

36
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,190
on it and we've run a bunch of noisy

37
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,750
scans we're in mapping and nessa singh

38
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,310
and doing all the things we're lobbying

39
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,510
exploits everywhere trying to catch

40
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,950
shells and that is valuable don't don't

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,570
get me wrong and saying that there's not

42
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,070
value in doing this there is value we

43
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,440
need to find those issues we need to get

44
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,449
those issues fixed for real attackers

45
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,450
aren't doing this and so consequently

46
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,440
our customers aren't being prepared for

47
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,209
what they're going to see in the real

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,220
world so pen testing this model is

49
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,570
broken in the aspect that it's not

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,150
preparing our clients for what they're

51
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,519
likely to see out there on the other

52
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,580
side of internal pen tests is I want a

53
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,500
red team let's see so are some executive

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,030
went to a shiny conference and someone

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,130
told them you need a red team and

56
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,120
they're like I want a red team and you

57
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,500
talk to them you like you don't really

58
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,989
want a red team because like I want a

59
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,810
red team this is out of scope this is

60
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,880
out of scope it's only external and it

61
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,980
has to be done in a week and that's not

62
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,290
how proper red team should work if we're

63
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,350
gonna get now pedantic here a proper red

64
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,390
team is like a false scope blended you

65
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,850
know blended threat type of assessment

66
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,410
where if the easiest way for me to

67
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,970
achieve the goal is to throw a rock

68
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,070
through your window and grab whatever

69
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,989
sitting on the other side that's what

70
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,989
I'm going to do I'm not going to be

71
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:09,209
using the latest you know tradecraft and

72
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,269
burning O'Day's if I can use something

73
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,489
simpler red teams are much different and

74
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,709
much more complex than a pen test as a

75
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,840
result they are necessarily expensive

76
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,280
because they take time so they're not

77
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,890
appropriate for a lot of client budgets

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,080
and they require a lot of maturity in

79
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,329
our IT organization

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,700
and to be able to get benefit from a

81
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:32,330
test like that otherwise we came in and

82
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,709
we looked awesome and maybe they fix

83
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,240
this one thing but there's this whole

84
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,540
host of other problems that are out

85
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,250
there that still aren't being fixed so

86
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,769
that's why I think assumed breach is a

87
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,360
better model assume breach starts with

88
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,220
the assumption that something in the

89
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,850
organization has been breached a user

90
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,950
has clicked on a link and they have code

91
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,410
executing on their machine or they've

92
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,030
given up their credentials the

93
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,010
organization is breached what can happen

94
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,560
at that point that's what an assumed

95
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,470
breach test is supposed to simulate so I

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,900
as a penetration tester doing an assumed

97
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,120
breach assessment have my client execute

98
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,520
a cobalt strike beacon or run sub tape

99
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,740
some type of code on their machine once

100
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,680
I have my check in I start operating

101
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,200
like an attacker might do and we do that

102
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,910
in two models we have our malicious user

103
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,798
model that's someone who's an employee

104
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,380
or a contractor that wants to steal or

105
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:27,500
cause harm and we have the compromised

106
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,800
user model and that's the model where we

107
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,970
have a user who has clicked on a link

108
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,080
they've got something running in their

109
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,740
browser they've given up their

110
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,590
credentials in both of these tests we

111
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,390
start with a standard workstation a

112
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,190
representative workstation image with

113
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,680
representative users what I mean by that

114
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:49,550
is if everyone in the company is running

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,880
a Lenovo excellent laptop if you give me

116
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,590
a VMware image to test from I don't have

117
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,880
the same hardware configuration and if

118
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,770
you've been reading up on the lenovo's

119
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,540
the think Vantage software has a nice

120
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,669
local privilege escalation vulnerability

121
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,470
in it in the assumed breach test

122
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:05,330
I would write that file that to direct

123
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,100
to that directory in ten minutes after

124
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,080
they reboot I would have privileged

125
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,660
access on the workstation but from the

126
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,250
VMware image I might not have that so I

127
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,660
can't simulate what would happen to

128
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,450
their users because I don't have the

129
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,760
same configuration by the same fact if

130
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,310
I'm trying to simulate what happens if

131
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,030
Bob and accounting clicks on a link I

132
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:28,220
should have the same group access that

133
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,250
bob has so that I can access the same

134
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,720
machines I have the same software and I

135
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,210
have the same rights and privileges if I

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,330
don't have that how can I possibly show

137
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:42,120
what happens when bob gets

138
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:44,409
breeched so a terminated user is a

139
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,759
recently terminated user is ideal

140
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,949
because those are users that were

141
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,789
actually out there in the wild if we

142
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,729
can't do that

143
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,318
we'll say copy a production user and

144
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,449
make that the user that we're going to

145
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,629
use and this is just a little soapbox

146
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:01,780
here DEA is a tool not a destination

147
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:05,139
it's just something we use to get to the

148
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,590
goal I'll explain more later

149
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:10,210
so the compromised user model we

150
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,698
simulated a user is clicked on a payload

151
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,138
and their Eve that payload is either an

152
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:16,569
HT a our something gives me code

153
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:19,479
execution or sometimes we do it where a

154
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:20,979
user has given me credentials most time

155
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,080
we do it with who's clicked on a payload

156
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:25,389
and has code execution we're executing

157
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,698
some custom payload and once we have

158
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,650
that code execution running we're

159
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:33,550
operating over our c2 framework for the

160
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:35,469
majority of the assessment however like

161
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,449
a real attacker would if I get

162
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:40,419
credentials after I have code execution

163
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:42,509
and it it benefits me to pivot to remote

164
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,068
access if I can VPN in and do something

165
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,169
directly connected their network I will

166
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:50,139
do that because that is something that

167
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:51,310
an attacker would do and I'm gonna have

168
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,020
creds I'm gonna pivot through the

169
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,310
network if we're doing the assumed

170
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,659
breach type assessment where we're

171
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,819
simulating what happens if someone gives

172
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:59,440
up their credentials I get the creds and

173
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:03,370
I try to figure out where can I go with

174
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,740
those creds and this is a question you

175
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:09,550
need to have with your clients should AV

176
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:13,659
or EDR be disabled that is a good

177
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,940
question so I think we got Nixon here

178
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:18,250
you gave a talk yesterday on bypassing a

179
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,569
V and EDR there's another talk today I

180
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,389
think it's actually going on right now

181
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:24,639
I'd like to be there honesty I tell you

182
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:25,990
that here's some cool stuff this is some

183
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,409
great stuff has happened in there so I

184
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,719
appreciate you all being here we can

185
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:34,560
agree I think for the most part that you

186
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:36,669
can bypass a V or EDR given enough time

187
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,919
the same thing with the assumed breach

188
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,448
assessment that's why we start inside

189
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:42,609
the organization because we assume it's

190
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:44,129
going to happen at some point so let's

191
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,300
make that assumption let's make the leap

192
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:49,120
should we be spending our time trying to

193
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,440
bypass a V or EDR there is value to the

194
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,160
client in knowing that it can't be

195
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,500
bypassed and

196
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,970
how it can be bypassed but those are

197
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,160
really kind of point in time things and

198
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,900
then the vendor makes a fix that bypass

199
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,020
doesn't work but another one will work

200
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,030
is so is it worth the clients dollars to

201
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,250
spend our time trying to get bypass for

202
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,880
their particular solution that is not a

203
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,800
decision I can make that is an option

204
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,560
that I can present to the customer and

205
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,810
have that discussion with them knowing

206
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,430
the malicious user user model I'm gonna

207
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,290
simulate an employee who wants to steal

208
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,240
or cause harm so I'm going to be an

209
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,250
employee so I'm gonna have an employee

210
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,740
machine I'm gonna test on-site or

211
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:30,430
remotely through a VPN or the customer

212
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,169
might ship me a laptop and I start with

213
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,610
their standard workstation again the

214
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,280
same machine that that employee would

215
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,530
have and I use whatever tooling is

216
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,419
available on that machine so I don't

217
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,829
have cobalt strikes so I can't execute

218
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,870
power shell on memory at this point

219
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,690
because a regular user is not going to

220
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,670
set up a C - most of the time espionage

221
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,770
they might do that but that's not the

222
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,870
case we're talking about here so what

223
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,150
can I do with whatever is available on

224
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,550
that machine I'm not gonna bypass are

225
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:00,300
not gonna ask them to disable aviary TR

226
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,709
or whitelist my payload I should back up

227
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,439
when we're talking about this I'm not

228
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,990
talking about disabling AV or EDR across

229
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,210
the organization it's only allowing my

230
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,480
payload to run on the initial host after

231
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:16,330
that point everything is still in scope

232
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:20,170
or whatever they have for EDR in Obion

233
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:22,990
scope for the malicious user model now

234
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,939
I've said real world a couple of times

235
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,410
probably what do I mean by that like

236
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,050
what is actually happening in the real

237
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,969
world when we talk about the apt du jour

238
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:35,500
I don't know what the latest one is but

239
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:38,860
you know it's the soup of the day come

240
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,620
on all right so apt dessert a you know

241
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:45,280
apt 2934 or 75 whatever the numbers are

242
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,320
what are they doing and I think I've

243
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,939
read enough analysis talk to people that

244
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,190
are smart in this world that live in

245
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,290
this world the DES tackers aren't

246
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,630
burning the latest tradecraft they have

247
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:59,860
on every client they're only using it

248
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:02,080
for select targets so if they can get by

249
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,460
just like on a red team I mentioned

250
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,870
throwing a rock through a window if

251
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,850
putting password

252
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:12,279
works and they get in that is a

253
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:14,680
perfectly valid test so you have assumed

254
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,100
breach isn't like one sophistication

255
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,500
level

256
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,270
it's whatever sophistication level

257
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,700
you're trying to emulate for your client

258
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:26,110
which could be from very basic to very

259
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:28,210
complex one is researching the talk I

260
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,839
came up on this blog from the mandiant

261
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,990
red team and in this case the client

262
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,700
said we want you to get to these goals

263
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,830
we want you to start remotely officially

264
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,690
user get access into the network and

265
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,460
then here's a few different systems and

266
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:45,430
data that we want you to get access to

267
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,110
and this blog lays out a likely

268
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,069
real-world attack scenario that we've

269
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:52,300
seen played out in real incident reports

270
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,000
they start with phishing they get

271
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,459
credentials from a user they found a

272
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,720
mobile VPN solution that didn't have to

273
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,970
factor because all the rest of the

274
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,970
organization's VPN had to factor but

275
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,620
because they were able to actually like

276
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,779
wrote a phone and then route all their

277
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,260
traffic through that VPN they were able

278
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:12,520
to get in without having to factor once

279
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,740
they're in they did some targeted

280
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,209
Kerberos ting got elevation of privilege

281
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,950
and started pivoting through the network

282
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,660
going towards data and accessing

283
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,910
high-value targets and that's the same

284
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,469
thing that we try to do and we're not

285
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,180
unique in doing that ever at sea there's

286
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,610
lots of other companies that do this

287
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,839
it's just something that we do but we

288
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,920
don't hear enough people talking about

289
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:35,320
it when we're doing a test when I'm

290
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,910
doing one I am trying to simulate a

291
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,880
payload being sent to a user and I

292
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,589
fished them or I social engineered them

293
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,740
into clicking it that's that's the

294
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:45,850
premise once I'm on the network I'm

295
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,050
doing the same thing that Mandy was

296
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,880
talking about I'm searching out

297
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,380
high-value targets usually one of the

298
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,230
first things I'm going to do is Kerberos

299
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,630
just so I can get those tickets on the

300
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,940
cracker as soon as possible it says

301
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,959
usually take a while and the entire

302
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,990
assessment I'm trying to gather

303
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,420
credentials for the purpose of getting

304
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,959
to the data I'm getting to the things

305
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,660
that matter and again DEA is a tool not

306
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:14,020
a destination if I can do everything I

307
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,850
need to get the data that the client

308
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,319
wanted me to get to and we know that

309
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,730
because in the scope and Colin and the

310
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,589
initial talks we say what keeps

311
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,440
you up at night what is the one thing

312
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,899
that if an attacker got to would cripple

313
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,709
your business that's the thing that we

314
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:31,779
want to get to and once we know that's

315
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:35,229
our target that's what we start reaching

316
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,269
for during the assessment and DA is just

317
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:41,769
a way to get there because our entire

318
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:43,779
job is to demonstrate impact and tallest

319
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:47,050
technical people saying yeah I owned the

320
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:49,930
domain we demonstrated impact however to

321
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,579
the people that hire us the people that

322
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,560
pay the bills the people that set the

323
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,410
budgets to fix the problems we find

324
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,719
they're like okay that's cool what does

325
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,839
that mean however if I can show on a

326
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,600
report here's all your your patient

327
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,300
databases with all kinds of PII our pH I

328
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,279
or here's an unencrypted credit card

329
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,199
numbers or here if I click this one

330
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,449
button right here I will complete a ten

331
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:16,209
million dollar wire transfer out of your

332
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:18,969
organization that demonstrates impact

333
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:23,109
I don't need da to get there but it's

334
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:25,990
just a tool to get me there so one of

335
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:28,149
the things that we do is domain fronting

336
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,089
now unfortunately if any of you use

337
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:32,470
domain fronting you know that CloudFlare

338
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,300
and others have been starting to ruin

339
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,760
the party we can no longer route our

340
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,550
traffic through someone else's domain

341
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,339
before June with cog fair CloudFlare I

342
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,050
could take certain domains like Cisco

343
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,029
comm if they were if my customer was a

344
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,810
Cisco shop there were some frontal

345
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:51,850
domains in Cisco comm that I could route

346
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,369
through cloud front to my own endpoint

347
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,399
and so therefore I can blend in with

348
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,690
traffic that's likely to be seen

349
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,420
unfortunately that's not working on all

350
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,519
the CDs anymore it still works on some

351
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,099
but if you analyze any traffic at a

352
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,139
customer's site you will see that you're

353
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,970
going to you have host calling out to

354
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,620
cloud front and Azure edge so we can

355
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,649
still route traffic through those CD

356
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,260
ends back to RC to what we want to make

357
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:19,930
sure that traffic is hidden with some

358
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,699
level of sophistication if we're using a

359
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,069
default cobalt strike or some other see

360
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:25,599
to their traffic is pretty heavily

361
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:26,649
signature it's gonna stand out pretty

362
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,120
quickly if you know what you're looking

363
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:33,449
for it that's whatever c2 framework

364
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,120
we need to we need to try to obfuscate

365
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:38,849
that in cobalt strike that's malleable

366
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,920
see to profile and blue screen of Jeff

367
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,040
Jeff Demick from Specter ops if you've

368
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,689
ever read his stuff on malleable c2 and

369
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,139
just in COBOL strike operations in

370
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:52,709
general he's brilliant you can use the

371
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:56,370
malleable c2 randomizer right there in

372
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:58,199
honest github to generate one on the fly

373
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,699
but I would recommend if you're trying

374
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,490
to be more sophisticated actually

375
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:07,319
creating your own c2 profile on each

376
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:10,079
engagement so how do we simulate that

377
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:12,469
initial access on a test I'm going to

378
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,469
finish this

379
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,810
last year I had the spicy v8 and I

380
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,240
didn't know you had to shake it I was

381
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,069
like this isn't bad I got to the bottom

382
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,460
third of the can I was like I've made a

383
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,460
horrible mistake

384
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,319
so the initial access HTA's are still

385
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:37,020
effective we find that they still work

386
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,950
for getting access into people's

387
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:43,020
organizations now you can generate an

388
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:46,380
HDL to a COBOL strike but you're not

389
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,510
likely to get very far with it but there

390
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:53,700
are some other methods that you can use

391
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:56,730
to generate an HD 8 is effective this

392
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:59,190
blog article here incorporates the next

393
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,870
three tools down below and it still

394
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,910
works against some AV and EDR

395
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,580
essentially what you do is you generate

396
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:08,699
a PowerShell command out of COBOL strike

397
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:12,839
which is encrypted and it looks funky or

398
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,370
encoded and you decode that you rip out

399
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,339
a certain part of that you do some

400
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,170
further decoding at which point you take

401
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,870
that PowerShell script and feed it to

402
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:25,979
unicorn and the unicorn makes some

403
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:28,709
obfuscated scripts that makes your PS 1

404
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,420
less likely to get caught but then we

405
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:32,880
can take a step further and use Daniel

406
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,579
Bohannon's invoke obfuscation to further

407
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,580
obfuscate that PS 1 I would take me

408
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:41,730
Shang and use this out HTA to create a

409
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:44,970
new HTA and so we now have a much more

410
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,630
obfuscated HTA that gets past some of

411
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,570
the Avs

412
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:51,089
and EDRs defender unfortunately is

413
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:53,459
catching it if you follow this as its

414
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:55,220
laid out today but there are others that

415
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:58,829
it still works very effectively on

416
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:02,520
another one is Demi guys and Demi guys

417
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:06,780
the essence of how it works is your HEA

418
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:09,619
is encoded it's encrypted and it's

419
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,839
delivered in JavaScript on a page and

420
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:15,270
Demi guys looks for environmental keying

421
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,980
factors on the workstation that it's

422
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,589
executing on so it looks at one IP

423
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,510
address and what domain name am I on and

424
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,399
if those things match then it will

425
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,869
decrypt the payload but it won't decrypt

426
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,970
the payload before so anything that's

427
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:28,639
looking at that HT a on the wire whether

428
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,810
you mail it in

429
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,810
where the client is reaching out through

430
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,790
a proxy will just see some encrypted

431
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,560
data it won't see that there's an actual

432
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,170
hea in there until it's in the browser

433
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,730
and decrypted in memory which might give

434
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:44,810
you a better chance getting past

435
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:47,020
defenses macros still work in a lot of

436
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,020
places

437
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:58,169
click once executables net Spy has a

438
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,299
great article on that on creating click

439
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:02,100
once executables and there are so many

440
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,840
more other options this is not meant to

441
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,279
be a comprehensive list this is just

442
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,090
meant to be some of the ideas that you

443
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,710
can use to get that initial execution

444
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,139
[Music]

445
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:15,450
now as we're operating it's unlikely

446
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:17,309
that the account that we start with will

447
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,710
be the count that gets us to all the

448
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,269
data we need sometimes it might but

449
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,919
usually we're gonna need to find ways to

450
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:26,659
pivot through other accounts to get

451
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,659
access to different parts of the network

452
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:35,220
one that is terrible and so how do we

453
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:38,610
find those accounts so beau Bullock Daft

454
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,799
hack brilliant so many different tools

455
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,600
in his github that I use on a regular

456
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,500
basis I'm like thank you fo thank you so

457
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,350
male sniper

458
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,820
how many anyone used male sniper got a

459
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:53,730
few hands that's good anyone written

460
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:57,389
both male sniper in here no okay

461
00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:00,299
alright so male sniper I can spray

462
00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:03,719
against Oro 365 either internally or

463
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:06,019
externally and I can do a password spray

464
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,460
to get user names that I can use for

465
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:11,490
user names and passwords that I can use

466
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,860
within my c2 framework whatever I'm

467
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,740
doing to try to now spawn a beacon on

468
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,029
another machine is another user

469
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,309
internally I can use domain password

470
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:23,220
spray and I can make it low and slow so

471
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:26,490
I didn't stick out less one nice effect

472
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,529
of using a domain password spray is that

473
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,330
it will check to see how close the users

474
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:31,860
are to being logged out before it starts

475
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,340
and if they're within one failed login

476
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,469
of getting locked locked out it won't

477
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,620
test them so that's nice

478
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:43,769
we don't cause problems curb roasting

479
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,658
Tim Medine created this and it's still

480
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:46,590
magic most of the time unless I think

481
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:49,740
about it really hard and then it's

482
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,299
definitely magic the traditional tools

483
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,220
in Kerberos things still work great so

484
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:57,480
you've got power of you you've got Tim's

485
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,039
tools that he released Brian Furman full

486
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,639
metal cache another Black Hills employee

487
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,440
I has this on his github this invoke

488
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:05,879
auto Kerberos which is especially nice

489
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,289
because it spits OH

490
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:09,908
things in a format that worked directly

491
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:11,769
in hash cat if you use things like

492
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,419
invoke Kerberos you need to massage they

493
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:15,039
did a little bit it to make it work in

494
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:17,919
hash get this just spits it out just

495
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,710
nice the problem with all of these

496
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,480
approaches is that it's not how Kerberos

497
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,619
works in the real world in the real

498
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,389
world when a user wants to access a

499
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:29,649
sequel server it says hey I want to

500
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:31,899
access this service there's this

501
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:34,178
exchange of tickets at which point the

502
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:36,279
user can now access the service then

503
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:37,869
while later user says I want to access

504
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,700
this other service over here and they go

505
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:41,439
through the same exchange and access

506
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,779
that service when we're doing all of

507
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,419
this we're saying give us every single

508
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:48,850
ticket for every spin that's in Active

509
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:50,580
Directory all at once which is not

510
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,109
normal behavior so it's something that

511
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:58,359
defenders can look at certain event

512
00:20:53,109 --> 00:21:01,239
ideas like 4769 wasn't anyone know the

513
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:03,668
number forty seven sixty nine yes so

514
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:05,769
4769 is a sign that someone has

515
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:07,450
requested a ticket if someone requests

516
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:10,080
twenty five of them in five seconds

517
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:14,619
that's a sign that you've got a pen test

518
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,239
so what what Manion did when they did

519
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:19,029
their test was this low and slow

520
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:21,340
approach they targeted specific users

521
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:23,710
for instance groups that had admin in

522
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,899
the name or groups and had sequel in the

523
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,929
name and there's some ways you can do

524
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:30,248
this you can use it using Power View and

525
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:32,950
role traders talked about it on this

526
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,279
blog here curb roasting without Munich

527
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,139
ATS

528
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,970
the essence of it is that you do get

529
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:39,668
domain user to SSP an so you find out

530
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,679
all the users that have spins and then

531
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:45,580
you press them request them individually

532
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,529
with get domain SPN ticket and you can

533
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,269
do that in a low and slow approach

534
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:51,580
ideally with some jitters so you're not

535
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:53,019
requesting once a minute maybe you

536
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,759
pressed one and then you request one

537
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:56,259
three minutes later and then two minutes

538
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,049
later and then five minutes later until

539
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:01,659
you've got them all and that's Shawn Mac

540
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:03,489
Castro site right 80 security yeah so

541
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:05,320
eighty Security org he's got an article

542
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,090
that he talks about it there so you can

543
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,039
read up on that again I'll put the link

544
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,419
you're downloading the slides at the end

545
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,030
of the talk

546
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,670
another thing I like to do is mine

547
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,100
Active Directory and if you've ever used

548
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,360
bloodhound or char pound you know how

549
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,490
great it is for getting information

550
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,860
about Active Directory and where you

551
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,540
need to go if you're using cobalt strike

552
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,540
sharp hound works really nice because

553
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:30,159
you can use execute assembly and execute

554
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,230
that completely in memory on the clients

555
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,540
it never touches disk but you need to

556
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,520
research the stealth options because

557
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,680
this is noisy so if you're trying to not

558
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,200
get caught or trying to yeah

559
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,400
not going to come it's probably not

560
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,750
gonna work out real well for you make

561
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,220
sure you have multiple beacons as

562
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:49,060
different users because that one's

563
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:51,970
probably burned another thing that I

564
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,580
have no idea why this works but I know

565
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:57,790
it does I've seen it in action his

566
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,379
mining Active Directory schema for

567
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,840
sensitive information like credentials

568
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,870
if you look if you've ever used AD

569
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,310
Explorer you look at a user and you see

570
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,629
that they've got a description and a

571
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:10,050
comment field and they have maybe a

572
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,950
bunch of different scheme attributes

573
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,010
sometimes especially in large

574
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:17,020
organizations things like the helpdesk

575
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:20,260
will put information about what they're

576
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,450
doing in one of those schema fields for

577
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,700
a user especially with service accounts

578
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,130
but like reset the password to blah and

579
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:30,160
it's in the schema so you can see it in

580
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:32,140
80 X 480 Explorer online you're just

581
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,940
doing a graphical but if you use the -

582
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,890
snapshot option you create a

583
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,830
downloadable file that you can then

584
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:41,770
analyze offline and if you want find out

585
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:44,470
about it look here Black Hills has a

586
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,820
great article that talks about the kinds

587
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,010
of information but you're looking for

588
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,800
things like the MS fu 30 password field

589
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,570
which is Microsoft's services for UNIX

590
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,120
the UNIX user password might have it in

591
00:23:52,570 --> 00:24:00,189
their description comment other fields

592
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,719
and hunting for group policy preference

593
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,370
files is another place to find

594
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,620
credentials that you can use to move

595
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:09,850
throughout the network and they're

596
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:11,500
usually elevated privileges now GPP this

597
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:15,459
the issue that caused this has been

598
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:19,120
fixed but as we know takes a long time

599
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,400
for technology to change over and once

600
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,080
the domain has been built in these group

601
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,980
policy preference files are out in sis

602
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,510
wall

603
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,990
they're probably still going to be there

604
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:30,908
for a long time and these files

605
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:34,000
helpfully contain credentials

606
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:36,279
lots of times they're used to provision

607
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,289
a workstation local admin account on a

608
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:39,639
machine and that they'll push that out

609
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,950
through group policy or maybe they'll

610
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:43,979
use it to map a drive and the creds are

611
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:46,510
in those files and they can be decrypted

612
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,669
again another ATS security article on

613
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,889
how to do that you can also look for

614
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:53,830
these programmatically with Powersports

615
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:57,428
get GPP password and you can use

616
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:59,799
power-ups get cashed GPP password if

617
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:05,409
you're looking for a cheap EP file that

618
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:08,250
has been cashed on a workstation I'm a

619
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:08,250
little bit ahead schedule

620
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:19,050
[Applause]

621
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:20,280
they're our last one all right lateral

622
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,369
movement how do we get moving

623
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,369
[Music]

624
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,760
well we can look for your lateral

625
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,600
movement opportunities with something

626
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,879
like power views test admin access or we

627
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,169
can test for everything with test admin

628
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,510
access and this tells us if we have

629
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,920
local admin access to a workstation all

630
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,560
the workstations and computers in the

631
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,510
domain this might be noisy

632
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,120
so there are other methods that you can

633
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:51,760
do this individually and to make it

634
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,949
slower but it's an option for finding it

635
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,879
this is not definitely not the only

636
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:59,740
means of doing it my favorite method

637
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:06,040
which is decidedly low-tech

638
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:07,530
but it works is trawling file shares for

639
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,530
files that have sensitive information

640
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:14,379
like if it works it's not stupid I feel

641
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,760
so it's like man I wish I could have

642
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,120
done something cool on this assessment

643
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,620
but I won because it was in a file and

644
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,169
that happens so many times I find

645
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:27,129
elevated credentials in files whether

646
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:28,630
it's da/sa for a sequel server some

647
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,620
other kind of account I find them in

648
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:34,450
files all over on file shares on systems

649
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:38,110
one that is especially cool that I found

650
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:40,210
out just recently from Chris hunter is

651
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,300
PowerShell PS Red Line logs how many

652
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:46,240
know who what those are got a couple of

653
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:50,440
hands they're essentially the bash in

654
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,550
history file for PowerShell and one of

655
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,750
the things if you ever use PowerShell

656
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,790
you know that you need to pass

657
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:57,310
credential objects to other things to

658
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,990
interact with them sometimes you can do

659
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,700
that in one of two ways you can have

660
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:04,420
power shell prompt you for your password

661
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:06,430
or you can put the password in a

662
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:08,950
variable if you put the password in the

663
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:11,740
variable and PS read Line logs are

664
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:15,250
enabled your password is now stored in

665
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,900
that that history file so it's I don't

666
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,750
know the exact path but it is the

667
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:24,010
console host underscore history txt I

668
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,660
think it's an app data roaming low or

669
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:28,690
low Roman whichever the order is

670
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:31,830
Microsoft Windows PowerShell and if you

671
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:35,140
find that file you will likely find gold

672
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:37,810
we also look for things like source code

673
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:40,480
and I don't know why this happens but

674
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:43,330
you Webroot for web service gets shared

675
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,860
out frequently and if they talk to any

676
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,960
other systems like a database server

677
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,610
you've got a web config in there that

678
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,530
probably has connection strings and

679
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,300
those connection strings those

680
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:54,310
credentials probably used by several

681
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,250
other service accounts because those get

682
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:59,710
shared all the time but it's not just

683
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,660
about getting credentials because I've

684
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:05,110
talked about you know it's not about da

685
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,670
is not the destination we find sensitive

686
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:10,570
data we're just looking for data on

687
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:11,770
things like this and looking for credit

688
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,889
card numbers that aren't encrypted

689
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:17,770
looking for pH I in files looking for

690
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:20,800
intellectual property that's should be

691
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:24,700
restricted another thing looking for the

692
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,740
IT folder honest-to-god the IT folder is

693
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,990
where I find most of the things it's not

694
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,730
properly restricted and there's some

695
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,840
spreadsheet there's some script there's

696
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,530
something like that that has the

697
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,389
passwords that I need to get somewhere

698
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:40,210
but I find all kinds of data and you can

699
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:42,100
do that manually and once you've done it

700
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,690
enough times and you start mapping out

701
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,790
the shares and are on this on the

702
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,820
network you get a pretty good feel for

703
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:51,879
what's in that folder just by the name

704
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,350
you can do it programmatically looking

705
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,900
for all the shares with Power View

706
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,490
invoke share finder and if you add the

707
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,370
check access flag it will tell you if

708
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,930
you have access to that share and you

709
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,270
can use find interesting domain file

710
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:06,910
share our share file to search for files

711
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:09,910
with a wild-card like any file that has

712
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:12,070
the word password in it for instance or

713
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:17,860
find interesting file to search on a

714
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:21,010
local system and also look for session

715
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:23,860
type files so things like SSH private

716
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:28,240
keys RDP files that have credentials

717
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:30,550
bound to them FileZilla winscp there's

718
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,340
all kinds of file there's all kinds of

719
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:35,320
services out there that have these

720
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,939
configuration files that have passwords

721
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,230
in them sometimes they're encrypted and

722
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,420
you got to go through some magic to get

723
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,280
to them but these session files can

724
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,230
allow you to move around the network as

725
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,450
another user you can look from

726
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:48,130
automatically using session gopher it's

727
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,170
another great tool thanks to Chris

728
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:53,570
truster for teaching me about that one

729
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,370
now this next technique is something

730
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,379
that works great especially if you're

731
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,629
doing the malicious user model where

732
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,520
you've got to bring your own tool set I

733
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,080
have bring your own PowerShell but

734
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,120
there's no reason that this couldn't be

735
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,600
bring your own bullying or bring your

736
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,399
own ironpython one of the things like

737
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,020
they do with PowerShell I know it was

738
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,000
telling us yesterday PowerShell is dead

739
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,850
in a lot of places it is dead but

740
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,750
there's a lot of places it's not and I

741
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:24,020
love the ISE if I have graphical access

742
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:26,600
because the ISE will allow you to

743
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,460
execute power shell even if PowerShell

744
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,679
is disabled on the system if PowerShell

745
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,320
scripts are disabled because when you

746
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:36,620
paste PowerShell into the ISE it is not

747
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,689
a script it's just something else that

748
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,209
PowerShell that executes like PowerShell

749
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,010
but it magically becomes a script right

750
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,210
when you save it once you save it you

751
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,370
try to run it you'll get the message

752
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:49,580
script execution is disabled so just

753
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,909
don't hit save and you can execute power

754
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,500
shell

755
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,940
so there's a way to get PowerShell

756
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,310
execution even if you don't have it

757
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:59,540
another brilliant way to do it again

758
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:01,669
right from a full metal cache power line

759
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:05,330
anyone played with power line a couple

760
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,950
people anyone Wow power line is great

761
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,659
you really need to check it out power

762
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,490
line is a self-contained

763
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,800
portable PowerShell execution

764
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:15,140
environment in an executable that you

765
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,060
can drop anywhere you still have to deal

766
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,970
with a V and E D are seeing it sometimes

767
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,590
you got to work around that but

768
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,620
you take power line it's got a

769
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:27,649
configuration file and you say I want my

770
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:30,559
power line to include me me cats and

771
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:32,899
invoke Auto Kerberos and power up and

772
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,928
power up sequel and Power View and

773
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:38,360
whatever else you want you run the build

774
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,799
script it goes and downloads all of

775
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,809
those various PowerShell scripts that

776
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:43,908
you want included they get compiled into

777
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:45,769
the final executable and then that

778
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:49,929
executable contains all of those so when

779
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:52,549
you run you just run like power line -

780
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:55,629
something you know invoke mimikatz and

781
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:58,519
that's all compiled into this binary and

782
00:31:55,629 --> 00:32:00,469
you now have your PowerShell environment

783
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:05,240
in an environment where PowerShell is

784
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:09,679
disabled so there are a lot of pros and

785
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:13,490
cons on both sides of this for assume

786
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,500
breach testing on the pro side we talked

787
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,600
about the whole point here is to help

788
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,570
our clients understand how they will

789
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,209
perform against real-world adversaries

790
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:24,379
so doing this type of test gives them a

791
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,169
better understanding of their strengths

792
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:29,689
and weaknesses as it pertains to those

793
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:31,700
kinds adversaries and we can make our

794
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,500
test as sophisticated or simple as we

795
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,360
want by just going out and reading the

796
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:39,169
TTP's that are used by various threat

797
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:43,479
actors and emulating those on the

798
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:45,620
downside attackers have a lot of time

799
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,389
just like when I talked about domain

800
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,299
fronting attackers have the privilege of

801
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:52,370
are they you know the ability to go out

802
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:53,990
and just compromise someone's website

803
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,969
and be like I'm gonna use this to

804
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,200
distribute my malware we can't do that

805
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,720
so that's why we have to use domain

806
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,509
fronting to try to hide our traffic well

807
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,850
they also have unlimited time and we

808
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:07,309
have a limited amount of time and so if

809
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:10,189
we want to demonstrate the same impact

810
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:12,200
we need to move at a faster pace than a

811
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,269
real attacker would be moving which

812
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,120
means we probably need to be noisier

813
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:20,149
there are trade-offs so it's hard to do

814
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,899
a one-way kasym recent test that shows

815
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:26,539
real impact and also tries to hide from

816
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:29,090
a really good blue team because we need

817
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:33,259
to be slower and being faster means

818
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,110
we're noisier so there is one potential

819
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:36,510
con there

820
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:39,990
it's also not focused on vulnerabilities

821
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:41,400
so this is a con because on an internal

822
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,800
pen test we find all kinds of

823
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,450
vulnerabilities that need to be patched

824
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,610
configuration issues things like that

825
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,770
enter an assumed breach test we may

826
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,850
report on those because we may end up

827
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,910
finding that there's a vulnerability

828
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:55,679
that we can use to get access something

829
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:57,600
like that and so if that's what we have

830
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,960
to do we'll use it but it's not our

831
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,300
focus so there may be glaring holes that

832
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,980
aren't patched on a network and we don't

833
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,379
know about it we haven't reported on it

834
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,719
and if we don't report on it and the

835
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,520
client hasn't passed it they might not

836
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:13,799
know about it so it's still going to be

837
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,009
there when we leave and issue our report

838
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,720
and we can be really hampered by not

839
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,510
having those representative accounts and

840
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:24,509
workstations if I don't have an account

841
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:26,310
that has the same privileges as the user

842
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,620
I'm trying to emulate I can't access the

843
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:30,630
same resources they have same thing with

844
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,949
the workstations we've talked about you

845
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,810
know like software that's on a

846
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:35,428
workstation because there may be a local

847
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:37,350
privilege escalation or an information

848
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,929
disclosure in the software that's on a

849
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:42,270
standard image that we don't have that

850
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:43,679
you had we have that we would have ended

851
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:45,750
up in a completely different place on

852
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,450
the pen test so it's it's critical that

853
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:51,060
we have those representative accounts

854
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:53,850
and workstations so to try to wrap

855
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,500
things up I think that assume breach pen

856
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,790
testing is a better way to prepare

857
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,160
clients for the attacks that are likely

858
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:02,100
to face they can actually see what

859
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,899
attackers might be doing the techniques

860
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,259
that they would use and their own

861
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,910
ability to see those techniques what do

862
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,490
they have do they have visibility on it

863
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:14,460
or do they not but it does require

864
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,799
maturity in the target organization so

865
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,240
if it's a new company that doesn't have

866
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,730
or is a company that just doesn't have

867
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,189
very mature IT processes this might not

868
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:24,780
be for them there are still people that

869
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,520
have never had a pen test I did one this

870
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,740
year they'd never had a pen test we

871
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,270
could have done assumed breach test but

872
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,950
then we wouldn't have found that you

873
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:34,290
know there are all kinds of things

874
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:38,759
unpatched null sessions are enabled SMB

875
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:40,080
v1 LM and r NB NS all kinds for

876
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,750
character passwords and things like that

877
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,480
like we might not have found all of

878
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,010
those things and I think that they might

879
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,800
have been better served by doing the

880
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,210
internal Penta

881
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,190
then we would have done unassuming

882
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,180
reached because yes we assume that

883
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,380
you're going to be breached and we

884
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,330
assume the attackers going to get

885
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,030
everything because you just don't have

886
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,620
that built up that maturity so you may

887
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,120
need to work with your clients on doing

888
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,730
vulnerability assessment and pen test

889
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,819
for a while to get them into shape where

890
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,170
they're ready for an assumed breach test

891
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,840
again work with the client to get

892
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:14,020
accounts of workstations and I know that

893
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,120
I have said PowerShell and cobalt strike

894
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:18,730
a lot just using it as a matter of

895
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,900
reference is not absolutely the thing

896
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:23,020
that you should be using

897
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,270
it's just something familiar there are

898
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:27,700
so many different goods see two options

899
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:30,540
that are coming out that if we put some

900
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:33,009
work into them can be really great

901
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,900
learned about throwback and slingshot

902
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,900
earlier this week in a class that still

903
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:42,760
looks good we have things like faction

904
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:43,930
c2 and sliver and think Merlin and

905
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,400
there's there's a whole bunch of they're

906
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,410
coming out there's so many different

907
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,770
options available for you for c2 s and

908
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:52,600
the same thing for executing code

909
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:57,160
marchello from Black Hills white bleeder

910
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,660
follow him learn because blowing my mind

911
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,730
was some of the things he's doing like I

912
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:03,279
am with ironpython and boo laying and

913
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:07,300
running alternative languages in dotnet

914
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,010
on systems where PowerShell the reason

915
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,260
we're getting killed on it mics have

916
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:13,360
spent a lot of time investing visibility

917
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,800
into that you throw a different language

918
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:19,630
like ironpython in there and they're

919
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:22,000
like it's some must be good and they

920
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:24,400
allow it to run so unless you have a

921
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,950
really good ETR that's doing you know

922
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,140
heuristic type things like that behavior

923
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:31,410
is odd you know it

924
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,850
[Music]

925
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:36,069
you're going to get a lot farther with

926
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,630
those kinds of languages and you can if

927
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,100
you have the ability to develop you

928
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,620
could really pour any language you

929
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,270
wanted into net not tell anyone about it

930
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,549
and you'd have a lot of ability to

931
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,509
continue running for a long time without

932
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,810
being seen

933
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:52,960
so there's a research project for you so

934
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:54,460
with that I am Mike at read siege comm

935
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,610
if you have questions comments whatever

936
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:00,880
hard water hacker on Twitter and I know

937
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:05,020
this is tiny but read siege comm slash

938
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,670
ABM read siege comm slash ABM is where

939
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,610
you can download these slides and I'll

940
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,990
tweet it out afterwards too so you can

941
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,640
download a copy the slides from there

942
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:15,549
and if you have any questions on it I

943
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,560
would love to hear it I do want to thank

944
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,050
Derby con and the staff for having me

945
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,490
here it's I think my sixth Derby con and

946
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,380
my first time speaking and it's been a

947
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:25,990
privilege every time and thank all of

948
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,060
you for being here because it's just

949
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:29,319
incredible

950
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:32,020
being at Derby con of being able to do

951
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:34,180
this and I appreciate all of you so with

952
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:38,170
that that's all I have are there

953
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:40,180
questions I will also add that when

954
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,650
we're done they're a bunch of stickers

955
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,000
on the front table that you should take

956
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:48,030
with you so I don't have to take them

957
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,030
home any questions comments concerns

958
00:38:48,360 --> 00:39:00,460
once yes do I have any shirts no tweet

959
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:02,290
at Tim Madine for complaints the trade

960
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,390
for a spotted cow if I had shirts I

961
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:07,050
could take this one off all right thanks

962
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,049
everyone that's all I have
