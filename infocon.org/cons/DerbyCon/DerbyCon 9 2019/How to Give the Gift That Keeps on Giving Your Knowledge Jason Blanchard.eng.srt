22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,890
gift that keeps on giving and that's

23
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,200
your knowledge and really it's inspired

24
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,360
by what derbycon is derbycon is about a

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,860
place to share your knowledge and I have

26
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,479
been amazed because I work in marketing

27
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,819
I'll talk about in a second I've been

28
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,289
amazed that you so freely give your

29
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:30,670
knowledge you know there's so many

30
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,259
people that come to derbycon that just

31
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,490
want to share they've learned something

32
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,470
and they want to pass it on to someone

33
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,330
else and it's amazing to see that in the

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,119
InfoSec community I come from marketing

35
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,170
it's not like that in marketing the

36
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,030
whole reason they're there to share

37
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,280
their knowledge is to get something back

38
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,690
in return because they want to benefit

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,700
from the fact that they're sharing their

40
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,039
knowledge but I've watched so many talk

41
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,209
after talk after talk in person to say

42
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,200
you know I learned this really cool

43
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:54,940
thing and I just want to share with

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,640
somebody else and it's just really cool

45
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,929
to see that in this community and so if

46
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,729
there was a way I could replicate this

47
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:02,200
in marketing I would but the marketing

48
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,599
people would take over and like one day

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,629
and it would just ruin it because that's

50
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,039
what we do we ruin it but this is the

51
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:11,920
gift that keeps on giving your knowledge

52
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,149
and I am Jason Blanchard I work for a

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,280
small company called Black Hills

54
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,569
information security the reason why I

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,739
can tell you a lot of the things that

56
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,049
I'm going to tell you today is because

57
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:23,830
we do all the things that we do that I'm

58
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:26,230
going to talk about my hash hashtag my

59
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,700
twitter needles banjo crash-land if you

60
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,140
wonder where that name came from it's

61
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,480
just Jason Blanchard with all the

62
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,420
letters mixed up turned into banter

63
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,579
crash-land and that is my email address

64
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:40,250
if you have any questions and yes hash

65
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,500
tag I work in marketing sorry

66
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:48,500
I am a storyteller I was born the

67
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:50,720
storyteller hi I like to start that

68
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,300
because I just like to tell stories like

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,320
from the very young age I would tell

70
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,030
stories and other people would be

71
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,380
interested in those stories and then

72
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,180
people would laugh and then I felt

73
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,000
validation from that so I kept doing it

74
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,740
so I've always been a storyteller and if

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,350
I could have another career it would

76
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,790
just be to write and tell stories but

77
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,200
that's the reason I went into marketing

78
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,269
because marketing is all about telling a

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,350
story and telling it in a way that

80
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,690
people want to hear it

81
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,299
I keep saying I work in marketing I'm

82
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,680
sorry I'm a comedian that's what I do

83
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,690
for a hobby everyone should have a hobby

84
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,890
a - to get people to laugh by telling

85
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:29,840
all kinds of terrible things about

86
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:31,130
myself and then people filmmaking so if

87
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,660
you're wondering like why is he always

88
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,709
doing like the things he does in

89
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,790
marketing it's like because my

90
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,490
backgrounds the comic books and

91
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,890
filmmaking so thankfully a nice man

92
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,350
named ed SCOTUS saw that I would be

93
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,029
useful in the InfoSec community by

94
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,829
having a background in comic books and

95
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,269
filmmaking and he said this seems like

96
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,100
the right kind of guy to bring on and

97
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:51,140
that's why I worked at I worked as sans

98
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,820
for a long time doing marketing for them

99
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,649
and it was my background in complex

100
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,780
filmmaking that really translated well

101
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,390
into the hacker community and so I'm

102
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,580
happy to be here I did teach film and I

103
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,109
was a teacher so I taught the film and I

104
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,230
was in - yeah so I taught for nine years

105
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,390
so I talked filmmaking content creation

106
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,738
marketing things like that so some of

107
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,660
the concepts that come from today is

108
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:13,310
what I talked filmmakers over the course

109
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,200
of about nine years and a lot of them

110
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,430
which is really cool to watch you know

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,829
through social media I've been able to

112
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,168
watch their careers grow and how they've

113
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,940
become directors or producers or you

114
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:24,500
know scimitar AFER's or something I've

115
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,300
been able to watch the things that I

116
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,960
taught them nine years ago how they

117
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:33,169
applied them and use them to this day

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,640
all right I use this all the time and so

119
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,990
I want you to raise your hand if you're

120
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,199
shy

121
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,690
cool and say alright awesome and the

122
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,250
fact that you came to a place on how to

123
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,680
share your knowledge even though you're

124
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,009
shy says a lot about you cuz you're like

125
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,380
I know I'm shy but I'm willing to maybe

126
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:53,210
learn something that will help me help

127
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,520
others and I think that's really neat

128
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,500
but the problem with being shy is that

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,090
if you're shy the things I'm gonna talk

130
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,849
about are gonna scare the crap out of

131
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,299
you because all of a sudden you're gonna

132
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:06,710
start thinking in your head you're like

133
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,199
this is right for me and that's fine

134
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,690
that's fine and and I'm pretty sure that

135
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,849
it meets like 4 percent of the room in

136
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,990
here and I said 4 percent because I work

137
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:18,680
in marketing so I just make up

138
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,120
percentages all the time 4 percent of

139
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,560
the audience will take what I talked

140
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,030
about today and you're gonna apply it in

141
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,130
years from now you're gonna have a very

142
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,479
successful podcast webcast whatever kind

143
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,919
of career because you're gonna apply

144
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,090
what I talked about today and maybe

145
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,130
you're already doing this and you just

146
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,919
need to learn some new tactics but the

147
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:37,270
rest of you that 96 percent or ninety

148
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,830
twenty two percent so that's a meet-up

149
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,130
you're gonna hear this today and you're

150
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,169
like I hear it but I'm not gonna do it

151
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,789
and that's totally fine but maybe I'll

152
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:48,560
unveil some of the things that you

153
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:50,449
didn't know about how the people who you

154
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,130
listen to the podcast the webcast and

155
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,050
the people who get up on stage and talk

156
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,490
all the time maybe I'll unveil some of

157
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,960
the things that they do and you'll go

158
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,570
actually that doesn't seem that

159
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,000
difficult the other thing I want you to

160
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,580
know is that I know most of the people

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,990
who present at conferences the nice

162
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,840
thing about working at where I used to

163
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,289
work is that they were gifted presenters

164
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,049
and gifted webcast people gifted podcast

165
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:17,150
people and after every single time I saw

166
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:21,349
them talk they would come up to me and

167
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:24,590
so how was that it was good that's good

168
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:26,930
yeah it's good it's good okay because

169
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,190
they weren't sure like they came up with

170
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,810
the talk they wanted to give it up on

171
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,919
stage they presented it to all of you

172
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,990
and at the end of it they weren't sure

173
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,580
if it was good and so if you were like

174
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,530
wondering I'm not sure if this is gonna

175
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,419
be good sure that's what all of this

176
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,340
thing I have no idea of this talk right

177
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,280
now is gonna be good at all and I'm

178
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,380
still giving it here we are and I'm also

179
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,750
shy I didn't raise my hand but I am shy

180
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,150
if you catch me and not

181
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,710
here I'm a generalist shy person if you

182
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,679
come to my booth I'm gonna talk to you

183
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:59,299
because that's my job but if I'm not I'm

184
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,500
just like I'm playing if I see you

185
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,040
wearing a shirt I gave that I'll come

186
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,720
talk to you because we have a bond we

187
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,830
have a bond I gave you a thing and now I

188
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,420
have permission to come talk to you

189
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:14,510
anytime I want to thank you and then the

190
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,250
next part is even worse so let's say you

191
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,570
get over the shy part and you're like

192
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,340
I'm gonna do this I'm gonna write

193
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,960
something I'm gonna do a webcast I'm

194
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,210
gonna give her presentation the next

195
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,140
part is even worse it's the sound of

196
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:29,299
your own voice you have no idea how bad

197
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:34,039
it is until you hear it

198
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:37,750
like and it's not like the thing is your

199
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,180
voice is fine but not to you

200
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,710
and my voice is fine I talked with this

201
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,870
voice all the time but when I listened

202
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,669
to this recording meta let's go get real

203
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,800
meta right now Jason when you listen to

204
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,360
this in a few weeks you're gonna believe

205
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,810
how I sound

206
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,160
yep that's how I sound one of the first

207
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,930
exercises I went through a podcast

208
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,440
training class and the first exercise

209
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,620
was to record two minutes of you talking

210
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,770
and just listen to it over and over and

211
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:09,490
over and over and over again and as you

212
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:11,799
listen to it the first thing I do I

213
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:24,160
really make that noise there's a weird

214
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:27,040
noise that I made in here you don't hear

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,480
it a normal conversation but you do when

216
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,910
you listen to your own voice over and

217
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,520
over again for two minutes what is that

218
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,500
thing I do and so this is one of the

219
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,640
hardest parts to get over your own voice

220
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,890
but here's what I want you to know every

221
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,419
single person has a podcast webcast they

222
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,250
heated the sound of their own voice too

223
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,990
and they still do it anyway

224
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,610
and we'll talk a little bit about how

225
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,990
you can overcome this towards the end of

226
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,680
this but your own voice just get over it

227
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,080
it's fine

228
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,819
you've been using it your entire life

229
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,160
it's okay the other thing is the

230
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,960
imposter syndrome why should you have a

231
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,969
podcast we have absolutely nothing to

232
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,679
talk about

233
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,379
because there's other people that have

234
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,549
them they've already covered it there's

235
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:12,479
no reason for mine

236
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:14,709
no one's gonna listen to mine possible

237
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:17,349
but there's a thing that you have that

238
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:19,299
no one else does and it's you and it's

239
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,529
your own experiences your own mind it's

240
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:22,539
your own creativity it's your own this

241
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:23,559
it's your own bat and yes there is

242
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,848
someone out there that has a better

243
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,559
podcast of you and they may have been

244
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:28,629
doing it for five years and that's why

245
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,509
it's better because your first podcast

246
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:35,259
or webcast or live presentation is gonna

247
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:38,289
suck it will suck I'm telling you right

248
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:40,059
now it's going to suck but I'm not

249
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:42,098
telling you it's gonna suck I'm telling

250
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,959
you that you think it's gonna suck neck

251
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:47,139
got weird so here's what I mean by that

252
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:49,539
if you gave your first presentation it

253
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:51,639
was recorded five years from now if you

254
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:54,279
go back and watch it and you and you

255
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:57,399
watch it you'll think to yourself and it

256
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,799
sucks and the reason why you think it

257
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,629
sucks is because with five years of

258
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,108
experience you'll see all the mistakes

259
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:08,679
that you made in that very first one and

260
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:11,829
that's fine so what I'm saying is go

261
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:14,249
make something that sucks because over

262
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:19,179
time it will get better

263
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:24,449
so imposter syndrome I would say eff it

264
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:24,449
we're recording this method

265
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,560
there's a saying I always told my

266
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,510
students and I'm gonna say it to you

267
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,849
right now but I'm gonna share change it

268
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,520
up a little bit and I used to say this

269
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,720
for networking purposes and it was you

270
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,230
know for networking

271
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,550
she's the shy few viewed enriched and

272
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,340
because you're too shy to actually raise

273
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,660
your that's fine but the shy thing is

274
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,160
that it makes it difficult for you to

275
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,600
network with other people because you

276
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,910
may have an assumption in your brain

277
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,200
that they don't want to talk to you

278
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,300
right if I go up and talk to a stranger

279
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,010
they're gonna wonder how long this

280
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,160
conversations gonna take and then when

281
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,140
can they leave but that's not true

282
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,520
so when you go and introduce yourself to

283
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,689
somebody especially here at derbycon

284
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,100
hopefully you did it over the last

285
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,810
weekend and you do it at whatever

286
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,240
conference you go to you have permission

287
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,380
to talk to every single person there if

288
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,760
you didn't know that I'm giving it to

289
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,740
you right now you have permission to

290
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,930
talk to every single person you meet at

291
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,080
a conference because that's why they

292
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,969
came to the colonies they're too shy to

293
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,890
come talk to you so you have to be the

294
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,810
person that goes and talks to them the

295
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,550
DES Sue's you say hey how's it going um

296
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,550
what's your name where you're from good

297
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:35,449
G are you social engineering me right

298
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,670
now what are we doing what's happening

299
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,500
why are you talking to me I had a person

300
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:45,680
come up to me once MZ don't I know you

301
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:47,210
and how's he know because I know where

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,760
this goes like all the sudden is the

303
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:53,870
last for my credit card where I grew up

304
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,840
and offs so you're a little I understand

305
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,510
this audience is little what's the word

306
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:04,250
trust issues trust issues yeah so if

307
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:05,180
anyone comes up and talks to you but if

308
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,410
you go up and talk to someone they're

309
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,880
gonna have the same trust issues so it's

310
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,740
gonna take a little bit for you to

311
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,500
overcome that which is why I encourage

312
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,000
you to give presentations if there's any

313
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,410
reason that you leave here today

314
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,690
thinking I should give a presentation

315
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,370
it's that because when you're on stage

316
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,990
and you're talking and you're sharing

317
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,640
your knowledge I have given permission

318
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,840
to every single person in this room and

319
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,730
every person who ever watches this

320
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,190
recording to come up and talk to me and

321
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,610
say I saw that talk that you gave at

322
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,380
derbycon

323
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,580
you at the end of this can come up and

324
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,500
talk to me and ask any question you want

325
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,020
to I have now given you permission to

326
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,420
come talk to me this is the easiest way

327
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,370
to network with people is to get up on

328
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:45,050
stage share your knowledge and

329
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:47,810
afterwards even if 97.2% of people

330
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,920
disliked it a few people did and they'll

331
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,609
come up and talk to you and you just

332
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,050
networked so I'm gonna change this a

333
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,610
little bit so I used to say never deny

334
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,550
someone the opportunity to meet you

335
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,190
never deny the opportunity for someone

336
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,569
to meet you but for today's talking once

337
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,520
they never denied the opportunity to

338
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,490
share the knowledge that you have with

339
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,350
someone that doesn't have it yet never

340
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,520
denies someone the opportunity to share

341
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,800
the knowledge that you have

342
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,470
with some of the dozen haven't changed

343
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,339
because every person in this room has

344
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,890
experiences and knowledge that someone

345
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,600
else doesn't have and maybe someone is

346
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,680
smarter than you and already knows what

347
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,810
you know but there are people out there

348
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,520
that don't know what you know the reason

349
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,040
I like working for John strand is he has

350
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:31,519
a saying that says stop being a wizard

351
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,079
trying to impress other wizards

352
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,679
he's someone that has knowledge this

353
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:38,359
years it was someone that doesn't so if

354
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:40,240
you're worried about the wizard out

355
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,649
there that's gonna say I already do that

356
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,679
don't worry about that worry about the

357
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:48,350
people that don't know again so why even

358
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,869
do this why you didn't do a podcast

359
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,470
webcast presentation blog why you to do

360
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:53,600
any of this

361
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,189
and you have to ask yourself that like

362
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,110
why are you gonna do it and there are

363
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:59,209
three main reasons why you do it the

364
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,470
first ones to give back then if someone

365
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,969
has shared knowledge to you at some

366
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,529
point now it's your chance to share

367
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,300
knowledge for someone else and that's

368
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:10,610
fantastic if that is your pure

369
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,809
motivation you shouldn't it's going to

370
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,939
come through and everything that you

371
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,410
create you're going to be a generous

372
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:17,420
human being that just says I have a

373
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,589
thing and I want to give it to you and

374
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,929
your knowledge is the cheapest thing

375
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:23,029
that you can give to someone else it's

376
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:26,860
the least expensive I didn't mean to say

377
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:29,949
cheap that's not cheap least expensive

378
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,819
make money you can make money from this

379
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:33,079
absolutely you can make money from this

380
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:34,719
and the reason why I know that is

381
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,510
because I'm a marketer

382
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,300
I get money to people who figured this

383
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,860
out because they build an audience of

384
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,599
people I want to reach and I'm like I

385
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,460
want to reach that audience you already

386
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,070
reached that audience let me give you

387
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,990
money to reach your audience and so you

388
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,720
can make money by doing this because

389
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,100
once you build up an audience of engaged

390
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,020
people who want to hear what you have

391
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,350
while you're sharing knowledge people

392
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:02,470
like me start showing up and like I hear

393
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,400
you have like 100 followers could I give

394
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:10,080
you ten dollars for that

395
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:13,949
am i selling my soul right now yeah it

396
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,360
could be yeah or as if this was the

397
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,890
whole reason you went into in the first

398
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,760

400
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,420
other one is to build a career the thing

401
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,460
about building her career is if you're

402
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,189

403
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,839

404
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:33,029
wanted to switch jobs and you wanted to

405
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,560
mention that or put that in whatever it

406
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:37,260
is that you create do you think you

407
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,029

408
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,589

410
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,770
topic and you want to start consulting

411
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,410
on that topic

412
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,970
people are gonna hire you for that

413
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,069
specific thing let's say you lose your

414
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,080
job in a layoff but you have 10,000

415
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,510
people that listen to your podcast how

416
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,520
long do you think you'll be out of work

417
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,910
not long at all because you just go on

418
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,100

419
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:03,660
economic circumstances I have been let

420
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,430
go for my employer

421
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,680
anyone out there want to hire someone

422
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,329
that has these skills and just list them

423
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,829
you just created a commercial for

424
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,209
yourself and all the sudden the emails

425
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,100
are coming in about you working for

426
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:17,750
somebody else and if you're listening to

427
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,980

429
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,279
reasons but I need you to know why

430
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,890
you're doing any of this in the first

431
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,770
place before you start making because if

432
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,420
it is to give back that's going to be

433
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,850
the perspective that you come from with

434
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,410
all this if it is to make money it's

435
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,610
gonna change the way that you do any of

436
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,890
the things I'm going to talk about and

437
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,890
if it's to build your career awesome but

438
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:43,439
here's the cool thing by giving back you

439
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,110
can make money and build your career you

440
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,240
can do all three by just sharing your

441
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,310
knowledge with people people will show

442
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,930
if I want to pay you and and let's say

443
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:54,150
they want to give you money but they

444
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,430
want to change your show you don't have

445
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,050
to take their money you can say I'm

446
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,310
gonna do the shoe that I want to do I'm

447
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,199
gonna write the thing I want to write

448
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,209

449
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:07,339
want to give me money fine you don't

450
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:07,339

451
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,240
all right so here's the types of stuff

452
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm going to talk about we're gonna go

453
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,470
more in depth with these I just wanted

454
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,060
to give you context like why did do it

455
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,500

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,448
just be webcast until I saw someone

460
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,579

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,429
could do

485
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:37,460
easiest thing it's getting a screen

489
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:46,250
next three minutes and that's it because

490
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,530
someone is doing a search for it how do

491
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,390
I do an exploit Metasploit because

492
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,190
they've never done it before they just

493
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,390
heard about Metasploit and they don't

494
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,860
know what they're doing and if you're

495
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,890
like oh there's all these tutorials out

496
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,479
there that's right there are but there's

497
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,520
not one that's three minutes long that's

498
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,940
in your voice with your history and your

499
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,100
story that's gonna go along with it

500
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,900
blogs it's a real simple thing it's

501
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,658
almost a requirement where I work now is

502
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,130
write a blog and it's a way of sharing

503
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:14,780
your knowledge if there's a thing that

504
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,120
you just did it work that you thought

505
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,309
was really cool screen captured right

506
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,840
out topics on it and if you're wondering

507
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:23,120
like well how do I get started on this I

508
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,629
gave a web I gave a talk at Derby con

509
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,000
two years ago and how to do Hal twos or

510
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,380
how to give presentation and it just

511
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,150
kind of goes through all the different

512
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,039
steps that you would need like a hook a

513
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,330
beginning a middle a climax and an end

514
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,070
and all the different things in that so

515
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,100
if you want to go and watch that on

516
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:43,470
YouTube you can it's uh what is the time

517
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,820
I call them

518
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,489
presentations or presentations for sake

519
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,779
of presentation and the reason why I

520
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:51,850
called it that is because if anyone to

521
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:54,639
dessert for derbycon presentations guess

522
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,619
who showed up or highest in the hugo

523
00:19:54,639 --> 00:20:01,658
search results just put the word

524
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:03,399
presentation in okay live presentations

525
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,929
what I'm currently doing right now and

526
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:05,590
if the thought of getting up in front of

527
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,250
an audience

528
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:10,620
scares you do it anyway

529
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:14,159
you have no idea what the adrenaline

530
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,600
rush is like up here I just stumbled

531
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,780
over all my words because I was talking

532
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,330
about adrenaline but yeah this is

533
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,129
exciting after this I'm gonna go and sit

534
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,949
down if I still smoked I'd smoke a

535
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,080
cigarette be great but giving live

536
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,870
presentations is exciting it's fun it's

537
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,330
great I highly recommend and the last

538
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:37,489
thing is podcast because that way no one

539
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:40,199
sees what you look like it's great

540
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:44,010
someone once told me I had a voice for

541
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:49,980
radio or a face for radio that's what it

542
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:53,190
wasn't these four radio jerks content

543
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,320
junkie there's this really cool

544
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,620
technique called content chunking and

545
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,649
marketing and the concept is you take a

546
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,360
great big piece of content and then you

547
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,340
break it up into smaller pieces of

548
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,399
content so that way you don't have to

549
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,199
keep making content so you take a

550
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,490
presentation that you're giving a live

551
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,679
presentation like this one right here

552
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,710
and then six weeks from now I give it as

553
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,960
a webcast so I give it as a webcast and

554
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,280
I used to talk to people like hey can

555
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,780
you give your live presentation of the

556
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,520
webcast like why would I

557
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,110
they've already heard it like who you're

558
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,510
talking about the people in the room

559
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,918
they've already heard it yeah there's

560
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,740
like a hundred thousand other people out

561
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:35,539
there that weren't in the room and so

562
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,539
it's fine to give the same thing twice

563
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,658
it's fine to give the same presentation

564
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:42,419
eight times at different conferences

565
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,919
because it's a different audience and if

566
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,390
they gets recorded eight different times

567
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,130
I'm pretty sure there was one that was

568
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,200
better than all of them so only talk

569
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,690
about that one I gave a presentation

570
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,549
that besides Augusta that was amazing

571
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,429
and then I gave the same one at Derby

572
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:58,470
gun okay if I want to point anyone to it

573
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:59,730
it's the one that B says Augusta and so

574
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,830
it's fine for you to give it multiple

575
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,909
times and then point people to the one

576
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,010
that you thought was best

577
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:06,210
totally fine with that and the other

578
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,700
thing is you can take that live

579
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:11,250
presentation turn into a webcast at the

580
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,200
end of the live presentation you have

581
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,299
people I give you that ask questions

582
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,300
while now incorporate those questions

583
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,970
into the webcast version

584
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,950
or when people ask questions during the

585
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,590
webcast version yeah that's great

586
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:28,190
those now become my five topics for

587
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:30,110
weapon for blogs so you take the live

588
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,120
presentation you give it as a webcast

589
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,590
people start asking questions you take

590
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,659
those questions you turn them into blog

591
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,860
topics and now you've taken one thing

592
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,160
and turned it into a bunch of different

593
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,479
things and then you reach out to other

594
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,340
podcasters who are already doing InfoSec

595
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,380
and you say hey I gave a talk at

596
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,060
derbycon on this topic would it be

597
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,880
possible for me to go on your podcast

598
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,470
and talk about it and so now you're

599
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,240
talking about on someone else's podcast

600
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,310
and it's still the same content and it's

601
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,350
being used over and over and over and

602
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,860
over and over and over again that make

603
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:03,020
sense and if you had a couple good

604
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,300
slides like this one or this one or

605
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,160
another one that I'm going to show you

606
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,530
can take this and screenshot it put it

607
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,060
out on Twitter or LinkedIn and then you

608
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,700
can give like a bullet point of what you

609
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:17,030
were talking about during that time with

610
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,070
a link to the overall presentation so if

611
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:21,020
you like the word content chunking and I

612
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,250
give a little specifics about it will

613
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,330
follow the link to watch the entire

614
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,740
thing here derbycon

615
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,850
and this whole thing is getting real

616
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,170
meta right now because if you're

617
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,639
watching the recording chances are

618
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,380
you're watching the recording because

619
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,960
you clicked on the link for my LinkedIn

620
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,060
profile because I put a post up there

621
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,240
and now you're watching it hey we're

622
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,240
friends

623
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,970
the other thing is evergreen topics so

624
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,949
there are things in information security

625
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,080
that if if you were to talk about it or

626
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,990
blog about it today chances are it gets

627
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,820
fixed tomorrow like there's a real

628
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:57,170
possibility that if you found an exploit

629
00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:01,919
and Windows Defender so when our windows

630
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:04,320
do you we should fix it and then it's no

631
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,640
longer useful and that's a possibility

632
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,689
and that's fine you can do those but

633
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,750
every one so I'll do something that's

634
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:12,180
evergreen a technique a method a thing

635
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,190
that you do that you found that you that

636
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,900
works for you that you can give and the

637
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,820
reason why is because if you talk about

638
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,490
it today it is still useful year from

639
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,590
now sure so when people are coming to us

640
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,570
from Google search results and from you

641
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,730
talking about on Twitter and they come

642
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,639
to it and it's still useful it's still

643
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,350
good for you and so think about what

644
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,450
kind of topic can I come up with that's

645
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:35,879
evergreen that can be useful to an

646
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,470
audience for a very long time or if you

647
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,180
need to to goes back a couple years

648
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,150
later an update but think about

649
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,220
evergreen topics is there something that

650
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:47,400
I can come up with that can be useful to

651
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,800
people for a long period of time and

652
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,770
then this one another content content

653
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,530
library so if you do a podcast or a

654
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:58,590
webcast or a blog or something put it in

655
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:01,230
a spreadsheet like start creating a

656
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:03,750
spreadsheet of all your content a list

657
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,070
of where it goes and the links to it and

658
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,020
this is something that I've done for

659
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:09,720
years is that you know you write a blog

660
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,129
post on today well six months from now

661
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,990
you can still use it so you can go back

662
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,850
to the spreadsheet and grab them and

663
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:18,330
post it and it makes it real simple for

664
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:20,159
you to just automate and not like

665
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,480
automate in a bad way but automate the

666
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,980
way that you're getting knowledge out to

667
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,590
an audience and the reason why is

668
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,440
because if you have 400 Twitter

669
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,780
followers now but a year from now you

670
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,300
have 1400 Twitter followers is there a

671
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,899
chance that the people who a year from

672
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,610
now never saw the thing you posted today

673
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,020
yeah there's a chance that the thing you

674
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,419
post today no one's going to see a year

675
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,220
from now unless you post it again and so

676
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,110
it's a way for you to take the things

677
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,210
that you're creating today and use it

678
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,889
over and over and over and over again to

679
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,270
get it out for an audience and those of

680
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,040
you in here that are consultants or your

681
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,330
own your own businesses this is the way

682
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,220
that you can do some marketing for your

683
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,809
own company so that way you can get

684
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,180
people learning about you and the

685
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:01,940
services that you provide in a non coz

686
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:07,850
vendor way so that they want to hire you

687
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:09,980
for what you do all right one last one

688
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:14,240
before we go deep into some of the other

689
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:17,960
things is interviews these are the

690
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,090
Trojan horse for you what I mean by that

691
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,300
is let's say you have a podcast about

692
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:26,419
Windows directory and it's just a

693
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,770
podcast about Windows drink what you can

694
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,230
do is you can reach out to the people

695
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,690
who actually make Windows directory of

696
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:35,360
thing and you can say hey I have a

697
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,550
podcast we have about 500 listeners they

698
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,889
tune in every single week would you be

699
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:42,139
willing to come on to my show and talk

700
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,700
about the nature of how you architect

701
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,910
the thing that you talk you know you

702
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:49,610
created and inherently they're like are

703
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,990
you social engineering me right now hey

704
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,870
white why do you want me to come on your

705
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,040
show and if you do get a chance for them

706
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:58,459
to come on your show and talk about

707
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,720
Windows directory and also once again I

708
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,400
work in marketing if this doesn't make

709
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,520
any sense to you I'm sorry it's just I

710
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,960
don't know but if you have people come

711
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:11,220
onto your show to talk about the thing

712
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:13,620
who did they just meet you

713
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,630
you're meeting the people that work at

714
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,629
the companies that do the thing that you

715
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:23,430
think is cool and you're meeting them

716
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,860
you're you're interviewing them and so

717
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,690
in my line of work if I wanted to

718
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,969
interview somebody that was incredibly

719
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,280
famous for doing the thing that they did

720
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,910
by talking to them I've just introduced

721
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,770
myself to them it's a form of networking

722
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,050
so I want you to think about the ten

723
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,580
people you want to interview that work

724
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,290
in the industry that you want and it may

725
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,600
not be InfoSec related if you like

726
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,550
action figures and you want to do a

727
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,659
podcast on action figures because that's

728
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,490
your hobby and that's the thing that you

729
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,810
love then start interviewing the people

730
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:56,760
who make action figures

731
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:58,590
if yours show about other youtubers you

732
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,240
can make a show about other youtubers

733
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,040
and then you can interview those

734
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,870
youtubers to come on your show and then

735
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,220
those youtubers talk about the fact that

736
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,729
they were on your show and then you get

737
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:11,190
more audience members you use interviews

738
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,530
to introduce yourself to people you want

739
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,810
to talk to and this is the Trojan horse

740
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:18,030
for introducing yourself and network and

741
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,950
if you're like the gears are starting to

742
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,920
turn right nearly oh I could interview

743
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,570
people who I want to hire me if you

744
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,460
wanted to work at a specific company

745
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,520
interview the people from that company

746
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:34,110
interview the hiring manager

747
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:37,020
duh and as you're talking like hey you

748
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:39,860
got any jobs available me that came out

749
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,860
weird sorry

750
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,049
or you do a great interview and then you

751
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:46,549
follow up two weeks later and you say

752
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:49,039
hey the podcast is available online

753
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:50,330
right now you can tune into it if you

754
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:55,070
want to share the link here's a link

755
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:56,449
also any jobs available and so this is

756
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:59,779
an opportunity for you to meet people

757
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:01,879
and introduce yourself to others and I

758
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,229
have osun's up here because because of

759
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:05,418
the nature of what you do

760
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:09,320
you're really good at finding the people

761
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:11,989
to interview I hired some interns and I

762
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,279
taught them Oh since I was like here is

763
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:19,399
how you track down and you stalk people

764
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,629
and I want you to stalk these 27 people

765
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,129
and I want you to get their email

766
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:23,658
addresses and their phone numbers and

767
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:26,719
their all this stuff and then we're

768
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:28,609
gonna reach out and you have these

769
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,739
particular set of skills that you have

770
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:32,899
that you can do this easier than most

771
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:35,720
people can in other industries you know

772
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:38,719
how to find somebody so think about that

773
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,039
when it comes to this all right so if

774
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,979
you're giving a webcast what is that

775
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:45,379
it's a go to webinar session that you

776
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:48,139
set up that you promote maybe 30 people

777
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:49,998
show up to fantastic but those 30 people

778
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:52,939
that show up to it have now given you

779
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:54,499
their name and email address to show up

780
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,849
for your webinar what I want you to do

781
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:58,720
is start building an email list from

782
00:29:55,849 --> 00:30:01,789
that and so the next webcast that you do

783
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,259
39 people show up and now you have nine

784
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:05,450
new people you add them to your email

785
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:07,309
list but the reason why I want you to do

786
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:10,549
webcast and what this is it's

787
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:12,019
essentially this but online we give

788
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:13,489
webcast that blackulas information

789
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:15,489
security and currently seven hundred and

790
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:18,649
seventy-five people show up on average

791
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:20,210
seven hundred seventy five people that's

792
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:22,609
more people that could fit in this room

793
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,259
right now and so it's like every single

794
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:26,029
time we give a webcast it's like given

795
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:27,139
the keynote address to somebody and

796
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:29,109
what's cool is that at the beginning

797
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:32,389
like before the webcast starts we go

798
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:35,210
where is everyone from and it starts

799
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:37,428

00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,149
difference between a live web cast and a

816
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,639
recorded web cast

817
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:34,439
the thing is a live web cast currently

818
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:37,049
like my live presentation right now is

819
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,320
you're all currently trying your best to

820
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:42,330
pay attention you're the fact that I'm

821
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,120
speaking live right now is the reason

822
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:47,340
that you're not checking your phone the

823
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,590
reason I like I'm speaking live right

824
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,389
now you're not on Twitter maybe you're

825
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,100
on Twitter Anna about two or three

826
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:55,110
people got up and left while I was

827
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:58,740
giving this presentation and internally

828
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:00,870
I like where you're going but the rest

829
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,220
of you are trying your best to stay even

830
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,830
if it wasn't something you were

831
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,470
interested in and that's what happens

832
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,928
during a live webcast people show up and

833
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,029
like I'm here and he's talking where

834
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:16,350
she's talking I might as well stay to

835
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:19,289
the whole damn time what I've learned is

836
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:22,230
retention rates for a live webcast is 90

837
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:24,240
percent the retention rate for a live

838
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,279
webcast 90 percent there are people that

839
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,539
drop off at the 30 minute mark because

840
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:29,909
they had a meeting or something else to

841
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:31,799
go to and that happens but you also pick

842
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:33,360
up people at the 30 minute mark they

843
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,509
couldn't come then they decide to show

844
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,418
up and so the difference between doing a

845
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:42,000
live is people are willing to listen cuz

846
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,220
it's live there's like a like a unspoken

847
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,149
human transaction taking place like well

848
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:51,510
I'll be here too a recorded webcast has

849
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:52,739
a retention rate of 10% because it's

850
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,870
recorded

851
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,610
and if in the first two or three minutes

852
00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:00,570
someone's not like how this isn't for me

853
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:01,979
they leave they totally leave and so I

854
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:06,060
highly recommend you give live

855
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:09,390
webcasting and turned your webcam on

856
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:12,600
turn it on people stay longer if your

857
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:16,160
webcams on because they feel that like

858
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,510
you're a real person all right I'll stay

859
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,340
so turn your webcam on and the other

860
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,260
reason to turn your webcam on is because

861
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:25,889
people get to see your face and so if

862
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,350
they see you at a conference like yeah

863
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:33,750
it's creepy but yeah

864
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:36,929
yeah let's do some Network how-to videos

865
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,850
this is as easy as if you have a Mac you

866
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:42,540
can go in a QuickTime and say record

867
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:45,540
screen and just record screen and all

868
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,010
you're doing is for the next three to

869
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,560
nine minutes you're gonna record

870
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:52,200
yourself teaching people how you do a

871
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,240
thing if it's burp sweet you're just

872
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,310
gonna do burp sweet and if you're gonna

873
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,280
talk for four hours still break it into

874
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:02,370
three to nine minute segments because

875
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:06,120
people like searching for how-to videos

876
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:07,530
they go how to do this in burp and if

877
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,480
they find your video on YouTube they're

878
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:11,029
gonna watch it the how-to videos that

879
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,879
are like three minutes long have like

880
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:17,790
400,000 views and the webcast that we do

881
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,239
or that are 60 minutes long have 2,000

882
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:23,550
views do you know why because all of you

883
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,589
like everyone else looks at the runtime

884
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:30,419
of a video and goes no that's too much

885
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:33,659
of a commitment I got things to do even

886
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:37,739
at 3 minutes early you better teach me

887
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:39,570
something in 3 minutes and so as you're

888
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,199
thinking about making something for an

889
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,030
audience

890
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:44,609
like just make this three-minute video

891
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:46,350
and how easy is that you bring up quick

892
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,990
time you bring up the program you use

893
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,399
already and you just show something and

894
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:53,428
if you're thinking yourself yeah but

895
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,690
this is really simple exactly because I

896
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,310
see some college students in the

897
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,400
audience right now they're like could

898
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,660
you please make that three-minute video

899
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,090
because I don't know how to do the thing

900
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,200
is that you know how to do I meet

901
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,030
college students all the time and

902
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,799
they're like so how do I get started in

903
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,090
this industry well go watch a video that

904
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,470
I made a few years ago called how the

905
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:13,170
social engineer your way into your dream

906
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:15,240
job do that and then go on YouTube and

907
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,970
teach yourself how to do these things

908
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,859
what would be really nice though is if

909
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:23,098
you've made whatever it is that you're

910
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:24,630
using available in this description if

911
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,230
you have a peek at file that you're

912
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,420
looking at

913
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:30,510
make it a downloadable that people can

914
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:33,720
download and use if you're using a open

915
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:36,150
source program have a link to that open

916
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,618
source program if someone else created

917
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,180
an open source program but you know how

918
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,200
to use it better than they do because

919
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,149
they just made it and they haven't

920
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,069
really touched it since but it's the

921
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,720
thing that you use then become the

922
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,369
subject matter expert for that open

923
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:49,589
source tool and if anyone ever downloads

924
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:53,070
that tool and they don't know how to use

925
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:59,279
it they're gonna find your 47 3 minute

926
00:35:53,070 --> 00:36:01,859
videos on how to use that tool blogs if

927
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,640
you're writing a blog in and the thing

928
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:08,520
about writing a blog is bloggers if you

929
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,020
want to know how to write a blog every

930
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,650
blogger writes a blog on how to write

931
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,759
blogs this is not a hard thing to learn

932
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,859
because everyone's like well my first

933
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,380
blog is gonna be how to write a blog so

934
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:21,810
go find those but what I want you to

935
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,339
look at is search engine optimization so

936
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,710
if you have Google Analytics on your

937
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:28,619
blog start looking at what people are

938
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,970
searching for let's say you have 47

939
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,010
different blogs that you've written over

940
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:35,520
time but 10 of them are the most popular

941
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:38,640
ones and you're like why is that popular

942
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,990
so a black hose I'll I'll have a hard

943
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:46,440
time saying this l l m n are if you do a

944
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:49,560
search for el L M and our black hose

945
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,800
comes up as the second thing to read you

946
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:55,049
just type in L LM and r and there's a

947
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,230
blog about it is the most traffic blog

948
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:00,780
on our entire website every single month

949
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,330
because of Google search results you

950
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:06,319
know what we should do a webcast about L

951
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,788
L m and our

952
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:10,279
because that's what people are looking

953
00:37:07,789 --> 00:37:12,799
for and so as you write these over time

954
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:14,689
and that you have a Content library

955
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:16,519
that's building and you start looking at

956
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:17,928
the search results you will start seeing

957
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:19,308
what people are looking for and then

958
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:20,959
you'll start making things for what

959
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:22,549
people are looking for and I do

960
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:25,578
recommend that you put the words how-to

961
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:28,009
and your blog post because that's what

962
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:30,859
people look for they inherently go how

963
00:37:28,009 --> 00:37:33,979
to do a thing our blog posts that hat

964
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:36,199
start with kal to are the most traffic

965
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:39,870
blogs in our site the ones that have

966
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:42,360
catchy titles that were catchy

967
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:44,670
people don't really look for because

968
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,170
it's a catchy title and you're making

969
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,220
this for an audience you're not making

970
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:51,390
it for yourself you're making it for an

971
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:53,040
audience so it's how to do this when

972
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,690
you're coming with podcast I can also

973
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,850
tell you how to do a podcast but there's

974
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:59,910
also hundreds of thousands of podcasts

975
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:02,610
on how to make a podcast so go watch and

976
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:06,270
listen to those I said watch I mean some

977
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:08,490
people may record a video okay think

978
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,140
about consistency so when you go on

979
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,709
Spotify when you go on iTunes when

980
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:16,350
you're on Google POTUS if you were to do

981
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:19,200
a search for something on on those

982
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:22,350
places and they found your podcast if

983
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,600
the last time you did one was 18 months

984
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:28,560
ago do you think anyone's gonna listen

985
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:31,049
to it maybe but what people look for is

986
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,640
consistency they look for if I'm gonna

987
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:37,650
listen to this one thing is there gonna

988
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,180
be another one next week is it gonna be

989
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,430
one after that it's gonna be one after

990
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,620
that and even if it was recorded a week

991
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,299
and a half ago they may think I'll go

992
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:48,390
listen to that because it's new whose

993
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,530
current and if I don't get a chance to

994
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:52,560
talk about I'm gonna talk about right

995
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:55,220
now do not put anything on the internet

996
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:59,250
until you've made at least 20 of them

997
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:01,350
don't put a how-to video online don't

998
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:03,420
put a podcast online don't put a blog

999
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:06,390
online don't put anything online until

1000
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,980
you've made 20 of them and the reason

1001
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,589
why is because you're gonna be really

1002
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,300
excited after you leave this talk or if

1003
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,980
you just watched it on the Internet

1004
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,420
you're gonna be real excited like I'm

1005
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,770
gonna go share something that may I want

1006
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,690
to do a podcast or I'll do a blog I want

1007
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:21,040
to do a thing

1008
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:23,800
don't put anything on the internet so

1009
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,599
you've done 20 because that enthusiasm

1010
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,960
will fade real quick

1011
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:33,369
and you're right 1 you put your blog

1012
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,200
online you'll get the the the URL you'll

1013
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:37,930
open the Twitter account you'll create

1014
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,390
this you'll do all those things and then

1015
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:42,069
you make two of them because you didn't

1016
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,109
realize what time commitment it was

1017
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,450
gonna be or you didn't think they were

1018
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:48,130
good you thought they sucked and so you

1019
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,439
didn't make any more so what I'm

1020
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:53,530
encouraging you to do is make twenty of

1021
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,560
them and then start one at a time

1022
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:58,349
releasing them and that also helps you

1023
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,490
to if you want to go on vacation you

1024
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:01,840
want to go on vacation and still be

1025
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,819
consistent if you want to take a month

1026
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,640
off and still be consistent you can do

1027
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,890
that and then one other thing is instead

1028
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,830
of recording one podcast a week or one

1029
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:14,900
webcast a week or one how-to video week

1030
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:17,279
record six in one day

1031
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:20,339
because you at the time take one day off

1032
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:22,589
from work or take one day at PTO one day

1033
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:25,259
of this one day of that one Saturday and

1034
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:27,319
record six in a row you're already set

1035
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:30,539
up with a recording you're already in

1036
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:32,460
the mental space to do so so just keep

1037
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:34,499
recording them one after another after

1038
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:39,239
another after another and then release

1039
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:43,439
them one at a time that make sense live

1040
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:45,420
presentations tell a story I mean you

1041
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,009
could be as technical as possible and

1042
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,809
the reason why I gave a presentation on

1043
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:50,970
giving presentations a few years ago is

1044
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:53,730
because you all have something important

1045
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:55,499
to say and I mean that you haven't

1046
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,660
something important to say for the

1047
00:40:55,499 --> 00:41:00,299
safety of the entire world and the

1048
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,558
Internet's and all the stuffs you have

1049
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:04,140
something important to say

1050
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:09,420
I come from marketing we have nothing

1051
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:11,990
important to say we do not but we can

1052
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,780
say it really well

1053
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:19,759
that's what we're great we're great at

1054
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:23,599
saying uh nothing really great and your

1055
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:26,420
industries not as great at saying

1056
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,580
something that's important and so I

1057
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,640
highly recommend that you maybe go watch

1058
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:33,529
my talk from a few years ago or go watch

1059
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,270
other presenters and start looking at

1060
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:37,970
the thing that they do and it is tell a

1061
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,970
story they tell stories with a hook a

1062
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:44,330
beginning a middle class and an end and

1063
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:46,609
so structure your presentation what is

1064
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:48,560
my hook what is my beginning what is my

1065
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:50,950
middle what is the climax what is the

1066
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,020
thing I want people to remember the most

1067
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:55,879
and what is my end and if you can start

1068
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:58,460
telling a story then people will listen

1069
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:00,410
to your presentations and if you don't

1070
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,240
know where to get started take a blank

1071
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:05,990
sheet of paper and write the word hook

1072
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,500
beginning middle high max and end on the

1073
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:13,700
sheet of paper and then fill in the gaps

1074
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:17,359
whenever I do a CFP I write e5 sentence

1075
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:19,879
CFP I write e5 sentence abstract I read

1076
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,000
a five sentence email already five

1077
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,460
sentence thing a hook a beginning the

1078
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,520
middle a climax in the end because that

1079
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:31,580
is how human beings like to hear stores

1080
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:35,810
and so just structured like I said and

1081
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:37,190
CFP submissions so now you like I want

1082
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:40,099
to give a presentation but now you got

1083
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:42,080
to get past the CFP people the best way

1084
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,089
to get past the CFP people is to write

1085
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,319
it and hook beginning middle climax and

1086
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:46,940
then here's what I'm going to tell the

1087
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,900
audience is how I'm gonna start this is

1088
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,589
what I'm going to say next

1089
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:53,450
this is what the main takeaway is of my

1090
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:54,619
entire presentation and this is how I'm

1091
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,290
going to end it here's two takeaways

1092
00:42:54,619 --> 00:43:02,440
that I want people to know I have only

1093
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:02,440
been rejected from marketing conferences

1094
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:16,989
I just have this way of saying as

1095
00:43:13,689 --> 00:43:19,328
succinctly a yes or I'm saying something

1096
00:43:16,989 --> 00:43:23,709
that not other people are saying so what

1097
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:25,900
I'm saying to you is write your CFP and

1098
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:28,660
a hug beginning middle climax and end

1099
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:33,279
and keep it simple and then one last

1100
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:35,379
thing you do not need to figure out what

1101
00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:38,859
your talk is gonna be about and then

1102
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:41,109
submit you can submit a talk and then

1103
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:45,029
figure it all out before you give the

1104
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:47,410
presentation like all the rest of us do

1105
00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:48,999
live here if you're like wow this

1106
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,129
research is really amazing that the

1107
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:53,680
person is currently doing on stage they

1108
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,539
figured it out like four days ago

1109
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,279
hey that's when it all came together

1110
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:58,809
like they were really working on it but

1111
00:43:57,279 --> 00:44:01,270
that's like the time got closer like oh

1112
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:03,099
I really need to do this so I'm saying

1113
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:04,839
to you to if you have an idea for

1114
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:07,210
research you've got an idea for a talk

1115
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:09,460
then submit it and then figure it out

1116
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:13,569
before you have to give it cool all

1117
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,799
right good I am running out of time what

1118
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:16,420
I was going to say is we're gonna

1119
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:19,329
recreate something today we're gonna

1120
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,490
create a our own piece of content and so

1121
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:23,980
I'm gonna take the real quick the action

1122
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:25,959
figure podcast so let's say you're going

1123
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,099
to do an action figure podcast and so

1124
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,890
that's the content you're going to

1125
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:31,869
create and the reason why is because you

1126
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,058
want to give back to the community you

1127
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:35,020
love action figures and I know that some

1128
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:37,390
people in the audience right they're

1129
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:40,599
like I don't like action figures that's

1130
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:42,759
right most of you don't but the thing is

1131
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:44,410
you don't have to create content for the

1132
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,420
entire Internet to enjoy

1133
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:47,770
you only need to create content for the

1134
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,529
people who are gonna like the content

1135
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:52,869
that you create that makes sense and so

1136
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:54,490
so many of you right now are like well I

1137
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:56,470
want to do a thing but not many people

1138
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:58,118
are gonna like it that's fine you only

1139
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:01,058
need the people who are gonna like it to

1140
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:02,020
like it does that make sense and I know

1141
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:04,240
I keep sitting does that make sense

1142
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,140
because I need head not for validation

1143
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,140
of my cousin

1144
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,990
all right so production let's say you

1145
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,210
were gonna do a thing about action

1146
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,890
figures and you were going to unbox

1147
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:19,260
action figures and that's to show you

1148
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:21,299
were going to do and so you have a show

1149
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,400
about unboxing action figures but you're

1150
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,560
going to do it live because that's more

1151
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,880
exciting so you're gonna do it live so

1152
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,950
now you have to buy a camera buy the

1153
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,180
cheapest crappiest camera you can buy

1154
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:33,080
because you're only going to make one of

1155
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,080
these and then you lose enthusiasm

1156
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,400
if you make it past five get a better

1157
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:40,560
camera okay and so as you're recording

1158
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,810
this thing live you unboxing your

1159
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,430
favorite toy and like the excitement's

1160
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,110
on your face and like oh my god look and

1161
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,790
it comes with this accessory and this

1162
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,010
accessory look at the points of

1163
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,500
articulation this is incredible

1164
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,760
background I worked for DC Comics for a

1165
00:45:52,500 --> 00:46:01,740
little while in there action figure

1166
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:04,050
division I like alright and so you

1167
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,970
record it or you have it live and now

1168
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:07,890
people are tuning in for your livestream

1169
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:10,109
of you opening this thing and they're

1170
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,430
commenting like look at all that they

1171
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,740
are saying look at all the points of

1172
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:15,270
articulation look at all oh my god look

1173
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,560
at the act like in so it becomes a

1174
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,170
conversation it becomes a community

1175
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,360
based around the thing that you do and

1176
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,010
that's really cool and so now you're

1177
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,290
recording it you screen capture whatever

1178
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:28,380
it is and over time you're like you know

1179
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:29,880
what I should build my own studio with

1180
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,350
my own action figures up on the wall

1181
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,300
behind me of all the ones I've opened in

1182
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:35,490
the past and I can refer back to past

1183
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,830
episodes that people can tune in for and

1184
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:41,339
you start having the thing that people

1185
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:43,560
become you become known for and the one

1186
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:47,010
thing the tip from this is ah if you

1187
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:50,460
have it bad thing that you do like a bad

1188
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:53,190
show don't rerecord it put it on the

1189
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,290
Internet the reason why is because I

1190
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,600
heard a offer a few years ago said

1191
00:46:55,290 --> 00:47:00,960
there's nothing better than putting out

1192
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:05,089
bad stuff on the internet it will force

1193
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,090
you to get better really quickly

1194
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,400
post production this is your intro your

1195
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:13,339
outro you can pay someone to make this

1196
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,660
for you you go in fibre or one of those

1197
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:16,190
other places and say hey can you make a

1198
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:19,029
video intro for my action figure or

1199
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:21,710
website or my action figure livestream

1200
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:24,319
editing out the aahs the arms and these

1201
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:26,630
so's I recommend if you don't do this go

1202
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,859
find a Toastmasters group and your local

1203
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,720
community if you don't know its host

1204
00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:31,460
pastors is it's a place for you to get

1205
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,078
better at speaking and so you go to

1206
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:36,079
Toastmasters and you start learning that

1207
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:38,420
to take that the arms and the souls out

1208
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,550
you start being a better presenter I do

1209
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:43,369
recommend you do that and then one last

1210
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:45,559
tip for post-production is outsources if

1211
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:49,040
you hate the sound of your own voice pay

1212
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:50,869
someone to edit it for you it's a great

1213
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,300
way to take you out of the equation so

1214
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:55,250
you pay someone $50 to edit an episode

1215
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,809
for you especially a college student who

1216
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:02,450
needs the experience of learning how to

1217
00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:04,490
do this and then distribution so like I

1218
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,470
said earlier wait till you have 20

1219
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:08,118
finished things before you put it out

1220
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,879
for an audience unless it's a live

1221
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,799
stream and then just wing it if you're

1222
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,809
doing a live stream just wing it on

1223
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:16,400
iTunes you want people to review it so

1224
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,079
this is the one time you send an email

1225
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,760
out to everyone that you know and say

1226
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,700

please mom could you do this one thing

1228
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:31,339
for me here's the things I want you to

1229
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:34,308
say on YouTube it's important to tag

1230
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:35,990
things if you're doing a talk on infer

1231
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:37,730
if you don't a webcast and information

1232
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:40,520

1237
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:50,089
presentation you're going to show up on

1238
00:48:47,869 --> 00:48:52,460
the side of other presentations you

1239
00:48:50,089 --> 00:48:55,040

1240
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:57,079

1241

00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:05,089
alright and then your website WordPress

1243
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,460
Emily one minute gonna swim fast your

1244
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:09,700
email list the most three minutes that's

1245
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,700
which

1246
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:18,230
your email left a knee-jerk reaction

1247
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:20,390
right there your email list this becomes

1248
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,860
the most important tool for you over

1249
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,180
time as you make something you want to

1250
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,920
be able to email it out to your audience

1251
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,720
you have a new thing if you haven't seen

1252
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,890
it yet you should check it out people

1253
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,240
who give you their email really care

1254
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:34,100
because I mean this weekend you were

1255
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,450
here at this event and everyone was like

1256
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:40,640
hey can have your email you're like no

1257
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:41,870
no you can't that's mine so if you have

1258
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,730
people who are giving you their email

1259
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,319
they really care about the thing that

1260
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,390
you're making and then this other one

1261
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,740
joined forces if there's someone out

1262
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,049
there that's making something like they

1263
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:53,479
have an action figure podcast to join

1264
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:55,160
forces with them because yo get a part

1265
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,380
of their audience their audience to get

1266
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,960
a part of yours it's fantastic this is

1267
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:07,880
how youtubers did it from like 2007 to

1268
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:09,380
2012 they were doing joint forces the

1269
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:13,880
most important thing I want you to take

1270
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:15,170
away from this is that it doesn't matter

1271
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,770
if you have a hundred thousand followers

1272
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:20,720
if only ten people care if you have ten

1273
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,730
people and all of them care that's the

1274
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,950
most important part it's about

1275
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:27,260
engagement from the people who actually

1276
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:32,029
show up so it's not about big numbers

1277
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:35,510
it's about engagement and with my in

1278
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:38,330
conclusion this was so fast in

1279
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:40,910
conclusion the main takeaway from today

1280
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:43,430
if you only heard one thing it's please

1281
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:45,470
take the spirit of derbycon with you

1282
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:47,750
take the spirit of this community with

1283
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:49,370
you and please never deny someone the

1284
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:53,530
opportunity to learn the thing that's

1285
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:53,529
currently in your brain the knowledge
