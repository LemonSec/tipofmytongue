1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,540
video audio coming yeah sounds good

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,730
alright usually my voice carries pretty

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,519
well anyway so good afternoon everybody

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,320
I'm really excited to be here this is my

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,750
second Derby con first time speaking

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,970
here and just very excited to be here so

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,380
a little bit about myself I'm currently

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,150
an enterprise security architect at

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,769
Merck the pharmaceutical company now the

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,869
shipping company people tend to get us

11
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,639
mixed up I'm also an adjunct professor

12
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,130
at the University of North Carolina at

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,930
Charlotte because apparently I have

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,210
additional spare time I'm also a board

15
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,440
member of an organization called IT Pro

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,140
which is focused on professional

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,410
development for digital identity

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,750
employees I'm also an election precinct

19
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,620
official trying to keep our elections in

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,789
a County and North Carolina secure

21
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,468
hopefully it's obvious that the opinions

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,300
expressed here are my own I may tell

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,670
some stories regarding my employer but

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,019
they're still my own opinion and if you

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,030
need to reach me you can do so on

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,309
Twitter I will be publishing a copy of

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,750
these slides on SlideShare a little

28
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:09,600
while afterwards so as you can tell

29
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,820
there's another person or animal in that

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,169
picture and that's my girlfriend

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,490
I've had her for about ten years now and

32
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,119
so we're gonna start off with a little

33
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,380
bit of a horse story or rather actually

34
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:26,670
it's going to be horses and security

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,039
controls a a few years ago I gave a talk

36
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,530
that was inspired by an encounter with

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,369
this lovely little lady

38
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:37,020
her name is Pony and she figured out

39
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,320
that one of the gates that I thought I

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,079
had locked I did not and she got out and

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,048
I found out in the worst possible way

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,570
through a phone call from my wife who

43
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,950
heard from my neighbor so needless to

44
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,630
say that wasn't a good conversation but

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,610
as you can tell everything went well and

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:02:00,298
we made up I came back this year from a

47
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,149
trip to Europe and I was ready to you

48
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,219
know reengage with my horse and get

49
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,630
moving and this same gate

50
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,878
jumped into the conversation but for a

51
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,670
different reason I was working with her

52
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,540
in the arena and I asked her to do

53
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,179
something that as it turned out

54
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,170
horses have an opinion and she decided

55
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,099
she didn't want to do it and her way of

56
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,099
explaining that to me because everything

57
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,929
a horse tells you is feedback she

58
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:27,849
decided to jump that gate that I'm

59
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,040
pointing at or at least it appeared that

60
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:32,970
she jumped the gate now first of all I

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,659
had no idea my horse was that athletic

62
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,709
because if I did I probably wouldn't

63
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:37,209
bother because I don't really I don't

64
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:39,819
want to ride that athletic oven the

65
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,379
horse but I was more concerned because

66
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,599
she was limping a little bit after she

67
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:46,450
cleared into the pasture and so

68
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,280
naturally I'm panicking like I think

69
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,470
I've broken my horse I'm looking at this

70
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,450
gate yet again and I'm like alright

71
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,799
that's it we're putting up a wall

72
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:01,238
no-one's ever getting to that section of

73
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:06,000
fence ever again but then after I had

74
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:07,959
some time to calm down she was fine I

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,730
kind of remembered some of my own

76
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,409
learnings both in software development

77
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,540
and in security and one of the first

78
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:17,679
rules is you should seek to understand

79
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:20,858
the problem now part of it was yes her

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,299
feedback but what had really happened

81
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:24,340
and what you can see here in this

82
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:27,280
example was as it turned out the gate

83
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,909
wasn't closed my wife and I both were in

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,919
the ring and long story short may have

85
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:37,149
already failed that there was a gap

86
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,019
between the gate that I couldn't see

87
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,419
perceptively

88
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:41,949
and she jumped through that gap instead

89
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:43,930
of doing what I was asking her to do

90
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:46,150
which frankly wasn't that onerous but

91
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,379
she decided otherwise hence the

92
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,699
expression here so in addition to

93
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:53,018
understanding the problem really what we

94
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,639
should understand in that scenario is

95
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:56,340
what the risk is and that's really what

96
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,340
we're going to be talking about today is

97
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,829
under what circumstances is a wall

98
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,699
required and under what circumstances is

99
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:08,530
something as mundane as this required

100
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,569
ultimately the risk should define the

101
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,009
response so what does this have to do

102
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:15,970
with militia and two-factor

103
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:18,159
authentication and more importantly how

104
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,839
do we react when new threat actors or

105
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:21,728
new vulnerabilities come in I'm going to

106
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,080
target this contextually to two-factor

107
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,000
authentication but obviously there's

108
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,090
lessons that can be applied to

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,860
vulnerabilities as well and ultimately

110
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,810
as you saw in the story that I just told

111
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,180
you the idea of building a wall was a

112
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,280
little bit of overkill so when we first

113
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,890
have that initial temptation to panic as

114
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,570
a result of a security issue the first

115
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:44,830
thing we probably should do just stop

116
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,330
couldn't resist inserting my friend Neil

117
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,310
Patrick Harris there he's not really my

118
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,380
friend I'm just a fan so we're going to

119
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:53,020
talk about three areas today

120
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,990
one is this concept that I've created I

121
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,650
think I've been unable to find it on

122
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,730
Google so that means it's mine right

123
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,219
trademark office might disagree but it's

124
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,450
security panic theater then we're going

125
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,160
to take a look at the current state of

126
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,539
two-factor authentication or what I will

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,460
call it this current state of

128
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,400
authentication and then we'll talk about

129
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,260
what we do in terms of next steps so

130
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,750
with respect to security panic theater

131
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,340
everybody happy you probably attended

132
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,840
Jason's talk he talked about security

133
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,000
theater right everybody's pretty much

134
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,219
familiar with that idea you know it's

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,840
the idea that in spite of this mess

136
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,220
getting created and everybody's being

137
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,750
asked to do things that they probably

138
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,790
shouldn't have to do like take off their

139
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:34,450
shoes because there might be a bomb in

140
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,710
it the reality is what largely what

141
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,479
they're doing I think Jason had a slide

142
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,039
up there that said 70% of the fake

143
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,870
weapons that they tried to smuggle and

144
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:47,020
actually got through so but I can't help

145
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,270
but include this in in the presentation

146
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,400
because I think it just works to

147
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,440
describe security theater too well so if

148
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,659
you bring in too much liquid the TFA

149
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,760
confiscates it and throws it away in

150
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,030
case it's a bomb so they throw it away

151
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,340
in case it's a bomb in the garbage can

152
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:06,280
right next to them with all the other

153
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:09,580
possible bombs in the area with the most

154
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,500
possible amount of people in case it's a

155
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,620
bomb I promise that's the last time I

156
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,080
will read verbatim a slide but that joke

157
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,760
just works too well here but what we're

158
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,640
talking about with respect to security

159
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,830
panic theater is the temptation in the

160
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,349
media is just as complicit as we can be

161
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,020
sometimes and as soon as we hear about a

162
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,150
vulnerability zero-day in this case

163
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,719
we're going to be talking about you know

164
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:37,039
a pen testing toolkit called maliska our

165
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,830
temptation is to go from zero

166
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,920
Oh 210 with respect to the level of

167
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,330
panic that can ensue and as we see in

168
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,220
this headline that was written out in

169
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,930
full disclosure I get it

170
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,460
most of the folks that write these

171
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,200
articles don't get to choose their

172
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,270
headlines somebody wants something for

173
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,070
clickbait so I get that sometimes they

174
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,780
get it right sometimes they don't but in

175
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,180
this one they clearly state have we

176
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,530
defeated two-factor authentication

177
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,730
first of all I'm not sure that's even

178
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,320
possible and I'll tell you a little bit

179
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,630
why in a moment

180
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,730
but you know obviously it is a focus on

181
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,550
the challenge mode Leesha does translate

182
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:14,270
to mantas that's why I choose chose the

183
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,430
term eating our lunch but again the idea

184
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,859
should be let's try and condition

185
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,200
ourselves to not immediately going to

186
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,200
ten on the panic level when it comes to

187
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,520
evaluating a new security issue and to

188
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,920
do this we're going to take a historical

189
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,859
view pretty quick we're gonna look at a

190
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,210
crack of RSA and when I say say a

191
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,220
historical view it's really only in the

192
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,310
past few years that's been what's kind

193
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:41,060
of amazing with this journey is the

194
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:43,370
amount of stuff that pops up it almost

195
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,590
in real time I added two slides this

196
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,540
week because of responses that took

197
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,280
place and I'll point out the ones when

198
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,090
we get to them let's talk about ss7

199
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,739
we'll talk about SMS of course we'll

200
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,169
talk about time-based one-time passwords

201
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,060
we'll talk about the Google security key

202
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,580
flaw and you become and there's one more

203
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,050
I believe so

204
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,880
back in 2016 or I'm sorry 2012 some

205
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,890
security researchers in this ARS

206
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,570
technical headline is pretty you know

207
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,190
fair because this is what the

208
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:17,120
researchers were reporting we have

209
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:19,280
hacked our essays smart cards if we have

210
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,140
physical access to the device ok that's

211
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,679
your first kind of caveat on what the

212
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,900
actual risk is and we have access to the

213
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,600
key weakening strata extract the private

214
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,809
keys off the device that's what their

215
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:38,150
claim was RSA had kind of a different

216
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:39,919
take understandably so in you know

217
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,209
reading through the articles with

218
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,410
respect to this and all of these will be

219
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:48,380
cited at the end of the deck the reality

220
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,800
was much more nuanced than what the

221
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:54,720
security researchers were

222
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,760
presenting next with respective ss7 the

223
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,010
vulnerability on cell networks again

224
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,750
this is another scenario where yeah it's

225
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,640
a real vulnerability but you need

226
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,640
physical access to the network in order

227
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,350
to exploit it and oftentimes most of

228
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,130
your average attackers don't have that

229
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,570
that doesn't mean it's not a

230
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,490
vulnerability that's not something you

231
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,839
should respect certainly financial

232
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,880
institutions should pay very close

233
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,000
attention to it and it's another reason

234
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,529
why SMS probably should be you know we

235
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,730
should be migrating away from it but I

236
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:24,209
don't know that we necessarily should

237
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:27,360
kick it to the curb just yet and then

238
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:29,479
after that last year for those not

239
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,970
familiar NIST released an update to the

240
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,649
863 authentication standard and one of

241
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,940
the big things that got people's hair on

242
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:42,800
fire was NIST officially deprecated SMS

243
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,800
and most people were like good riddance

244
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,119
there's a lot of systems that still rely

245
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,600
on SMS as a second factor of

246
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,680
authentication and yes it's vulnerable

247
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,850
but it's still better than nothing

248
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:59,310
and so NIST had to actually print a

249
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,680
retraction saying look we're not saying

250
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,239
you don't use SMS ever we're not

251
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
recommending it as a method of

252
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,730
two-factor authentication for

253
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,189
out-of-band connectivity so again once

254
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,740
you start digging behind and getting

255
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:17,220
behind the panic or beyond the panic you

256
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:20,070
can find the truth and then of course

257
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,800
this week many of you who are on Twitter

258
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:25,170
I'm sure are aware that Jack Dorsey of

259
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,349
Twitter had his account hacked now

260
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,479
originally I and I owned some of the mud

261
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,550
on my face for this I assumed he got sim

262
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,070
jacked which actually was true and that

263
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,540
they used that to bypass his two-factor

264
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,300
authentication that was not the case

265
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,949
they were exploiting an application

266
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,899
authorization that would allow you to

267
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:46,140
send text messages to an address that

268
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,180
could serve as tweets but the

269
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:52,500
vulnerability is still there and Twitter

270
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,760
still allows you to use SMS as a method

271
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,070
of two-factor authentication they have

272
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,810
to much stronger methods either using

273
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:00,600
application based security for time

274
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,619
based or security keys which definitely

275
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,760
is you know if you

276
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,600
protecting your twitter account with

277
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,330
that you should be but anyway that

278
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,010
created again i wouldn't say quite a

279
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:15,540
panic ensued as much as it was just

280
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:18,390
around a bit of mocking especially of

281
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,910
the head of twitter so then we had

282
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,010
earlier this year google revealed that

283
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,959
their tightened security he's some

284
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,120
subsets of the ones that were produced

285
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,160
had a bluetooth vulnerability and again

286
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,540
so that this kind of added to the course

287
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,520
and this was after Mobley she had

288
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,959
already been announced so those chorus

289
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,560
of pundits were coming out saying you

290
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,480
know even the most secure one has a flaw

291
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,170
in it so we really probably shouldn't be

292
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,790
using it right answer obviously it was

293
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,740
no number one Google's going to replace

294
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,510
the key the keys are the strongest thing

295
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,990
you can use out there you should keep

296
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,360
using it if you have it and then of

297
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:58,650
course my favorite one because it's

298
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:03,450
personal Yubikey announced that some of

299
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:05,550
their line of FIPS keys had a

300
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,920
vulnerability but it was a really kind

301
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:10,349
of quirky vulnerability if the user had

302
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,209
already initialized the key they had

303
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,400
nothing to worry about that you actually

304
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:18,900
had to not only have physical access to

305
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,939
the key but you also had to the key had

306
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,970
to be unregistered and if you did that

307
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,010
then potentially you could exploit it

308
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,360
obviously e be key owned it very quickly

309
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,279
made an announcement and they're

310
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,610
replacing the line where it got personal

311
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,950
for me is we use ub keys at merck not in

312
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,839
his robust a fashion as I would like but

313
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,760
our Incident Response Teams were

314
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,529
pounding my inbox very quickly saying

315
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,380
you know do we need to do recall and is

316
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,330
like guys very simple email we do not

317
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,550
use the FIPS line as a ruby keys no

318
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,420
further action is required good news was

319
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:53,609
our incident response trusted that so

320
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,810
again seeing the panic ensue and get I

321
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,589
didn't get any panicked phone calls

322
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:01,290
thankfully but ultimately you know Neal

323
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:03,060
tells you let's just stop that so with

324
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,459
that historical view in mind let's take

325
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,319
a look at the current two-factor or what

326
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,689
I should say is the authentication

327
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,360
landscape and what you'll see here is

328
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,190
you know you know about the three types

329
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,450
of factors there's what you know which

330
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:19,290
is your password your pen

331
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:21,390
what you have and then something you are

332
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,520
or some people have argued that

333
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,660
behavioral should be a fourth category I

334
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,990
put it kind of in the biometric

335
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,280
signature category that fertile ground

336
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,890
for discussion and certainly not a

337
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,980
critical issue in this talk what's

338
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,660
interesting to me is number one when

339
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,330
they say two-factor authentication has

340
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:44,189
been defeated did they defeat all of

341
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:46,860
them they got close out of all those

342
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,110
methods all the ones in red have at

343
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,330
least some known vulnerability to them

344
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:54,390
and some of them may be inherent to the

345
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,670
design like SMS but some of them may be

346
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,530
hey these need to change like even smart

347
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,349
cards have a vulnerability about local

348
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,540
caching but they're still considered

349
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,080
that you know the gold standard when it

350
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,060
comes to authentication so and this list

351
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,560
by no means is is exhaustive if there's

352
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,300
ones that I should add on there by all

353
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,189
means reach out to me I would love to

354
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,890
include it I'm hoping to translate this

355
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:20,100
into a paper eventually in my infinite

356
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,930
spare time so what do we do about all

357
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,040
this information and we're going to look

358
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,219
at this through a couple of questions

359
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,890
the first one is how effective is

360
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,510
two-factor authentication already now as

361
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,970
I've seen through the Twitter feed for

362
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,710
derbycon and through Jason's talk when

363
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,830
an attacker says that they hate a

364
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,720
control that means it's a good thing

365
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,330
right

366
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,160
I'm going to take that as a yes but

367
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:47,460
javelin talk about the javelin study

368
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,469
Google discuss briefly the fact that

369
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,510
throughout history technology will

370
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,640
always develop weaknesses because people

371
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:55,050
are always trying to innovate and

372
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,810
honestly the biggest threat to

373
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,990
two-factor authentication is how good is

374
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,939
your account recovery because if an

375
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,610
email can buy patch or two-factor

376
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,400
authentication it's not really that

377
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,720
strong and unfortunately a lot of

378
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,819
vendors who have implemented even

379
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,820
security key based authentication you

380
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:18,180
can recover your account with an email

381
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:21,480
that's a problem so let's take a look at

382
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:24,540
javelin this was a study javelin as a

383
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,310
research firm commissioned by Fido so

384
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,969
you kind of look at that anything okay

385
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,290
you know fox guarding the hen house

386
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,790
but what they were really trying to

387
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,969
examine was what the rate of adoption

388
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,920
was for cryptographically stronger

389
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,540
methods of authentication and they did

390
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,579
note some good findings it's increased

391
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,740
threefold for consumers and it's

392
00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:45,290
increased almost 50% for enterprises so

393
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:47,569
that's certainly encouraging from what

394
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,930
I've seen and phyto certainly

395
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:52,729
or rather Javelin confirms this PSD to

396
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,430
has been probably the biggest driver

397
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,920
behind two-factor adoption

398
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,410
GDP are certainly has has had an impact

399
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,209
as well the one thing I would have loved

400
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,370
a scene out of this study and it's true

401
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:05,979
the Google study as well is what was

402
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:09,230
their account takeover rate before

403
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,569
two-factor was enabled because to me

404
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,980
from a scientific method perspective you

405
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:17,360
know you want to do the before and after

406
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,740
right so with respect to the Google

407
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,720
study and I apologize this might be a

408
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,500
little hard to read but the bars will

409
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,720
kind of give you a sense of what the

410
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,029
effectiveness is what they found was and

411
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,350
and these are pretty stunning you see

412
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,449
the knowledge-based challenges on the

413
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,160
right so this is the classic

414
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,258
knowledge-based authentication if I

415
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,089
can't figure out my password what was

416
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:40,129
your mother's maiden name where was your

417
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:42,740
father born all stuff that can be very

418
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:46,279
easily socially engineered and you can

419
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,829
see the account takeover rages even

420
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:51,500
that's kind of good so it's not horrible

421
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:53,689
but it's certainly not as good as what

422
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,430
you see on the left where for device

423
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:57,290
based challenges if they're either using

424
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,699
an on device prompt like in the case of

425
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,910
Google you could send a push

426
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:04,819
notification to the Google app itself

427
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,649
even an SMS code for broad spectrum

428
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:12,428
attacks it was a hundred percent

429
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:15,439
effective yes that that's their claim

430
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:19,309
100 percent is good even if that number

431
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:22,640
is a little off again and I suspect the

432
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:25,280
audience kind of shares this opinion SMS

433
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,360
is always going to be better than no

434
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:32,990
two-factor at all but one of the things

435
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,990
that impressed me was even in the SMS

436
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:38,620
space even a highly targeted attack you

437
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,270
still wound up with a 74 percent

438
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:44,120
prevention rate that's pretty good

439
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,889
so when we go back to the militia good

440
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,830
discussion and don't get me wrong

441
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,510
militia go was number one it's a

442
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,490
pentesters dream because it's very easy

443
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,960
to set up it's easy to automate and

444
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,610
that's what it was originally designed

445
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,350
for but we know hackers are going to get

446
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:59,928
a hold of it and so it can't become a

447
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,600
weapon against users but if these tools

448
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:05,350
are that effective you know how much

449
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,030
panic do we apply to what happened with

450
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:09,800
the release of this toolkit and what was

451
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,660
obviously also noteworthy was the

452
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,370
hundred percent success rate for all

453
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,280
three attack methods when it came to

454
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,379
using a security key now again this is

455
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:22,820
Google I would love to see what their

456
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:26,090
ATO rate was prior to the study before

457
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:28,970
especially before you know they did

458
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,970
beyond trust or not beyond trust there's

459
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,160
zero trust initiative so I found this

460
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,170
quote and I thought it was pretty useful

461
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,210
I'm not going to read it to you but

462
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,850
basically not using 2fa is far more

463
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:44,780
damaging than using one that has some

464
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:46,490
flaws with them now that may vary in

465
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,710
your enterprise in terms of what your

466
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,330
risk is I work for a pharmaceutical

467
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,400
company where we have some fairly

468
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,689
sensitive intellectual property so

469
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,490
there's going to be some areas where I

470
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:59,480
want the highest controls possible to

471
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:03,260
prevent data leakage however I also have

472
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:06,770
functions where you know I get read

473
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,150
access to reports on infrastructure how

474
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:12,080
much of a level of control do I need

475
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:14,059
there ultimately attackers will always

476
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,439
find a way even with the newest stander

477
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:19,309
today I didn't really talk about fight

478
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,720
o2 at the beginning when I was talking

479
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:22,250
about the profiles but fight or two

480
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,679
combined with web authentication I think

481
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,750
it's pretty exciting and I think has an

482
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:30,380
opportunity to and this is not a pitch

483
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,420
for them I'm not a member of phyto but I

484
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,540
think it has the opportunity to really

485
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:37,520
improve broad spectrum use of security

486
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,889
not just security keys

487
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,720
but letting your phone become a much

488
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:46,280
stronger Authenticator than just simply

489
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:49,400
receiving a text message so where do we

490
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,250
go from here well first as I reiterated

491
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,240
a number of times let risk be your guide

492
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,919
look at the assets within your

493
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,330
organization and don't necessary

494
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,570
they think of a single method of

495
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,859
two-factor authentication for your users

496
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,570
at Merck we have three different methods

497
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:07,939
obviously I'm not going to tell you what

498
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:09,379
the L are maybe over a beer bourbon but

499
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,639
don't necessarily think in terms of a

500
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:12,109
silver bullet and that's what a lot of

501
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:15,289
the vendors will try and sell you use

502
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:16,580
this your problem solved the other piece

503
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:18,499
that I would like to couple with this

504
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,989
and this is still an emerging capability

505
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:23,409
in the markets is the ability to apply

506
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:25,789
risk in real time to your authentication

507
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:27,350
transaction we do that a little bit

508
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:29,419
today the banks are better at it

509
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,609
where if all of a sudden I show up in

510
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:33,529
Prague seven hours from now so I've

511
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:36,259
broken you know time speed barriers

512
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:37,549
they're gonna go hey I'm gonna put your

513
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:39,259
card on hold for a minute while you try

514
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:40,730
and buy that cheeseburger I've been

515
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:42,350
surprised at the number of burgers they

516
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,570
sell in Prague I don't know why that is

517
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,309
but it's a favorite thing but instead

518
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:50,480
consider a buffet of options on that and

519
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:54,190
then finally as you get vulnerabilities

520
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,190
do three things first of all obviously

521
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,179
next collaborate I only throw ID Pro up

522
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,739
here for a shameless promotion but

523
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:02,480
obviously there's other organizations

524
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:03,889
there's other peers being at this

525
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,239
conference as an opportunity to

526
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:07,399
collaborate with people and talk about

527
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:10,190
what these threats are and you thought I

528
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:12,469
was going to say listen vanilla ice was

529
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,269
last year right do your research and do

530
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,090
research with other people find out what

531
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:19,190
that's going to look like also some sage

532
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:22,009
advice from April right this happened a

533
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:24,379
few days ago basically just put your

534
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:29,659
effort in your controls where they

535
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:33,709
belong I understand what your risk is so

536
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:36,440
in summary ultimately we talked about

537
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,690
letting risk be your guide I'm having

538
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,950
trouble reading this apologies on the

539
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:44,480
colors as vulnerabilities emerge to what

540
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,700
we just talked about technology will

541
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,679
always gain vulnerabilities history

542
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,309
proves this that's why we have teams on

543
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:55,039
both sides for enterprises and I know

544
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:58,279
Jason talked about this a little bit and

545
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:01,039
his talk embrace to FA internally and

546
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:03,080
I've been surprised as I've surveyed my

547
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,220
peers the number of enterprises that

548
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:10,610
don't adopt to FA internally the

549
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,230
that just has to change the old saying

550
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,770
the perimeter is gone has been true for

551
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:18,010
probably about a decade now for

552
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,240
consumers you add to fa where you can

553
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,370
but also create solid recovery

554
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,650
alternatives if they offer it and then

555
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,469
finally I would encourage us to consider

556
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:29,540
killing the to and to FA if web

557
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,070
authentication and phyto to can achieve

558
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,870
the level that it needs that could

559
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,210
become your primary method you have

560
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,370
backup methods but not all methods are

561
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,960
required at the time of authentication I

562
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,000
think we can get there pretty quickly

563
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,710
this is the other version of killing

564
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,410
passwords and I think we're a lot closer

565
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:49,670
there than we realize and as I mentioned

566
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,350
those are the resources I will be

567
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,700
publishing those and be happy to

568
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:59,649
entertain any questions I think we only

569
00:22:52,700 --> 00:23:02,270
have like a minute or two or two yes

570
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,830
like I said I will be publishing these

571
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:29,090
on SlideShare so you're welcome to them

572
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:32,720
yes sir the short version of that answer

573
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:35,689
is create more authenticators for

574
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,150
example I am for any account that I that

575
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:40,130
the technology vendor allows it I have

576
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,260
multiple keys assigned to it so that if

577
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,750
I lose one Yubikey I have a backup

578
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,310
Hibiki to do that because those backup

579
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,890
account recovery processes are

580
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:53,330
inherently weak and any social engineer

581
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:54,880
will be able to get past them any other

582
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,570
questions

583
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,570
well thank you very much
