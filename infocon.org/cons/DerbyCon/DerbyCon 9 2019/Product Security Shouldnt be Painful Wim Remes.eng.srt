1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:15,120
not yet I'm getting in queue awesome so

2
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,369
all welcome to my talk called product

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,288
security shouldn't be painful I've been

4
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,448
doing this public speaking thing for 10

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,449
years and it's still painful to me

6
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:28,500
especially if you you're talking on the

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,060
last day of the last derbycon which was

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,779
to me an awesome conference it's also my

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,969
first derbycon

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:39,149
so who else is its first derbycon

11
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:42,210
awesome all enjoyed it awesome

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,399
I think Dave Dave and his crew has done

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,140
something very special with daruka and I

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,370
think we cannot be nothing but thankful

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,289
I don't have any slides about me I also

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,610
don't have any slides having my personal

17
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,710
details because I don't feel that

18
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,210
talking at a conference is about me it's

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,210
about sharing information it's about

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,069
sharing ideas and hoping that other

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,960
people pick that up and work with it if

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,850
you want my contact details I mention

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,770
them at the end of the talk don't

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,559
hesitate to walk up after the talk and

25
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,740
share your details or ask questions

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,759
whatever

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,169
the thing I'm sharing today a a lot of

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,080
people share research that have spent

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,939
three months six months a year on when I

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,820
was making this talk I realized that

31
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:33,720
it's mostly a combination of all the

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,579
experiences that have gathered over more

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,189
than 20 years working in IT and in

34
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:43,220
security because it's a very mixed set

35
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,720
of things that I've tried to apply here

36
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,450
it's based on a project that I've did

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,820
with my company called wire security

38
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,310
that's the only only logo you will see

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,889
in the slides as well is on the front on

40
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:00,149
the first slide what we try to do at

41
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,700
wire security is let me drag back a

42
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:07,380
little bit when I started my career I

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,330
was just a printer installer for for a

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,370
bank I installed printers much like

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,290
Boris still does however I

46
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,810
always challenge myself and try to find

47
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,420
things that interested me but it also

48
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,480
put me out of my comfort zone when I

49
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:26,420
found out wire security I defined what

50
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,679
we do as attacking wicked problems and

51
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,890
wicked problems are basically very

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,599
complex problems that nobody wants to

53
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,089
wants to address or can address so

54
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,250
somehow I always find a way to put in

55
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,120
the right people with the right mindsets

56
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,140
and the right skill sets to solve those

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,900
difficult problems so we don't just

58
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,108
write policies like everybody does and

59
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:51,349
we also don't do a lot of standard

60
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:54,859
projects in in this case we were asked

61
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:56,988
by a client to develop a framework that

62
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:59,959
allowed them to implement security in

63
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:01,730
their product development lifecycle now

64
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,390
when we talk about products

65
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,470
it's obviously the Internet of Things

66
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,809
everybody knows that it's a lot of

67
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,970
things that are connected now and we're

68
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,000
talking cars we're talking watches we're

69
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:19,609
talking toothbrushes and we're also

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,730
talking medical devices now when you see

71
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:24,709
lot of talks about hardware hacking it's

72
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:28,790
always I got this device I got physical

73
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:30,859
access I extracted to the firmware and

74
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,400
then I reprogrammed it and I did fancy

75
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:36,590
stuff with it I ran Doom on a screen

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,810
product security is much more complex

77
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,230
than just putting a device on the market

78
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,949
it's it's a it's quite quite a long

79
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:47,869
process however it is not magical there

80
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:49,669
are standard processes that have existed

81
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:54,109
for ages that are applied within

82
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:55,849
companies to to create products it's not

83
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,739
like seven seven vendors at the same

84
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:59,750
time suddenly come up with a connected

85
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,329
connected camera and they all put it on

86
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,569
the market at the same time the standard

87
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:11,269
process that we are looking at is you've

88
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:13,448
mostly to two sources of products first

89
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:17,019
somebody or a group comes up with an ID

90
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:19,789
the research and development and then

91
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,739
testing the results of that testing flow

92
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:22,969
back to research and developments in the

93
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:25,340
end you end up with a bill of materials

94
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:27,260
which is critical if you talk about

95
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,000
product development and also what

96
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,120
makes it difficult to make changes after

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,060
that point because you have all the

98
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,400
parts that make your product and making

99
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,870
changes after that means going back to

100
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,630
the to the beginning creating a new Bill

101
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:46,910
of Materials talking to your vendors

102
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:49,340
that that build your products or that

103
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,380
that produce produce them and make

104
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,859
changes to their their development

105
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,930
processes and in the end you have a rule

106
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,730
out in your product hits the markets and

107
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,280
in many cases people have forgot stuff

108
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:07,160
and cannot change them anymore

109
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:10,729
but that's a general process but there

110
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,370
is more when you start talking to

111
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,500
product development teams there are a

112
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,900
lot of rules that apply to the work they

113
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,880
do when it comes to medical devices for

114
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:26,419
instance there are FDA rules there are

115
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:29,810
what they call C XP and it's just a

116
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:34,580
broad set of compliance rules that they

117
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,460
have to adhere to and what I do first

118
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,169
when I enter this type of projects

119
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,419
because in the end we all have the

120
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,040
hacker mindset the most important thing

121
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,780
to me is to understand what the

122
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,370
restrictions are that are applied to

123
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:51,080
what those people do so we learn all the

124
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,140
rules we go through all the regulations

125
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,570
it's a lot of reading we often also read

126
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:01,760
the RFC's of all the protocols that they

127
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:04,580
are supposed to use because once we know

128
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,550
what the rules are we can subtly break

129
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,900
them or we can adapt what we want to

130
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:17,360
implement to how the employees are

131
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:20,030
restricted and then what is also

132
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,190
important to important to remember and a

133
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,580
returning team at security conferences

134
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:28,219
is always the user is bad

135
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,590
developers are bad I would contest that

136
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,860
there is no person that walks or no

137
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,890
developer or any person that walks into

138
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,380
a company wait there are not many

139
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,120
persons there are some for sure that

140
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,340
walk into a company

141
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,500
and say today I'm gonna write that code

142
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,859
or today I'm gonna develop bad products

143
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,990
they all most of them have good

144
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,229
intentions and we have to understand how

145
00:06:50,990 --> 00:07:00,650
they work to make sure that the way they

146
00:06:54,229 --> 00:07:03,409
work are is the most secure way now in

147
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,060
this case we were working with two main

148
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,650
main audiences and I've studied

149
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,949
communications a little bit when I was

150
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,448
in high school understanding the

151
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,550
audience's that you're working with is

152
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:17,150
critical to success if you want to

153
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,820
change culture I'm not a big believer in

154
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,479
awareness training and security

155
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:26,330
awareness and security culture because

156
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:31,180
security for me is never the primary

157
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,180
thing yeah you have to apply security

158
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,490
within the culture that exists and

159
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,440
there's no such thing as making

160
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,729
everybody watch the same standard videos

161
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,160
and then hoping that they were all do

162
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,930
the right thing you have to be

163
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,400
supportive you have to be consultative

164
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,430
and you have to understand your

165
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,969
audiences so in this case we have two

166
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:55,310
may main audiences on the on my right

167
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,560
your left there are the managers that

168
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,139
are not technical that are interested in

169
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,520
in certain things but definitely not

170
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:07,789
whether there is a vulnerability of CBS

171
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,799
s10 they don't care they want a product

172
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:12,010
on the market that can make them money

173
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,320
they also don't want to get fired and

174
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,090
then you have the developer and I used

175
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,250
to very stereotypical image there I'm

176
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:24,109
sorry for that but they all look like

177
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:27,050
that right and they're interested in

178
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,330
challenging problems but also in in

179
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,270
doing good work the worst thing you can

180
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,968
have when you work with a developer is

181
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,559
to be at the end of the whole cycle and

182
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,089
be the bad guy that does a pen test and

183
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,750
then tells them that all the things

184
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:43,900
they've done are wrong if if you as a

185
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,420
security professional or a security team

186
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,069
work with your developer you want to be

187
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,910
consultative you want to be supportive

188
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,700
you want to give them as much

189
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,459
information as possible you also want to

190
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,050
limit the red tape

191
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,410
there always needs to be some red tape

192
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:04,359
but you have to have to adapt it to what

193
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:07,480
I want to do now the managers first

194
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,430
thing they're interested in is money we

195
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,620
talk a lot about security metrics and

196
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:16,359
then we see dashboards that say we had

197
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:18,520
so many attacks we had these in these

198
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,420
forensics and investigations they don't

199
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:25,089
care they are interested in if you are

200
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,300
efficient and if you're not spending too

201
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,790
much money if your security processes in

202
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,609
him inhibit them from making money then

203
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:36,010
you have a problem not them the same

204
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,740
thing with time if they are thinking

205
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,360
about making a product they're thinking

206
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,050
about getting it to the market as fast

207
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,880
as possible

208
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,529
you are thinking about getting getting

209
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,620
it to the market as secure as possible

210
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:49,630
so you have to align your what you want

211
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,630
and try to get as much as possible out

212
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:58,450
of that relationship with the management

213
00:09:52,630 --> 00:10:00,910
team just to reminder if you have any

214
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,490
questions along the way don't mind

215
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,319
raising your hands I rather have this as

216
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,900
an interactive session than just answer

217
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,430
questions at the end or you're walking

218
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:15,339
away with questions that are not

219
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:18,640
answered now this guy and that's the

220
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:20,470
story too stereotypical the developer in

221
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,959
many cases I've seen processes where

222
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,950
they build guardrails they've actually

223
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,359
not let the developer free but they

224
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,740
would say you can only develop in this

225
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,720
language you have to do this and this

226
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,170
and this this and this in this way I

227
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,320
believe much more in telling them what

228
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,510
to do but not how to do it so we end up

229
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,430
and you will see that later with with

230
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:45,250
checklists that we share with product

231
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,349
developers that tell them what to do but

232
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,270
they're very much free in how to do it

233
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,360
the benefit of that is that you have

234
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,890
different development teams within your

235
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,390
organization and they start to share

236
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,089
what they have learned and what they

237
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,339
have developed but they still have the

238
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:04,440
freedom to do something different as

239
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:04,440
well as long as the end goal is reached

240
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:14,940
good what I never want to do is reinvent

241
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,380
the wheel

242
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,820
I'm definitely never the smartest guy in

243
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,490
the room and there's a lot of people

244
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:24,880
that I've done work before me or before

245
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:27,460
us that have done awesome things and we

246
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,950
need to take that information and try to

247
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,630
apply it to what we do today maybe

248
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,400
improve it but we're not reinventing the

249
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:38,110
wheel we're working with what exists

250
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:41,230
right now so you're working with a lot

251
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,550
of technical people and if you enter an

252
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,910
organization and the development team

253
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:48,579
has not been focused on security they

254
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:51,130
literally have no clue they know how to

255
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,930
develop but they have no clue how to

256
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,850
address a cross-site scripting they

257
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,310
don't have to they don't have any idea

258
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:00,760
how to create a process for secure

259
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:03,130
updates and they are looking themselves

260
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,560
because it frustrates them it's first

261
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,660
prizm before because they they get

262
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,000
pressure from their managers they have

263
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,010
to do more security they don't they

264
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,260
don't know where to look and they have

265
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,600
no guidance so in the beginning they

266
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:21,580
start looking at what already exists we

267
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:24,790
have the OS top-10 we have the mitre C

268
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:27,820
cwe common weakness weaknesses

269
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:32,589
enumeration if I'm not mistaking and

270
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:34,240
then we have the ASVs now a lot of most

271
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,400
of these things in my opinion are

272
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,960
targeted at security people they are not

273
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:44,260
targeted at developers and developers in

274
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,900
this talk is a synonym for product

275
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,850
developers in the indian producing

276
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,300
software or producing a product that is

277
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:55,060
that is physical it's not very much not

278
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,699
very much different so they start

279
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,540
looking at this and especially the ASVs

280
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,640
is focused on testing on verification

281
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:07,990
and that's not what their top estate

282
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,990
they want they need to know what what

283
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:15,010
they have to do to meet those

284
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:18,290
requirements so the first step I took in

285
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:21,259
this project is basically break

286
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:24,740
all of those requirements down and make

287
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:27,290
them into checklists so developers could

288
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,910
come to the security team and say well

289
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,130
isn't this problem what do I need to do

290
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:41,870
well check this and this these in these

291
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:43,569
boxes and you should be good yes yes

292
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:46,569
very much

293
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:46,569
hmm

294
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,459
so the question was if it is if there is

295
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:55,639
a way to apply this in agile processes

296
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:57,380
so the the same thing applies the slide

297
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,399
where I said learn all the all the rules

298
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,810
and then break them learn the rules of

299
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,579
development within an organization

300
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,130
whether they use waterfall or agile or

301
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:10,810
another methodology is part is part of

302
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:17,180
this and I think the next slide actually

303
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:22,180
covers this quite a bit so in in in many

304
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:26,239
cases i I kind of call this the the

305
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,939
PowerPoint if occasion of business some

306
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,180
somehow we always define a process as a

307
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,220
linear as a linear representation

308
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,649
there's a group of boxes with arrows

309
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,750
between them and there's a beginning and

310
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:43,279
an end that's not that's not how this

311
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:46,339
works so what we did here was basically

312
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:50,060
take all the processes that that work at

313
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:52,250
different points in time and understand

314
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,369
which processes need to need which

315
00:14:52,250 --> 00:15:01,899
inputs which processes generates which

316
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:05,449
outputs and where do outputs are used

317
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:09,380
another thing that this allowed us

318
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,670
allowed us to do is make the process as

319
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,610
simple as possible

320
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:16,160
I work as a virtual CEO for some

321
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:19,370
companies and there's a lot of clients

322
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,709
nowadays that sense those standardized

323
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,510
information gathering documents who has

324
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:25,040
heard of those

325
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:32,810
do you send them out or do you fill them

326
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:34,969
in okay did you like that so those those

327
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,839
six if you don't know them they're

328
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:41,480
basically taking ISO 27001 and they

329
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,139
create 300 or more questions that you

330
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,300
have to fill in

331
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:46,310
now imagine multiplying that with the

332
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,810
amount of customers that you have so for

333
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,060
each customer you're filling in an excel

334
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,540
sheet with 300 questions which takes you

335
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:54,529
between four and six hours every time

336
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,660
that's not what you want for your

337
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:59,120
developers you don't want 300 questions

338
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:04,279
that they have to spend time on that it

339
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:07,779
could be spending on improving your

340
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:12,560
products now back back to this slide I

341
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:15,170
think the most important parts are the

342
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,589
the second box from the left and it's

343
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:24,260
quite small on my screen right I was not

344
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:26,540
supposed to move this so we basic

345
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:31,189
reiated a product security and privacy

346
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:36,170
matrix which is a set of questions that

347
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:38,269
allowed us to rate the product that they

348
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,389
were developing on a scale of one to

349
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:43,190
four from there they got recommendations

350
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:47,649
from from us or guidance on how to

351
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:49,760
develop or what security and privacy

352
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:53,649
requirements they had so they could do

353
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:56,990
that from from the design phase on and

354
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:59,269
then those same requirements were used

355
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,190
at the assessment at the end so there's

356
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:05,359
no discrepancy with what between what

357
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:07,790
the expectations were then generating

358
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:12,918
metrics and metrics are important for

359
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:14,659
the other audience the the management

360
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:16,400
teams they want to know what for

361
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,870
instance the product coverages you

362
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,150
implement this and it's not like

363
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:22,188
magically for 100 products you developed

364
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:26,419
now you have product security in all

365
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:29,030
your products so coverage then the

366
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:30,980
different levels those are all metrics

367
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:34,908
that were gathered and created into a

368
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,830
dashboard for for the management team

369
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:37,340
but also for the product security teams

370
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,520
because

371
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:43,100
if you have multiple products there is

372
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,930
some level of gamification that allows

373
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,000
you to to drive the project development

374
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,560
teams better if one is doing a really

375
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,250
good job that shows in the metrics as

376
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:56,600
well and you don't want to be it you

377
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:59,450
don't want that to be some kind of cage

378
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:03,889
match but you want to use that as some

379
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:07,180
some kind of driver to improve then

380
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,800
definitely that the pass/fail criteria

381
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,380
using those checklists and reusing those

382
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,570
checklists in the verification are very

383
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,670
clear one of the most annoying things

384
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,610
and I think everybody shares that

385
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:21,650
opinion is when you ask someone for

386
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,120
feedback and they're not answering yes

387
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,730
or no they are not giving an answer

388
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,360
right that happens with security teams

389
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,950
all the time I think one of the things

390
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,290
that is very important is to give clear

391
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,090
answers so if they have failed feel

392
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,370
great for for their security

393
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:40,490
requirements you have to give them the

394
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,939
feedback that they need to improve again

395
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:46,670
focusing on not telling them what to do

396
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:50,870
but how no not telling them how to do it

397
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:54,830
but telling them what to do so this

398
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,830
moves to basically a spreadsheet and I

399
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,840
hate spreadsheets it's the easiest

400
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:03,460
representation if you're implementing

401
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,820
this there are whether you're using

402
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:09,950
Google suite or office 365 there's

403
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,980
something like forms in both

404
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,080
applications I'm not mistaking that that

405
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,630
you can use to automate this so they

406
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,389
only have to go to a webpage fill in

407
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,700
everything you get in a reminder when

408
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:25,970
it's filled in and the process very much

409
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:30,140
automated you don't really want to send

410
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:31,820
them an excel sheet and then wait until

411
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:37,850
that excel sheet comes back you want to

412
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:40,990
make it again as easy as possible you

413
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:44,510
see that there's not that many questions

414
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:46,310
we use very direct questions mostly as a

415
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:49,160
no questions that gives them information

416
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,800
about what type of product it is how

417
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,400
critical it is for the business

418
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,520
what type of information is processes

419
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:03,550
and that gives gives us rating that are

420
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:06,280
color coded on the on your left and then

421
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:10,629
I still think this is one of the most

422
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:14,379
ingenious things I've done actually very

423
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:17,770
proud of that color coding it looks very

424
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,840
stupid but we basically took the took

425
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:24,520
the ASVs

426
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:29,949
and we we didn't follow the is vs levels

427
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:32,980
because they are mostly focused on on

428
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,480
the verification part but we aligned

429
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,580
with the levels that we defined for the

430
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,930
for the organization and then we

431
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,760
color-coded the slides we split

432
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,060
everything up in those different levels

433
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,310
and when we determined that something is

434
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,500
a level one we sent the developers all

435
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:49,270
the green slides when we know it's a

436
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,780
level two we send them the yellow in the

437
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,129
green slice and they pretty much know

438
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,210
what to do with that and that's

439
00:20:54,130 --> 00:21:00,760
something that's very very much

440
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:06,580
appreciated actually thinking I'm going

441
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:11,310
way too fast here any questions at the

442
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,310
moment yes

443
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:33,920
yes for me complete freedom so the

444
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:37,550
question if I'm repeating it as well as

445
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,200
I can how far do you go putting those

446
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:42,230
guard cartwheels off what are what are

447
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,470
the restrictions do you go as far as not

448
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,360
limiting the choice of any languages

449
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:50,150
yes the there's as much freedom as

450
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,949
possible I think the worst thing is

451
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,920
having a development organization where

452
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,420
you say we're developing all these kinds

453
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,700
of projects but you can only use Java

454
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:02,390
that is the one of the stupidest things

455
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,070
you can do if a developer knowing that

456
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:08,030
they are an expert just as well as you

457
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:09,980
are an expert on on security they they

458
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,200
are an expert on on development knowing

459
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,360
what the upsides and downsides are of

460
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,130
the different languages and they have to

461
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,949
choose what works for work then they

462
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,750
need to do if they are developing a web

463
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,310
application in angular and there is a

464
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:25,070
module that they think they better

465
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:37,870
better doing coke ingo then that's

466
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:37,870
perfectly fine yes yeah 100% yes

467
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,300
it depends a little bit on organizations

468
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,690
organizations that I've worked with

469
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:06,899
never really had what I then call

470
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:09,720
security champions in their team I think

471
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:12,240
it's important to have those people you

472
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,010
can identify them on the go one of the

473
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,960
most beneficial things that I've that

474
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,629
affluent working with with development

475
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,570
teams is to introduce them to threat

476
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,910
modeling and there's a lot of threat

477
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,860
modeling courses where someone comes in

478
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,270
they talk about how to threat model and

479
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,479
then they come with a few mock

480
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:32,129
excercises applications that they've

481
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,110
imagined and do threat modeling that way

482
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:37,290
the way I do treadmill mowing training

483
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,729
is I do the first two hours of training

484
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:42,149
just telling them what threat modeling

485
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,400
is how they can approach it and then I

486
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,040
go into the deep end and they start

487
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,720
explaining the applications and modules

488
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,490
and everything everything that they are

489
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,100
working on and every threat model that

490
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,570
any effect that you see then is that

491
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,629
they immediately start thinking about

492
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,040
their own products and you see different

493
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,070
different people doing different things

494
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:04,230
and they apply it immediately I've I've

495
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,790
done it that a company in Seattle one

496
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:11,700
time not one of the big companies but

497
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:13,560
they we had a lunch break and after the

498
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,360
lunch break they were actually threat

499
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,000
modeling issues that were reported an

500
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,760
hour beforehand and that that's an

501
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,620
amazing thing to see because again those

502
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,410
developers don't come in to develop

503
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,899
insecure code they come in to do good

504
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:31,260
work and if they get the tools to do

505
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,390
that work better and not get a avalanche

506
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,710
of security issues at the end that they

507
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:41,400
have to solve within a limited time

508
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:44,460
frame then you are winning so definitely

509
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,220
the security champions are important one

510
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:50,010
one of the main things also is if you

511
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,960
start with threat modeling or product

512
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:54,210
security training you often get an

513
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,300
audience of the lead architects and the

514
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:59,430
lead developers I always asked for a

515
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,530
mixed audience there is nothing funnier

516
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,820
than sitting in a room where there is a

517
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:05,250
lead architect and there's

518
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,879
someone from QA and the lead architect

519
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:12,019
is explaining how it works and guy from

520
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,669
QA when I uh uh I know how this worse

521
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:16,799
and then you using using that

522
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:18,840
information just looking at the people

523
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,940
it's sometimes very very subtle you have

524
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,740
to there's the guide there's a guy that

525
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,870
is talking but you have to watch the

526
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,610
other people to see how they react to

527
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,729
understand if what he's talking talking

528
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:32,279
about is true so that that's why I said

529
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:34,529
in the beginning as well I probably have

530
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:39,149
a wealth of technical knowledge but I've

531
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:40,679
also built first personal knowledge and

532
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:44,518
knowledge about working with people

533
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:46,919
using those skills in in these product

534
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,480
security or security integration into

535
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,730
your development processes it's not a

536
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,799
it's not a purely technical task it's

537
00:25:50,730 --> 00:26:00,529
it's much broader than that and you have

538
00:25:52,799 --> 00:26:04,980
to understand the organization so I'm

539
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:11,370
down to my last slide now for the key

540
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:13,289
takeaways one of your tasks when working

541
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,580
with development teams is to build the

542
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,500
relationships not only with the

543
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,039
development teams but also towards the

544
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,179
managed management teams at some point

545
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,529
there's going to be pressure on you from

546
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,539
management and you're gonna be the

547
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:26,490
buffer between that development team and

548
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,559
the management team so the development

549
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,350
can can do what they need to do and you

550
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,320
can satisfy the needs of that of that

551
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,719
management team getting that trust is

552
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,779
especially when your external as a

553
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,509
consultant sometimes hard but I usually

554
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:44,940
solve that in the before we sign any any

555
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:46,320
documents I really really need that

556
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,159
freedom and the in the liberty to

557
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,379
interact with it with everybody and to

558
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:55,830
to to make those decisions together with

559
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:57,928
the organization if my power there is

560
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,809
limited then it goes off of the rails

561
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:04,429
after a month two months and you feel

562
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:04,428
that you become more ineffective

563
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,279
understanding the rules

564
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:11,549
understanding how product development

565
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:14,190
works and how product development teams

566
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:16,908
are motivated is critical to your

567
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,909
success as well

568
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:24,658
as a security person your never delete

569
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,470
your supportive your consultative and

570
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:33,179
your there to help people if you're the

571
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:36,690
person that says no then or the person

572
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:40,650
that only says no then you are in

573
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:42,870
trouble and then communication

574
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,480
understanding all your audiences and

575
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,010
community communicating clearly to the

576
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,470
people that you are working for and the

577
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:55,110
people that you're working with is very

578
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:57,780
very important I think I've narrowed it

579
00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:01,080
down to availability those people are

580
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:05,570
very pressured on time and they need

581
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:08,250
answers quickly so I have the benefit of

582
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:10,639
living and working in Belgium I work

583
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:13,140
with with teams around the world so

584
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,059
sometimes I'd jump on calls at 2:00 a.m.

585
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,429
at my own detriment

586
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:19,678
but if that helps my client to make a

587
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:22,200
decision fast then I have one as well so

588
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:30,020
being available and being consultative

589
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:30,020
is also critical to your success yes sir

590
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:40,880
yes I have two more slides but they are

591
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,879
not about the content of the conference

592
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,379
so this is interesting

593
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:45,420
yes I'm sorry but now so first I hate

594
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,490
the term shift left

595
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,290
like I said in somewhere in the middle

596
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,800
of my talk the processes are never

597
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:55,350
linear so there is no left to shift you

598
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:59,639
if you if you look at the I'll go back

599
00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:03,510
to that slides it's here for me it looks

600
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,220
more like a carpet bomb security goes

601
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,890
everywhere in the different processes

602
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,450
but there is no definite shift left it's

603
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,760
a nice marketing team but it doesn't

604
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:15,530
help you're correct in in saying that

605
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:18,510
you want to infect the bloodstream you

606
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:20,820
I've been involved with IC squared for

607
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,530
six years training security

608
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,909
professionals or build building

609
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,160
certifications to train security

610
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,050
professionals I strongly believe that we

611
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,580
don't need more security professionals

612
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,560
we need more professionals that

613
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,330
understand security and one of the roles

614
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:37,230
that we have as security professionals

615
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:39,889
is to help build those mindsets so in

616
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:43,050
that sense yes we're we're trying to

617
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,090
inject that security mindset into the

618
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,950
different roles within within the

619
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:54,570
organization and here within the

620
00:30:46,950 --> 00:31:07,380
development teams yes okay I'll go back

621
00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:10,020
there technology for me that is per

622
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:13,140
organization so the question was if

623
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,860
there are definite if metrics that any

624
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,960
organization could use it depends to me

625
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,120
for me for me depends largely on the

626
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,830
organization itself and that's not to

627
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,979
say that you have to hire me to find out

628
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:28,100
how that works I would love that but

629
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,770
that's not why I'm here

630
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,179
no it also depends on what technologies

631
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,080
they are using there's still a lot of

632
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:40,050
organizations that use Excel dashboards

633
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:43,230
so how you gather information are how

634
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:45,870
you are able to to collect data to

635
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,610
actually derive consistent metrics from

636
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:51,080
it's critical to define which metrics

637
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:55,370
that you use the methodology that I've

638
00:31:51,080 --> 00:32:00,240
applied since I say probably five years

639
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:03,090
is one called gqm and it's a shorthand

640
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,640
for a goal question matrix where you

641
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:09,240
basically understand the the goals of

642
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:12,090
the organization then related to those

643
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,159
goals you ask different questions and

644
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:16,740
then you identify metrics that answer

645
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:20,990
those questions and that for me is a

646
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:23,520
good approach to define your metrics

647
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:25,620
problem and then you choose how to

648
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:29,070
present that whether you use something

649
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:32,250
like well you can use Excel you can use

650
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:35,189
any any dashboarding app you can do that

651
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:37,799
in Jupiter notebooks you can do that in

652
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,260
our whatever works for you to make a

653
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:42,000
presentable metrics framework and most

654
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:51,029
importantly a repeatable metrics

655
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:54,659
framework that's what you should use any

656
00:32:51,029 --> 00:33:03,320
other questions we still have time I

657
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:03,320
think yes Alex

658
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:08,909
these how you integrate that with the

659
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,910
different

660
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:27,970
jamee repeat the question so the

661
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:32,440
approach itself doesn't change at all

662
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:36,130
whether you're looking at a person or a

663
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,210
device or a software the threat modeling

664
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,960
is the same

665
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:42,220
I think the key parts there are that you

666
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,470
when you initiate threat modeling you

667
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,500
don't look at the controls that are

668
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:49,060
there you try to ignore the controls

669
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,860
because you want to add to identify all

670
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,360
the threats even once you think are

671
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,909
mitigated by controls that already

672
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:58,330
exists then you validate those take into

673
00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:01,450
account the controls and whether there

674
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:04,870
is a huge regulatory pressure or there

675
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:06,670
is relatively little that doesn't matter

676
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:09,159
you just have to understand all the

677
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:13,470
frameworks that apply and then integrate

678
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,470
them into your tread modeling process

679
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:23,259
good so I've been in a few talks over

680
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,989
the past few days and everybody did

681
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,350
something personal or reminiscing about

682
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:31,509
derbycon and what is what it has

683
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:36,600
instilled in the security community as

684
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,600
well so I'm going to ask to cut the rig
