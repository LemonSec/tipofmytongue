1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,960
where are you anyway hey there everybody

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:09,719
appreciate y'all coming out to hear us

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,940
talk today this one's gonna be a fun one

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,040
for me because I don't think I've ever

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,470
really talked about a lot of my

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,480
experiences when I worked at Diebold and

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,970
prior to that too with with Scott but

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,039
the people you see here are our mentors

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,198
peers and people that I owe my career to

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,080
in many cases and so I thought it'd be

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,910
good as a good closing derbycon to talk

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,439
a little bit about our experiences and

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,940
what we were able to accomplish and how

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,680
we were successful in what we were doing

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,989
and I think you'll see a common theme

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,940
between all this is that we had a lot of

17
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,309
fun doing it and we built a team that

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,140
had a lot of fun doing it and you know

19
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,309
looked back at those days as some of the

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,170
best days in my life

21
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,629
you know I literally the reason why

22
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,920
derbycon is here today is because Scott

23
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,050
at the time was was the chief security

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,280
officer I was I think it was regional

25
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,930
security officer something at the time

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,460
and I came to Scott with a crazy idea

27
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,809
I'm like hey I'm thinking about starting

28
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,850
this conference in Louisville Kentucky

29
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,870
you think that's okay he's like yeah I

30
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,520
just don't tell it's corporate

31
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,229
communications and you it'll be fine and

32
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,689
it's like okay I'll go start it up and

33
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,740
and so you'll kind of see navigate

34
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,169
through some of the stories that we've

35
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,030
been through but this is Jeff's walpole

36
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,229
Kevin Baker and Scott Angelo but I

37
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,909
figured they'd do a brief introduction

38
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,189
themselves but these folks were

39
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,479
instrumental in my career and kind of

40
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,250
kicking off and some of the funny

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,750
stories that we had but also what we

42
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,640
were able to do and how we were able to

43
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,590
do it I think can paint a really good

44
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,330
picture around how people can be

45
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,009
successful in their own careers and how

46
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,658
you can leverage things that we've

47
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,579
learned and the hardships that we've

48
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,479
gone through to really improve what

49
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,130
you're doing here and what's what's

50
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,079
going on with information security so

51
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,798
with that I'll kick it over to Jess hi

52
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:43,740
Jess yeah Jess hopeful from ice I guess

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,720
I'm at Lincoln Electric so I serve as

54
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,560
the vice president of global IT security

55
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,759
and infrastructure operations you know

56
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,939
I've had the pleasure of knowing these

57
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,490
guys for the last 14 years and it's been

58
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,139
a great journey so I appreciate the fact

59
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:03,329
that Dave had asked us to come and do

60
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:06,180
this too with him so jess was the person

61
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,559
know I did this is a good start just was

62
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,539
the person that you always wanted to

63
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,730
have in your back pocket for when

64
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,690
something went wrong a quick example of

65
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,349
this really quick and it's one my

66
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,700
favorite stories of Deebo

67
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,709
is that one of their main web

68
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,690
applications at the time was Cirrus and

69
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:22,540
it had a lot of managed services for our

70
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,250
customers and and at the time I found a

71
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,798
blind sequel injection flaw in it and I

72
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,230
accidentally did a loop which erased

73
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:32,349
everybody's passwords and our entire in

74
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,640
the entire database and I don't have

75
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,170
been working there for maybe a month or

76
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,940
so and I get a call from the main

77
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,200
developer as serious and like hey are

78
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,489
you working on something with Cirrus

79
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,810
right now because all of our customers

80
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:42,010
are out in our entites and it's like

81
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,930
literally an outage of our entire

82
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:48,010
company I'm like maybe and you know the

83
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,329
first thing I did is I picked up the

84
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,410
phone and I called Jess I'm like Jess I

85
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:52,209
really messed up and here's what

86
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,769
happened and I locked everybody out and

87
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,819
she's like okay well that exposure

88
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,900
should be their first place let's go

89
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:57,160
figure out how we can get it fixed and

90
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,290
you know that was kind of the mentality

91
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,840
of working with people and having her

92
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,190
working with me and being able to dig me

93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,750
out of a lot of troublesome issues that

94
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:11,650
I had was I was amazing so I'm Kevin

95
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,750
Baker and I'm kind of concluding a

96
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:17,950
careers to see so it westphall insurance

97
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,019
and I'm retiring but not really and I'm

98
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:24,668
gonna go and direct something called

99
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:27,849
insurer shield which is a hybrid I Sal

100
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:32,319
for insurance agents so I'm going from

101
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:36,418
the clue fool to the clueless and try

102
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:41,500
and accomplish the same things hi I'm

103
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:45,459
Scott Angelo and at one point or another

104
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:48,870
I hired all three these or pulled them

105
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:53,310
out of roles that they were kind of

106
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:56,379
buried in and gave them opportunities so

107
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,239
I'm the one that can tell you how to go

108
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:04,780
from I started out as a Intel officer

109
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,930
went into Industrial Security and worked

110
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,819
the first half of my career as a

111
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,519
security expert and or experts a

112
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:16,060
relative term I was never an expert but

113
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,190
I became a CIO and those are some of the

114
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,539
things that I want to share because I

115
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:25,630
believe that security practitioners make

116
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:27,580
that's the best route to becoming a CIO

117
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:31,990
so we can talk about

118
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:34,300
that too so I'll kick it off with my

119
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,949
very first interaction with Scot Angela

120
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,780
here which I think would be a good one

121
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:39,789
Scot hired me is a really really

122
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,469
interesting one this is a long time ago

123
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:44,229
by the way so older dave is much more

124
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:49,300
mature than younger dave was at the time

125
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:51,909
okay have it last week but Scot hired me

126
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,669
out of the military to join a company

127
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:56,409
cut the time called secure state and it

128
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,030
was a small consulting shop at the time

129
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,409
I think me and when I joined I was maybe

130
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,169
five or six employees or something like

131
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:04,270
that it was relatively small and what

132
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,099
excited me about them was it got me

133
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,719
early on and penetration testing and I

134
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:09,340
didn't have a lot of communication

135
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:11,560
skills I didn't like going in front of

136
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,150
people I just liked the technical focus

137
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,710
and actually you know coding and

138
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,030
figuring things out that's where I

139
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,068
learned a lot from Scott and on hey

140
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,448
there's more to just life than just

141
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,469
getting air and breaking stuff which I

142
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,940
still like to break stuff but that's

143
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,990
like talking about breaking stuff which

144
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,330
is cool

145
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,219
and so one day and I don't know why this

146
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,889
happened but there was two owners at the

147
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:31,449
time and and kennen Scott and Ken was

148
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,069
like hey you should go mess with Scott

149
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,300
and we start talking about what we're

150
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,740
gonna do to mess with Scott and I'm like

151
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,409
whoa I'll just go into his office in my

152
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,680
boxers which I thought be fine I've been

153
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:43,629
working there for like two weeks and so

154
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,190
Scott's on the phone and he's on an

155
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:48,430
important phone call and I just I sit

156
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,479
down and I'm in my boxers and you know

157
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,800
he doesn't know I'm there he's got his

158
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,440
like feet kind of kicked up in the back

159
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,639
and everything and he turns around and

160
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,469
make like a little noise he turns around

161
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,469
and he and he's on the phone he's like I

162
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,370
mean you know and it's one of those

163
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,589
things where I was like oh I messed up

164
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:13,620
and Scott wouldn't talk to me for two

165
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:13,620
weeks

166
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,599
so I was really sweating I'm like am I

167
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,710
gonna lose my job you know that was

168
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,670
pretty you know in the Marines that was

169
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,989
normal like he could walk into

170
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,060
somebody's office and boxers any time

171
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,590
and it'd be perfectly fine but you know

172
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,790
civilian life a little bit different I

173
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,280
had literally just got on the Marine

174
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:32,060
Corps and and so Scott comes to me like

175
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,320
two weeks later and he's like hey sir

176
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,419
I've been ignoring you for two weeks but

177
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,400
I've been trying to understand what I've

178
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:40,729
ever said to you that wanted to make you

179
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,750
come to my office in your boxers and

180
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,550
he's like I want to ensure that that

181
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,900
never happens again I was like listen

182
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,160
man we're on the same page I'm not ever

183
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,960
gonna show him your boxers ever again I

184
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,900
think I did a couple years later but but

185
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,870
aside from that I never happened again

186
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,630
so you know but but the reason I want to

187
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,880
tell that story is that it was a lot of

188
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,710
fun where I worked at right and it was a

189
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,360
lot of fun when I left security to go to

190
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,760
deboned and even though I was working

191
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,890
for a fortune 1000 company I had so much

192
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,000
to learn from people around me and the

193
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,469
most important thing that I can relate

194
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,729
to is that you know I didn't know

195
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,260
everything I didn't know how to

196
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:20,180
communicate or navigate the ropes of

197
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:21,650
Debose political system or you know the

198
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,780
architecture and infrastructure of how

199
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,190
it was designed or how to talk to

200
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,340
executives or even be able to to

201
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,080
interface them in any way and I learn I

202
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,669
basically was a sponge for everybody

203
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,020
from everybody around me to learn

204
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:34,430
everything that I possibly could and

205
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,020
I'll talk a little bit more about the

206
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,940
the program but I think that's a good

207
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,200
starting point of just how we all

208
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,770
leverage each other to kind of build a

209
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,510
program yeah you know it has been a

210
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,640
journey it was it was exciting I know

211
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:50,930
when when Scott joined Diebold in 2006

212
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,150
you know I can remember the very first

213
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,750
seeing at time I saw his email and what

214
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,799
we he was his demands word I thought oh

215
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,190
god what have we gotten herself into

216
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,419
with this one but it was it's been a

217
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,219
really interesting journey and at the

218
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:06,620
time I was just doing finance and I

219
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,770
wondered why would I ever get into

220
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,030
security but it was really a situation

221
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,159
that that was back in the days when

222
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,719
sarbanes-oxley had been big and you know

223
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,919
I didn't really know too much about that

224
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,530
but I had been involved with it

225
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,030
obviously and for some reason he thought

226
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,369
that I was the right fit and he had

227
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:25,820
already pulled Kevin into the mix and we

228
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,080
had another person in the team but going

229
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,379
from an organization

230
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,978
where it was literally the start for the

231
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:36,500
security program and then quickly over

232
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:39,519
36 months bringing in 30 different

233
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,779
individuals into the IT security arena

234
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,820
and getting the opportunity and I only

235
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,279
do IT security but also product security

236
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,980
and OPSEC and learning how to navigate

237
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:52,570
budget aspects and to your point

238
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:55,279
political I think it was it was a great

239
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:57,470
it was a great in Denver and I know I

240
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,990
look back on that time and you know I do

241
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,620
it again in a minute and I also wonder

242
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,579
why I would do it again in a minute

243
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,220
because there are a lot of long nights

244
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:14,390
and a lot of challenging aspects

245
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:17,180
associated with it yeah I I think what

246
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:20,360
we would really like to be able to give

247
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:24,290
you today is you know just a taste of

248
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:27,290
our experience because the time in which

249
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,930
we lived in and the state the state of

250
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:33,829
the industry at the time that we began

251
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:38,029
for me it was like 2003 and 2004 you

252
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:42,500
know it was we were there for you know

253
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:45,890
the first internet banking sites the

254
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:50,630
first ATM jackpots the first exploits

255
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,550
that truly we would have assumed that a

256
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,740
company as large as what we worked with

257
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:59,540
would have had a whole lot more than

258
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:04,579
what they had and my experience there

259
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:06,500
was that I was working in the fledgling

260
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:08,029
security department that wasn't called a

261
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,680
security department you know what that

262
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:14,720
means the guys that work over there in

263
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:18,469
the dark right and it was killing me I

264
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,730
mean I felt like I was fighting whipping

265
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:25,790
the tide to keep it from coming in no

266
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,040
hope that there would ever be any level

267
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,719
of success you know and if you you know

268
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,079
maybe you've tasted a little bit of that

269
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,300
but they you know they brought and Scott

270
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,029
Angelo for some strange reason I don't

271
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,390
know how that happened but when he came

272
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:40,390
in

273
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:47,229
he began to articulate a a version of

274
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:50,649
doing information security which

275
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,420
suddenly seemed doable to me whereas I

276
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,850
felt like I was drowning we're never

277
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,540
gonna make any progress here someone

278
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:01,779
came in with some actually very simple

279
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,988
concepts and a way to articulate them

280
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:06,730
that I thought yeah I'm not gonna bail

281
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:08,619
cuz I had been a heavy equipment

282
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,819
operator and I was really thinking about

283
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:14,739
going back you know but when I heard

284
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:16,868
Scott and the way he began to talk about

285
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:18,069
information security I thought okay that

286
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:21,189
makes sense

287
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:24,959
I think this is doable so that was kind

288
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:28,540
of the beginning of my journey in in

289
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,819
really taking on the the the desire to

290
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,589
be an information security professional

291
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:38,860
and then of course he said you got a

292
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:41,860
year to get your cissp all right those

293
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:45,759
are really good stories and I actually

294
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:50,319
did consider stripping down to my boxers

295
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:52,410
during this presentation but figured I

296
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:56,738
probably get fired from my current job

297
00:11:52,410 --> 00:12:00,129
because someone would post it but you

298
00:11:56,739 --> 00:12:02,230
know I've been in this business for over

299
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:06,939
thirty years I know I don't look at a

300
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:09,809
much younger than but anyways I've been

301
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:12,339
very very fortunate you know early on

302
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:14,709
and I think these are all key things

303
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:20,589
right that I'm about to say early on I

304
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:24,219
was unbelievably blessed with having two

305
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:28,929
incredible mentors that taught me a lot

306
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,660
about security and didn't have

307
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:34,179
necessarily anything to do with

308
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:37,689
technical Security's about protection

309
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:42,970
protecting things and they talked to me

310
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:47,379
about also if you really want to provide

311
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:50,769
value to your organization you will

312
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:54,040
learn the business of that organization

313
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:58,180
because if you don't you

314
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:01,630
always be suboptimal to some degree and

315
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:04,269
unless you learn the business you're

316
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:07,660
never going to be able to speak the

317
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:10,149
language you know because technical

318
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,579
folks whether you're security you know

319
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:15,819
it doesn't matter engineer analyst

320
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:19,149
developer you you do speak a different

321
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:21,579
language than the people that are

322
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:24,100
running the business and it's not their

323
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:26,380
job to learn your language it's it's

324
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,120
your job to learn theirs and that's not

325
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,100
for everyone so I think that's the first

326
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,350
thing you got and I've taught that to

327
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,800
every one of these individuals at one

328
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:38,440
point if you don't that's okay you don't

329
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,139
have to learn their language and you can

330
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,800
be good at what you do but you will be

331
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:46,540
limited and that's okay because we need

332
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,189
people that just want to be engineers or

333
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,139
analysts or developers and things and

334
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,279
you can be the best and you always

335
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:54,160
should and that's another thing that I

336
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,290
always looked for and I was I would say

337
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,410
I was very fortunate and there was a lot

338
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:03,730
of luck in and just seeing someone they

339
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:05,560
weren't necessarily doing security and I

340
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,380
pick them out of that and I put them in

341
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:11,050
a role and I challenged them to be the

342
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,209
best that they could write so I learned

343
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,899
that early because once you learn the

344
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:20,138
business now you can play in the gray

345
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:22,029
area and there's not a whole lot of

346
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:24,550
there's not optimal value and just

347
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,649
working in black and white it's really

348
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,349
getting into the gray area coming up

349
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:31,959
with compensating and mitigating type of

350
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,639
solutions that will help the business do

351
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,790
what they want to do and you only do

352
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,610
that by really learning the business and

353
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,760
in essence learning the language of the

354
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:46,709
business so over thirty years I've been

355
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:51,009
fortunate to build five very large

356
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:55,149
programs in five about four different

357
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:58,839
industries the first program I built was

358
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:01,449
it NASA's Special Projects totally

359
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,040
different and you know that's when I had

360
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:04,260
to put all these things together oh and

361
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,199
how am I gonna learn this business

362
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:10,740
because the area that I was in will

363
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,690
they basically were rocket engineers and

364
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,670
I'm like I gotta try to figure out that

365
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,670
at least I understand as much as I can

366
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:22,069
successful program then I went on to

367
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:25,350
DARPA and built their very first

368
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:28,200
information security program use the

369
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:31,410
same principles left and went into

370
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,120
consulting because I wanted to get into

371
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,219
the commercial and I wanted to test out

372
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,110
some theories I wanted to make sure that

373
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,210
the things that I had learned in the

374
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,820
military and in the government would be

375
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:44,190
applicable I thought they were and then

376
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,070
I came in - I'm not gonna bore you but

377
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,720
that's when I went to Diebold and

378
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:52,550
Diebold is where I made the transition I

379
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:58,710
was hired in as their very first CIS Oh

380
00:15:52,550 --> 00:16:01,859
par me and then I became the CSO and

381
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:04,050
then I got to the the whole thing about

382
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,030
getting to the board and we always

383
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:11,130
talked about getting to the table

384
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:15,120
getting to the table is hard staying at

385
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,230
the table is even more difficult and I

386
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,880
stayed at the table

387
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:22,920
and they made me the CIO and and and I

388
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,920
said I've always I've never been a more

389
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:30,500
effective security practitioner than I

390
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,990
am as a CIO because now I can enforce

391
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,190
that across across the board so I don't

392
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,990
want to belabor that but then I went

393
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,210
into different industries the other key

394
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,730
thing that I want you know learning the

395
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:45,000
business right the second thing is there

396
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:48,680
is no such thing as one-size-fits-all

397
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,470
and because each business is different

398
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:53,760
you have to understand the business

399
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,950
economics and that means they're

400
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,200
financed right because understand the

401
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,830
money how that money how that

402
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,750
organization generates money you have to

403
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,550
understand the industry because every

404
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,680
industry is different you have to

405
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,050
understand the organizational setup and

406
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:13,050
there's a difference between a regional

407
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,688
organization then there is a global

408
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,819
organization so there are a lot of

409
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:20,730
different components and and again just

410
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,859
that's all about learning the language

411
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,720
and the last thing I'll say before I we

412
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:28,169
go back and obvious you know get back

413
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:32,340
into this is I often hear

414
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:34,110
well they say no and one of the things I

415
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,300
think everyone always says to me when I

416
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,540
come into a new organization of about

417
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:41,940
the six months more point how did you

418
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:45,030
get them to agree to these things that

419
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,420
none of your predecessors were able to

420
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:51,330
and the first thing was it was learning

421
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:55,080
their language and not giving them the

422
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,820
ability to say no because no is an

423
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,879
option and you have to understand that

424
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,740
right no is an option but if I'm telling

425
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,230
to describe an option to you and I'm

426
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,080
speaking different language I gave that

427
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,990
executive an opportunity to say no

428
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,030
because he had no idea what I was

429
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,580
talking about so that's the last thing

430
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,889
I'm going to say about understand and

431
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,949
learn the business just as much as your

432
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:23,610
your perfecting and honing your very

433
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:26,400
specific technical skill take the time

434
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,399
to understand what a piano is a balance

435
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,300
sheet and I'm telling you that will

436
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,400
advance your opportunities inside of any

437
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,030
organization and you'll find that that

438
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:44,840
will allow you to go into other

439
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:47,760
industries and and have the same success

440
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,459
due to you totally remember him saying

441
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,770
we were not allowed to say no yeah that

442
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:59,880
was I learned a lot of creative ways of

443
00:18:52,770 --> 00:19:01,980
saying yes one thing I'll say about

444
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,560
Scott and he's very humble and talking

445
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,360
about this but I literally oh where my

446
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,710
career is today to Scott's like Scott

447
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,149
literally taught and mentored me and

448
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,400
that's a sign of a good leader where

449
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,650
he'll take the time to teach you to

450
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,700
train you to know when you have talent

451
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,350
or not and when I came out of the

452
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,660
military I was just a kid out of the

453
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,760
military that no one knew Dave Kennedy

454
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,680
there was no derbycon there's no social

455
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,970
engineer toolkit there was no PowerShell

456
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,890
at the time none of that stuff had

457
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,500
happened yet and really when my career

458
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:31,110
really started taking off was 100% under

459
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,120
Scott and if you look at my PowerShell

460
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,689
research that Jason

461
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,949
Josh Kelly

462
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,450
presented at DEFCON even David

463
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,580
assignment we did the SCCM hacking with

464
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:43,730
DEFCON we started der beek on all that

465
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,340
stuff happened when Scott enabled me as

466
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,690
a person to go and do it and you know at

467
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,189
the same time I'm learning the way to

468
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,870
communicate to people I eventually

469
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:52,910
became the chief security officer and

470
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,080
took Scott's spot over at D Bolden and

471
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,190
ran their security program chief

472
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,179
information security officer was out to

473
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,400
security I don't remember I was one of

474
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,750
them but ran their program for a while

475
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,760
until I decided to start trust at SAC

476
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,080
and one thing I can say is that you know

477
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,730
what we were able to accomplish during

478
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,550
those those periods of time as a team is

479
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,600
a testament to that leadership and one

480
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,879
of the things that I just want to give

481
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,490
you an example of is that I remember

482
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,930
walking in one day and Scott was going

483
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,620
to present to the board and it was my

484
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,610
first time presenting at the board and

485
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,139
and I'll tell another about the board

486
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,090
here in just a second you you a holes

487
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,740
that cover my car up but anyways other

488
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,000
than that the one time I went to go

489
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,350
present to the board you know I said

490
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,780
Scott what do you want me to present on

491
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:32,209
he's like I just want you to be you

492
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,220
there I want them to know that I have

493
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,870
somebody like you there so that they

494
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,640
trust everything that I'm doing when I

495
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,050
go up there I talk to him I know if you

496
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,220
remember that or not but I went up then

497
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,450
I was like I was talking a bunch of

498
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,290
stuff they had no idea what I was

499
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,490
talking about is like we're getting

500
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,350
thrust from here and I made a joke about

501
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,200
Canada because we had a Ark site at the

502
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,639
time and and so there you can see like

503
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,600
this little pew pew map right and you'd

504
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,550
see like where the attacks are coming

505
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,260
from and during the NHL hockey

506
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,870
timeframes we had zero attacks

507
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,190
originated from from from Canada and so

508
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,719
I remember that one was pretty good I

509
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,340
always used that joke for a while and

510
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,870
and the executives loved and they like

511
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,909
man it's awesome you had you know these

512
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,739
types of folks in your team and so Scott

513
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,180
was able to leverage you know people and

514
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,320
his team and trust people and his team

515
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,570
to go and do things he knew when I was

516
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,550
doing something I remember one time and

517
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,990
just by the way was was was phenomenal

518
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,100
for for shielding me for a lot of the

519
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,100
stuff that I did but remember one time

520
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,870
we were implementing scan safe and their

521
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,980
scan safe was taking a long time to pull

522
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,360
a lot longer than I wanted to was like

523
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,500
it was like we're like a month into it

524
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,030
which I know for a fortune 1000

525
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,890
companies not long but I was really

526
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,720
impatient and I wanted to be the first

527
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:32,300
company really that I knew of to block

528
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,490
all egress ports period including 18 4 4

529
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,520
3 across our entire perimeter everywhere

530
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,530
right in a month right and so you know

531
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,200
sounds doable right Fortune 1000 company

532
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,690
across the globe will do it right so we

533
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,060
had all the ports done except 80 and 443

534
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,440
and at the time there are these they're

535
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,600
called scan safe

536
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,860
beacon servers and the beacon servers

537
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,360
would be deployed in your network and

538
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,830
then what would happen is your machines

539
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,479
were then communicates beacon servers

540
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,860
and then go out to the internet over

541
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,170
what a report you wanted to so be like a

542
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:04,729
web proxy but then you could block 18 4

543
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:07,010
4 3 and so I go up to 2 at the time it

544
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,450
was mark Couric and I'm like all right I

545
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:09,770
went through Scott Shaffer the time I

546
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,690
went with Scott I was there and I went

547
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:13,700
to Scott Shafer I'm like hey man can you

548
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,550
find an RFC that kind of sounds like

549
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,410
this and he's like an RFC s sounds like

550
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,490
blocking 18 443 across the entire

551
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,650
companies like that's gonna break the

552
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,970
shit out of everything I'm like yeah but

553
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,490
it won't be that bad right I mean it's

554
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,070
not gonna be like I can just fun like an

555
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,930
RC and tuck in there and if you know if

556
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,100
if you get in trouble I'll just take the

557
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,060
blame for and I'll take the I'll take

558
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,280
all the heat right I was like I just

559
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,690
made you do it and he's like nah man as

560
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,110
too risky for me sorry so then I went to

561
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:40,040
mark who's my good friend in a telecom

562
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,600
and something like hey Mark

563
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,340
I'm like hey can you find that same

564
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,870
speech like can you find ours he's like

565
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,790
man that's gonna break everything and

566
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,899
I'm like it's not gonna be that BAE's I

567
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,730
go it's gonna be bad I'm like we'll just

568
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,200
figure it out so I went to I went to

569
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,580
Jason with this guy like hey I'm about

570
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,960
to do this thing really quick and it's

571
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,730
probably gonna break most of the company

572
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,500
but we're gonna be way better off when

573
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,390
we do it and I don't think it means that

574
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,950
bad and so they're like all right go for

575
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,900
it and so we found in RFC we tucked

576
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,120
underneath there and we got it done and

577
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,070
it broke our entire production line for

578
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,629
our ATMs at the time but it's only for

579
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,360
like an hour so wasn't that big of a

580
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,160
deal and so no one was actually really

581
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,629
upset and we actually got it all in pill

582
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,370
met and we had no egress ports going out

583
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,720
our entire company that was that was

584
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,760
like some of the fun and relationships

585
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,650
but though the working relation suit the

586
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,030
work English if we had with IT was

587
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,620
absolutely phenomenal like I mean the

588
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,510
folks would go and passions we needed to

589
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,860
and I buy them beer and pizza all the

590
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,150
time for all the things that I would ask

591
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,770
him to do like man that's not gonna go

592
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,170
good I'm like it'll be fine

593
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,520
but it worked out it worked out really

594
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:36,140
well we were able to implement a lot of

595
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,600
change really quick and the difference

596
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,070
was at the end of the day I knew I had a

597
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,449
leadership team that would back me for

598
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,980
what I was doing and at the end of the

599
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,110
day I knew that he had the full support

600
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,430
of our CEO at the time Tom Swift our ski

601
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,840
and Tom's like do whatever you need to

602
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,320
do to secure a company and I don't care

603
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,020
what it takes

604
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,760
and and that comes from leadership from

605
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,470
a team that you know you can trust and

606
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,000
to be able to pull things off like that

607
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,590
and not get fired because you're

608
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,660
destroying an entire company overnight

609
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,429
by accident it was an accident

610
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,240
you know I was changing sequel essay

611
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,310
password

612
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,510
you know when they'd have found like a

613
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,710
weak Seagal password and product like

614
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,480
that's getting changed right now

615
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,530
we'll change that put up in a tic if

616
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,940
anybody complains about it we'll figure

617
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,710
it out you know as one of those types of

618
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,510
deals and we knock through a lot of

619
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,980
legacy stuff very quickly a mainframe

620
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,140
same thing knocked him out quickly

621
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,460
overall environment architecture design

622
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,290
knocked out really quick he started find

623
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,910
different areas centralizing our our

624
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,440
infrastructure from being globally kind

625
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:26,420
of dispatched in multiple locations to

626
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,220
one location I mean we did it all so

627
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,190
fast I mean it was it was a span of what

628
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,990
how many years two years three years two

629
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,790
years two years we did all of that and

630
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,530
it was incredible good Jordanna if

631
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,570
anything it's add to it but all the

632
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,730
trouble I got you in but I'm just gonna

633
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:48,110
say for my team that's here we're not

634
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:50,390
doing this yeah I mean I don't remember

635
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,679
a lot of that but I do remember there

636
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,270
was a lot of different changes and maybe

637
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,580
it was also because the fact that you

638
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,610
know as amongst this going on we also

639
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,230
had it was very interesting because I

640
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,080
think when Scott came on board and we

641
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,520
were first looking at our program it was

642
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,870
really focused on enterprise security

643
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,129
which we thought that was kind of cool

644
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,300
all right so we're going to get to

645
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:12,050
enterprise security for this

646
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:14,270
organization but the interesting part

647
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:17,899
was that quickly switched to product

648
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:21,440
security in solution security and OPSEC

649
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:24,280
security and I think we all had to learn

650
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,270
quickly how to continue to morph and

651
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,889
this probably drives my team crazy

652
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:32,930
because it's constantly that morphing

653
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:34,610
aspect so thank you Scott but I think it

654
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,710
was a matter that we just learned how to

655
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,729
adapt quickly to what was going on in

656
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,750
the environment what was important to

657
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:43,580
the business and in doing such we were

658
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,840
able to change a program from being

659
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,580
focused on just enterprise security

660
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,919
whether it was for compliance and

661
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,870
regulatory aspects and the things that

662
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,660
you just need to do to be a publicly

663
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,459
owned company to something that actually

664
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,310
was a market differentiator for our

665
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:00,890
organization it was exciting to be able

666
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:03,649
to start working on solutions where we

667
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:05,480
had to do things around you know NIST

668
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,300
compliance for government contracts we

669
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,930
had to support FFIEC we all know how the

670
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,610
financial industry is looking at those

671
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,770
components building out the right types

672
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,419
of programs and amongst that you know

673
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,580
having the security concerns that you

674
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:23,000
would have over not just the enterprise

675
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,800
but also over the product set I'm not

676
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,100
going to steal a thunder about our ATM

677
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,600
so what you do that one but I think it's

678
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,860
interesting to go through that process

679
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,629
and then at the end of at least my

680
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,429
career I think the most exciting part

681
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,460
and I know you know you were a key part

682
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,960
of it and what Dave was able to build

683
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:44,780
from the security standpoint to have

684
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,870
their level of reliance on it was to to

685
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:51,680
be able to help in the selling process

686
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:55,120
associated with those products the the

687
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,470
thing to add to that is that we became a

688
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,379
reliance on the company to sell their

689
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:02,420
products and so security became a driver

690
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,400
across our entire organization where we

691
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,500
were a huge differentiator in the ATM

692
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,270
space and we won some of our largest

693
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,610
deals and Diebold history because of our

694
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,450
security program and when you can do

695
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,120
something like that

696
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,010
everybody listens to security and and

697
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,350
listens in a positive way you're not the

698
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,030
folks that are savvy and we were we were

699
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,350
really cool with everybody I mean like

700
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,180
we work with our software development

701
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,620
folks who wouldn't just shut things down

702
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,540
he wouldn't you know be that kind of

703
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,919
draconian type of mentality we were very

704
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,240
much open with our teams and we were

705
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,520
known as the fun group like we had nerf

706
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,930
guns and you know we wear jeans were not

707
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,980
supposed to and you know do all these

708
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,240
things that you know you're trying to

709
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,240
change kind of a culture for one I

710
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,870
remember one time one of the EVPs what

711
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,480
was his name the EP over operations

712
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:46,760
really big really big guy George mace

713
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,900
George major is coming by and George

714
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,540
majors combine we're having a nerf gun

715
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,160
war and accidentally shot George Mays we

716
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,639
was an executive vice president and the

717
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,830
sight of his shoulder and he's a really

718
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,260
big guy like him his hands are like four

719
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,429
times the size of mine and he's in he

720
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,060
says Davy if you shoot me again I'm

721
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,060
gonna crush your skull

722
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,970
like fair enough George is cool you know

723
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:09,469
and and you know it was it was a really

724
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,120
fun environment but the thing about it

725
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,490
is is security was really well received

726
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,959
throughout the entire business and I

727
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:17,899
think it's important to understand that

728
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,490
the period of time that we're in and

729
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:22,219
when all these things were happening we

730
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,860
also like met some really interesting

731
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,529
people from the Secret Service you know

732
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,500
the things went wrong you know things

733
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:34,039
that were easy to get away with from a

734
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:37,669
security perspective and in the 90s in

735
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:39,649
the arts not so much you know Diebold

736
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:42,350
used to sell transaction processing

737
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:44,149
software so they sold this software with

738
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,010
the assumption in the shared

739
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:47,959
responsibility model as they call it

740
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,970
today that the people that they sold

741
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,720
this to the community banks the small

742
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,789
banks they would say you know oK we've

743
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,190
set this thing up you can drive your

744
00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:00,080
ATMs with it and here's your encryption

745
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,840
keys and they would like put it in a

746
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,549
folder the SES the the systems engineers

747
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,970
would put it in a folder on on the

748
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:10,870
customers environment in the name of the

749
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:13,580
folder was here's your encryption keys

750
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:16,189
right so as long as there was no

751
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,139
connection to the outside world you

752
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,390
could get away with things like that it

753
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:23,750
was it was security by him security but

754
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:26,630
but once these small community banks

755
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:28,880
started having internet banking sites

756
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:32,120
and internet presence people started

757
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,360
hacking them in and finding all the

758
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,360
thing

759
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:44,169
things that perhaps we had not done

760
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:48,129
right so incidents began to happen bad

761
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:51,840
incidents and you know we learned a lot

762
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:54,960
the hard way we we had foreign

763
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,040
datacenters you know I ended up being

764
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,260
Security Manager for Global Services

765
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,540
over there like 13 places in the world

766
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:04,660
where we had data centers that provided

767
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,340
managed services to ATM networks and so

768
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,790
would have to go to all these places but

769
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:12,220
the first place I went was China and it

770
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:15,490
was in our incident response one of our

771
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:18,190
websites had been defaced by a group of

772
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,350
hackers that said basically if I

773
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:24,309
remember right you need to patch your

774
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:26,290
website right so when so Scott

775
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:28,210
introduced me and I think I've met him a

776
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,950
couple times before this young man who

777
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,470
was gonna go with me and he was gonna be

778
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:35,410
the guy who who did the technical stuff

779
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,330
and which was David and we went to China

780
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,490
you know and I grew up believing like if

781
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,500
you went to China you know they might

782
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,179
take you on the street and shoot you you

783
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,610
know I mean it was a very strange thing

784
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:48,330
for me to be in a communist country it's

785
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:52,030
not the same as it is today you know in

786
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:54,939
2006 and 7 it was very different so so

787
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:57,460
David and I took a trip and found out

788
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:00,549
that there was another hacker underneath

789
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,290
those hackers and he was like a hair's

790
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:04,480
breadth away from the mainframe at the

791
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:07,659
Home Office and we had to respond to

792
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:12,970
that incident so we go there and they

793
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:16,720
lose our luggage yeah yeah so so we

794
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:20,169
check into the hotel and there's a for a

795
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,940
car that French like target behind the

796
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:26,500
hotel and we go in there we got a pie

797
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:29,350
you know t-shirts and underwear and two

798
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,679
toothbrushes and we go in nobody speaks

799
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,330
English there right and so you go in you

800
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:38,230
make the international sign for

801
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:41,620
toothbrush right and and and oh yeah and

802
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:43,299
and these they were leading us around

803
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:47,280
the store and we were getting stuff so

804
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:50,408
I'm going back in this aisle and this

805
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,539
little girl woman looked like a little

806
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,309
girl to me

807
00:31:52,539 --> 00:32:00,759
she's pointing up to something I look at

808
00:31:54,309 --> 00:32:03,009
this product and it's for hair loss so I

809
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:06,940
go Dave Dave you totally got to come

810
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:09,609

811
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:13,869
so we do that we get the toothbrush we

812
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:14,739
go to buy underwear well you know let me

an extra-large pair of underwear in

815
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:26,589
China is like a small pair of underwear

816
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:30,159
here so we talk kind of like this for a

817
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:32,349
couple of days yeah real quick on that

818
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,599
he's not exaggerating I was Big Dave

819
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:37,089
then so I was 300-pound Dave and I had

820
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:41,379
to cut the sides of the the underwear

821
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:42,609
out just so my legs can hand him it

822
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:44,218
might have been a fashion way I started

823
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:46,779
a fashion statement of tighty-whitey

824
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:51,309
things that had a cut in the side so it

825
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:53,379
was bad so I I guess you know I wanted

826
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:56,139
to tell those little lighter stories to

827
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:58,869
let you know that you know relationship

828
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:59,529
is more important to you than you may

829
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:02,708
realize

830
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:05,199
I work with college students all the

831
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:08,409
time in universities all the time trying

832
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:12,039
to get them to to move people into a

833
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:14,979
sane education that gets them value for

834
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:16,809
their education value for your education

835
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:19,479
see people come out of college they say

836
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:21,279
you need to be bring value to my company

837
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:22,749
but you know really we got to bring

838
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:28,029
value to these people for their

839
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:30,129
education and and that means they're

840
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:32,590
you're supposed to drink that yeah

841
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:35,168
you're supposed to drink that

842
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:37,509
that that the vet like look at these

843
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:41,200
relationships we we haven't worked at

844
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:45,759
the same company in in years and yet we

845
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,610
are we are resources for one another

846
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,769
Jess and David and Scott have helped me

847
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:53,769
with the company where I'm at right now

848
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:57,070
and help me to make me successful you

849
00:33:53,769 --> 00:34:01,240
know its grow it's real yeah that's the

850
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:12,599
stuff that's it's warm they warmed it up

851
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:15,879
for you so while you're doing that

852
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,700
remember remember that what you have to

853
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:22,149
bring to the company you work for is

854
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:24,339
more than the technical pieces that you

855
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:26,290
have those are really important things

856
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:28,179
but if you can't communicate them to

857
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:31,089
other people and there's there must be a

858
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:33,940
hundred careers inside information

859
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:37,779
security it doesn't matter what you do

860
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:40,450
but you can fit in but let me tell you

861
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,099
this what you're doing now is not what

862
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:45,638
you're going to be doing in five years

863
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:47,230
so don't build your life like what

864
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,329
you're doing right now is what you're

865
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:52,030
always going to be doing you'll be lucky

866
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:56,800
if it lasts three years and then you're

867
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:58,480
going to be doing something else so I

868
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,829
think what's interesting and this is I'm

869
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,780
starting to realize that you guys had a

870
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:08,700
lot of fun breaking stuff and I feel

871
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:11,079
like I had to do a lot of explaining and

872
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,359
marketing no we're not tilt we're not

873
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,310
selling the markets right no so and with

874
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,520
that I mean I think what's interesting

875
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:20,650
is is that I still use a phrase from you

876
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,319
that I know my team haze which is the

877
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:27,580
fantastic chicken or the pig coming the

878
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:31,060
table full story

879
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,680
and there were aspects of you that I had

880
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,170
to go through and explain to regulators

881
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,029
as to why I trusted him because they

882
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:42,370
were afraid that he would go rogue any

883
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:44,520
day real real funny story that so we're

884
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:47,799
going through an FFIEC examination and

885
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,780
one of the guys there was was talking

886
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,490
about you know some of our examinations

887
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,590
and stuff like that and I'm like listen

888
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,879
this is all fun but I really am doing

889
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,990
and I have an unreleased version of the

890
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,790
social engineer toolkit do you want to

891
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:59,080
see that and he's like yeah I would like

892
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,490
to see that so I just did a demo a set

893
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,750
while I'm like literally talking this FF

894
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,069
IC regulator and he's like this is the

895
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,150
coolest thing ever in the NED then she

896
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,500
got the question of like how do you know

897
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:11,920
when he's gonna go rogue because I'm

898
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:13,360
scared of that yeah yeah because it was

899
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,860
it was a situation I mean I think that

900
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,690
was that was probably the real turning

901
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,670
point at least for me when we go through

902
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:22,090
and we you know do all the documentation

903
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:25,060
thank you Jeff if you need documentation

904
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:27,190
Jeff Pershing amazing but but the

905
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,870
reality is is that and we get developed

906
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,430
all this documentation and pulled it all

907
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,990
together you know getting all things

908
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,200
done you know putting in a little bow

909
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,859
putting the frosting on it and then

910
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,629
afterwards they'd come to me and they

911
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:41,560
say well we need to talk to you just for

912
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:44,670
five minutes I'm like okay and it needs

913
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,990
to be a private conversation okay and

914
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,040
you know you go upstairs like well first

915
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:52,740
off we just wanna let you know that

916
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,509
we've never seen this before never

917
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,879
secondly we don't know what to do here

918
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,950
because we're used to us teaching people

919
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,410
and you're teaching us stuff here and

920
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:05,710
then the last one was you know Dave what

921
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:07,270
am I gonna do about him so but I mean to

922
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,710
be able to be in that kind of a

923
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:13,570
situation and know that in 36 months

924
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:16,480
developing that program bringing on this

925
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:18,430
type of talent and also learning how to

926
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,690
work together so that you could leverage

927
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:27,600
each other's strengths and help each

928
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:27,600
other's weaknesses it was quite amazing

929
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,049
that's what I say that one thing that

930
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:34,020
was unique about Diebold I don't see in

931
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:36,160
a lot of places that I go into is that

932
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,870
you have something like Scott who's an

933
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,730
executive right he's an executive right

934
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,529
here you're an executive right would you

935
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,750
I mean even though we're friends I mean

936
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,320
you're in

937
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:48,440
second okay he's an executive okay even

938
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,630
those in his office and boxers but I've

939
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,010
done a lot too but yeah yeah but one

940
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,460
thing that that was interesting with

941
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:57,560
Scott was Scott wasn't my boss he was a

942
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,820
friend and he was somebody that I could

943
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,490
go to in the event that something

944
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,080
happened and I took those same concepts

945
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:04,189
and applied those to trust at SAC and to

946
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,529
bind their defense and to everything

947
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:08,360
that I've done where I'm not the boss of

948
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,710
trust at SAC I'm not the CEO I'm not the

949
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,670
founder I'm not anybody else I'm

950
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,380
something that you can come and talk to

951
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,850
and we can joke around with and have a

952
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,050
good time with but we also get stuff

953
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:16,520
done you know that I had your back no

954
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,840
matter what and I learned that from

955
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,190
Scott I learned from the team and

956
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,100
everybody on the team had that same

957
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:24,200
opinion so your leadership is really

958
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,759
critical to your success in your

959
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,259
organization if you don't have

960
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,660
leadership that you can go to that that

961
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,250
they implicitly trust you for your

962
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,990
direction and support you and figure out

963
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,030
waste it gets you to be successful and

964
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:38,000
to mentor you then it's time to move to

965
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:39,530
a different place because leadership is

966
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,760
everything in those types of scenarios

967
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:43,850
and I'll tell you the funny story about

968
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,380
that board meeting Scott was the CIO at

969
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,880
the time he got promoted I was the CSO

970
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,680
and I was going to present in front of

971
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,780
the board and it was my first time as

972
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,089
chief security officer of being in

973
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,260
charge of him and you know Scott's like

974
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,430
hey just show up at this time you know

975
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,540
the board be ready for and everything

976
00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:01,129
else and my team decides out of all days

977
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:05,150
that they would fill my entire car with

978
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:07,610
that old mainframe paper and it leaves

979
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,080
these white remnants everywhere I mean

980
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:12,020
it's like it's like it's like literally

981
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:14,390
like like I was I was a snowball at the

982
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,920
end of the day and so I get into my car

983
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:19,009
and I don't have time to clean this

984
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,570
stuff out of my car and I know I'm

985
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:23,570
looking at you too man you're part of

986
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:25,430
that you're guilty he was guilty yeah he

987
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:27,380
was involved in that Ryan over here by

988
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:29,720
the way you talk about talents I was

989
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,370
working in IT had a passion to do

990
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,839
something brought him into security and

991
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:35,930
was one of the best hires we've ever had

992
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,910
and so get over and get over into the

993
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,980
car and I'm literally I got mainframe

994
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:43,399
paper flying all around me I'm in a suit

995
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:45,230
I am completely in white and it's like

996
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,990
all completely over memory and as a dark

997
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:49,910
suit at a blue suit I had a tie on I

998
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:51,109
have dinner at the bar Oh Todd not this

999
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,279
tonight at broad town one time I forgot

1000
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:55,380
about that too

1001
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,089
but I get to the board meeting and Scott

1002
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,829
I mean he's like what inda never mind

1003
00:39:57,089 --> 00:40:02,038
just go you're fine because I can just

1004
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:03,420
just go and and like what am I supposed

1005
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,069
to do up like I'm calm I'm sit here like

1006
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,480
this it's making it worse like it just

1007
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,250
you know I was like literally all white

1008
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,170
and you know presenting front of a board

1009
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,390
as a snowball so I was amazing so but

1010
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,920
you know friendship leadership all of

1011
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,868
those come into play and if your

1012
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,039
leadership isn't approachable to be able

1013
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:19,619
to do what you need to or to bounce

1014
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,019
ideas off of Scout recognizes when I'm

1015
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:23,250
going down a lane and he can understand

1016
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,779
the basic concepts of what I'm talked

1017
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,579
about maybe not the technical pieces of

1018
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:27,630
it but he understands the basic concepts

1019
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:28,859
of what I'm talking about and knows

1020
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,000
that's the right direction and supports

1021
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:33,180
me on that and that's that's leadership

1022
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:42,960
101 right there does anyone ask

1023
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:48,210
questions as you can tell another skill

1024
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:53,490
is storytelling right so you know and

1025
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:55,349
I'm trying to impart value to you so I'm

1026
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:58,828
gonna be a little I'll be the boring one

1027
00:40:55,349 --> 00:41:02,450
again you know I think another thing for

1028
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:06,000
as it's one thing to develop as a leader

1029
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:08,788
it's another thing to as you're doing

1030
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,200
that to develop the leaders that work

1031
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:14,759
for you or work with you and that that

1032
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,379
can be a challenging thing and that's

1033
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:19,109
why you have to have trust you have to

1034
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,569
have confidence and I've always you know

1035
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:23,549
follow the rule hire people that are way

1036
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:28,380
smarter than you so that you do trust

1037
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:31,170
and my job was always another thing that

1038
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:34,440
would impress the business the guys that

1039
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:38,940
run the business is do the right

1040
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:42,180
projects at the right time and that's

1041
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,339
all on us because they don't know what

1042
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:48,118
are necessarily the right projects at

1043
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:50,640
the right time but we do and you know

1044
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:53,819
and in developing folks underneath you

1045
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,368
what I always tried to do is put my

1046
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:59,670
folks in the right place at the right

1047
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:02,279
time and I would push them I would push

1048
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:05,009
them off the curb I would make them

1049
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:07,789
uncomfortable because I trusted them and

1050
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:10,489
we always got things done

1051
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:13,130
with the volume of work that the team's

1052
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:15,649
this team the teams that I build because

1053
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,799
of those kind of principles always

1054
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:20,739
outperformed any of the other

1055
00:42:17,799 --> 00:42:23,419
organizations within the respective or

1056
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:26,029
company because of that so right

1057
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:27,979
projects at the right time

1058
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:30,939
and we all know that right we all know

1059
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:34,638
when we're doing something that probably

1060
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:39,109
should be a little lower priority it's

1061
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:42,049
up to you to voice that the credit that

1062
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:45,199
you will get will enable you to do

1063
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:49,099
things that are almost unheard of and

1064
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:52,729
I'm gonna the last thing I'll say the

1065
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:57,259
confidence that this team built at

1066
00:42:52,729 --> 00:43:01,038
Diebold allowed us to do some remarkable

1067
00:42:57,259 --> 00:43:02,779
things on an operational perspective but

1068
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:08,359
I'll tell you what it was all tested one

1069
00:43:02,779 --> 00:43:14,329
day when there was a global hack of ATMs

1070
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:17,749
and it was a Diebold ATM I mean this was

1071
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:20,209
no kids play this was this ended up

1072
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:24,499
having us go all travel all over the

1073
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:28,578
world I don't know where you are as you

1074
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:31,879
could have been and and the approach was

1075
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:34,489
at the time you know so then you heard

1076
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,809
the the board and the CI the CEO they

1077
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:39,409
came to me and said what are we going to

1078
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:41,630
do and I was the only one with this

1079
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:43,639
approach all the other executive vice

1080
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:46,429
presidents which were above me wanted to

1081
00:43:43,639 --> 00:43:52,159
do something different I said we are

1082
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:55,369
going to go public with this breach we

1083
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:58,429
are going to take away all of the

1084
00:43:55,369 --> 00:44:01,309
presses ability to attack us and at the

1085
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:05,179
time that was unheard of and no one

1086
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:08,859
wanted to do that except for me and I

1087
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:13,519
convinced the CEO and the board because

1088
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:16,969
they believed in in US and it was very

1089
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:20,269
very effective we we went out there we

1090
00:44:16,969 --> 00:44:21,550
we pushed it took away all of their all

1091
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:25,759
of their

1092
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:29,030
negative publicity and it was successful

1093
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,640
we really did not our our market share

1094
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:34,910
didn't really have an impact and we did

1095
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:38,509
some incredible things and the only way

1096
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:44,330
you get to do that is by instilling a

1097
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:46,100
level of confidence that only a team can

1098
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:47,480
bring because you know I knew that we

1099
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:52,520
were gonna able to pull these things off

1100
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:55,400
I knew that I would let David you know

1101
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:58,520
maybe go a little bit off path because

1102
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:01,100
if I had confidence if yeah you know

1103
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:05,330
what if something kind of bad happens we

1104
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:08,600
had the ability to correct it very very

1105
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:10,940
quick and if I didn't have that type of

1106
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:14,540
trust do you think I would have let him

1107
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:17,450
do half the things he did hell no but we

1108
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:19,640
did and and you know comprising a team

1109
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:23,359
that all benefit and play off of one

1110
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:26,720
another and made us as a whole you know

1111
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,910
one pretty incredible team that that's

1112
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,129
what you do and that's when you generate

1113
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:33,680
value that's when your budgets aren't

1114
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:36,890
denied that's when you get to do really

1115
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:41,690
cool things that I make it easy for you

1116
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:44,779
to recruit and retain help you develop

1117
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:47,270
if you don't do all of these things you

1118
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:50,930
end up getting stuck kind of in an

1119
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:53,509
organization that you don't have control

1120
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:56,419
over the people that don't understand

1121
00:45:53,510 --> 00:46:00,050
and necessarily appreciate all the value

1122
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:03,020
that you bring so courageous

1123
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:04,970
authenticity is what I call it and I

1124
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:08,420
challenge all of you to be very

1125
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:11,600
courageous and what you do I challenge

1126
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:13,040
all of you to learn the business that

1127
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:17,868
you live in because they're different

1128
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,880
and it will change every time you go you

1129
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:23,750
do those things and especially if you

1130
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:26,960
aspire to to lead and and you will be

1131
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:29,560
successful I've tested this I've applied

1132
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,420
it at five different global

1133
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,330
organizations and we've been able to do

1134
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,910
things

1135
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:42,150
that none of my predecessors were able

1136
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:44,879
to do basic stuff let me let me quickly

1137
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:46,620
say along those lines is that as a

1138
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,260
security professional there gonna be

1139
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:51,540
times you know they say our industry is

1140
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,090
negative 20 percent employment rate so

1141
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:56,100
you can jump around all over the place

1142
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,980
you can always get another job you can

1143
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:02,850
always get more money don't do that

1144
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:06,180
don't do that you know know that there

1145
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:08,910
are times you need to accomplish

1146
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:10,859
something where you are in just because

1147
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,930
it's hard and just because people oppose

1148
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:15,810
you doesn't mean that you shouldn't stay

1149
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:17,879
there and actually accomplish that thing

1150
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:19,590
that you need to accomplish and you may

1151
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,780
have to say and do things that are

1152
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:24,150
really not good for your career

1153
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,490
but they're good for the company those

1154
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:30,720
are the things that will propel you to

1155
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:34,080
the next level yeah I mean I agree I

1156
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:37,319
think that um over the years

1157
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:39,630
I know that I when I left Diebold and

1158
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,690
came to Lincoln I really wanted to be a

1159
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,190
situation that I could emulate someday a

1160
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,290
security team and I didn't go into

1161
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:48,510
security at Lincoln I started off in

1162
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:51,720
systems development and Scott had

1163
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:53,840
mentioned you know I agree I think that

1164
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,850
being the CIO you're much more impactful

1165
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,950
being able to direct security being in

1166
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:00,810
charge of systems development I helped

1167
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,460
to bridge that gap to make sure that my

1168
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:04,980
systems developers knew there wasn't an

1169
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,770
option you know they they had to be

1170
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,660
supportive of the security now doing the

1171
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:12,930
information security and doing

1172
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,430
infrastructure it's been nice to make

1173
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:17,000
sure that the teams don't have competing

1174
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:19,230
agendas and then if they know the key

1175
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,970
principles that they have to follow you

1176
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:24,780
know in making sure that we're growing

1177
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:26,640
our program and everybody wins but with

1178
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,020
that you know I think that the most

1179
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,359
important thing comes down to the people

1180
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:33,680
in that organization I'm personally

1181
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:37,920
proud that I feel like I've emulated a

1182
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:39,569
portion of what we had at a Depot I'm

1183
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,220
hoping my team will at some point in

1184
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:44,640
time think the same have the same type

1185
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:47,609
of respect and and feel the same just

1186
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,500
devotion that I felt being there

1187
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:51,330
but it has been a true message all along

1188
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,840
that you know there will come a time

1189
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:58,290
when they will outgrow my company and

1190
00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:00,570
they will outgrow our program and when

1191
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:02,340
they do I think that that's the real

1192
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:04,980
dialogue that you can have and being

1193
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,270
that this is such a small community we

1194
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,070
all should think about those things

1195
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:11,460
because there's huge opportunity for

1196
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:14,100
everyone and it's not always the right

1197
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:16,620
fit and you know to the point the grass

1198
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,569
isn't always greener on the other side

1199
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:24,029
sometimes you gotta learn how to water

1200
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:28,020
and grow your own grass and it's it's

1201
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:29,130
definitely a journey talked about a lot

1202
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,870
of the fun and games because I think

1203
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:32,520
it's important to understand having fun

1204
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:34,890
is important but at the end of the day

1205
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,090
it was a very serious you know thing

1206
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,799
that we were accomplishing at the

1207
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,650
organization we had fun while doing it

1208
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,840
right and you know what what was

1209
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:44,880
interesting is I tend to go more towards

1210
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,530
humor and fun and and joking and things

1211
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,420
like that just kind of my personality of

1212
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:50,610
who I am but at the end of day I knew

1213
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,260
that I could rely on everybody with me

1214
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:54,630
that we were all allies kind of working

1215
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,970
for the same goal and you know I learned

1216
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:58,410
and I grew so much from you know a kid

1217
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,930
that that would just want to talk about

1218
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:02,339
cracking encryption to you know being

1219
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,600
able to present in front of a board of

1220
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,610
directors and to being a chief security

1221
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,049
officer of a Fortune 1000 company being

1222
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,460
able to present that program and the

1223
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,320
vision for it and being able to enable

1224
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,970
my team to then take the leadership when

1225
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:15,000
I left you know somebody took my

1226
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:16,259
position that was in my team as well one

1227
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,380
thing I could say is that you know

1228
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:21,570
loyalty is a an amazing concept for

1229
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:23,130
human beings and I can still say that

1230
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:24,780
I'd probably still be at D bowl to this

1231
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:26,070
day if Scott was still there but I also

1232
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,600
probably wouldn't have started trusted

1233
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,910
sack or a binary defense or grown the

1234
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,680
way that I have and started Walter

1235
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:33,750
become has already started but because

1236
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,830
of Scott but I wouldn't have done all

1237
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,540
those things and you know it's

1238
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:38,700
interesting when I started trust at SAC

1239
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,380
I was the chief security officer Diebold

1240
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,000
had a great team a great program and

1241
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,530
nothing to worry about my job was

1242
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,590
perfectly stable everything is was was

1243
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:48,570
fantastic had an amazing team and I went

1244
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,190
home one day and I'm like man I think I

1245
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:51,630
can build this for other companies and

1246
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:53,160
help other companies out and I'm not

1247
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,600
sure if I want to do this for this one

1248
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,970
company my entire life maybe it's time

1249
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,490
to let somebody else lead this team and

1250
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,730
to run forward and I went to my wife one

1251
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,348
day and she had just given birth

1252
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:06,160
which is a great time to start a brand

1253
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:08,530
new company by the way amazing and I

1254
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,328
actually called Scott and I said Scott

1255
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:12,880
I'm looking at doing this and he said

1256
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:15,280
Dave I think he said David he says David

1257
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,869
all the time David he's like I think

1258
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,950
that's an amazing idea and he's like I

1259
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:19,329
know that you're gonna be successful in

1260
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,859
anything that you do he's like go for it

1261
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:23,079
and you know whatever I can do to help

1262
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:25,779
you out just just let me know you know

1263
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:28,000
we're still a team and that day I

1264
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,650
decided to start trusted SEC and you

1265
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,570
know it's been a amazing ride ever since

1266
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:33,369
then gave me are making my first

1267
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:35,560
contract the very first customer I ever

1268
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:36,820
had was with Scott's Scott's company at

1269
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,900
the time and worked with them for a

1270
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:40,119
number of times until I can get on my

1271
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:41,430
feet and that alone was what's

1272
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,050
insurmountable so when I talk about

1273
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:46,390
Scott and his team being the foundation

1274
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:47,980
for my success in my career and

1275
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:49,328
everything else I mean it I you know the

1276
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,369
team that we had there the things that I

1277
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:52,720
learned all came from a team I was

1278
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:55,329
willing to do anything to accomplish a

1279
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,009
goal and that goal was was making our

1280
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:59,200
company or organization our customers

1281
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:01,720
better and working with other people to

1282
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:10,750
go and do it see we have any questions

1283
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:22,328
yeah question one story that they

1284
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:23,770
wouldn't believe I mean they knew most I

1285
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:25,210
mean I would do they know we do like

1286
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,560
joke stuff like I put like crickets in

1287
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,730
their office like the the it was like a

1288
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,960
random crickets sound that would come

1289
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:31,630
over like 10 minutes and random

1290
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,089
intervals that was fun

1291
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:36,130
Scott the second week I worked there I

1292
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:38,170
called Jess I'm like hey am I gonna get

1293
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:41,770
fired if I lockpick Scott's office and I

1294
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:42,730
built a fort out of cardboard and she's

1295
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:45,369
like no this actually sounds like a good

1296
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:47,259
idea so he locked back this door

1297
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:49,059
build a forehead like a castle

1298
00:52:47,259 --> 00:52:52,059
everything had a shield and a sword

1299
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:53,650
I was pretty awesome yeah there are

1300
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:55,630
certain ones that we did where you know

1301
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,519
there was one I still I don't think that

1302
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:00,089
this day Stacy knows about it but there

1303
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:03,459
was a guy named Stacy Gregerson and and

1304
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:05,769
we we took apart his keyboard and we

1305
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,869
soldered a 10z device to it and it would

1306
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:09,129
randomly move his mouse up to the left

1307
00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:11,559
and start randomly clicking every at

1308
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:12,759
random intervals and as his keyboard

1309
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:14,920
doing it so it didn't look like keys

1310
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:16,150
that were generating and I forgot about

1311
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,749
it I went on a business trip for two

1312
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:21,130
weeks and I came back and Stacy was like

1313
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:22,689
literally ready to quit and he's like

1314
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:24,789
he's like I've replaced my laptop I

1315
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:26,289
replaced my my mouse I've replaced my

1316
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:27,430
monitor nothing's working never replace

1317
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:28,660
the keyboard cuz it was you know it's a

1318
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:29,828
mouse that was doing the entire time

1319
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,910
he's like I've replaced everything he's

1320
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:34,210
like I literally want to kill anybody

1321
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:35,469
and so so I had a coli to call Stacy in

1322
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,489
my office the time like hasty steak I

1323
00:53:35,469 --> 00:53:38,019
talked about something really important

1324
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:39,880
had Josh which is keyboard I with a

1325
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:41,618
legitimate one at the time and disabled

1326
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,400
the tin Z device so that we did it so

1327
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:50,319
there's some pranks I can go go awry but

1328
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:51,999
no I think so I don't have to remember

1329
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:54,038
this there was why I should probably

1330
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:56,499
shouldn't say this but there was there

1331
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:58,299
was one yeah we did survive we're not

1332
00:53:56,499 --> 00:54:00,879
there anymore so there was one thing we

1333
00:53:58,299 --> 00:54:05,130
we were also a little creative in our

1334
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,130
education and awareness program and

1335
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:11,529
Scott had made the decision I don't know

1336
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:14,379
who suggested it to him but we had a

1337
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:20,319
board meeting coming up so we figured

1338
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:23,019
we'd test it out by putting CDs all over

1339
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,369
the hotel where the executives were

1340
00:54:23,019 --> 00:54:27,339
gonna be so that we could test whether

1341
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:30,369
or not they would install them in their

1342
00:54:27,339 --> 00:54:33,670
laptops and unfortunately it was

1343
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:36,549
probably like 80% of they did it right

1344
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:40,509
and I don't think you were in I don't

1345
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:42,640
think you were there yet okay so yeah

1346
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:44,559
yeah so he was working as a contractor

1347
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,589
he was still with the other company and

1348
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,210
we got him back and I we got I think it

1349
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:50,799
was such a situation because they said

1350
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,180
something about pictures like these were

1351
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,499
the pictures from the prior day which by

1352
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,700
the way there was nobody there to take

1353
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:56,979
pictures so why they would think that

1354
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,058
there was pictures I have no idea but it

1355
00:54:56,979 --> 00:54:59,160
was all about the pictures from the

1356
00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:01,170
previous day

1357
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,970
so we get these things back and we're

1358
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:04,230
like oh this is really bad because you

1359
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:05,669
know this tells us like where the

1360
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:08,040
program really is and what we really got

1361
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:11,840
to do well kind of like what do we do

1362
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:16,250
with this data no right because we can't

1363
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,250
and we didn't tell anybody

1364
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:35,069
oh gosh I got it tell us no I got okay

1365
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:42,330
so I'm gonna tell one on you and you're

1366
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:45,720
gonna tell him I'm totally doing it so

1367
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:48,270
so my son in high school in high school

1368
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,500
he was there the Cisco Academy there in

1369
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:52,550
his high school and he went through that

1370
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:56,280
and I got him an internship at d-ball

1371
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:59,400
he's like 17 years old you know tall kid

1372
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:01,590

1373
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,890
the networking Department for Diebold

1374
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:07,770
and we had these little like little tiny

1375
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:09,600
boobs for contractors like where they

1376
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:13,080
sat it was like just bigger than a

1377
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:15,180
keyboard right and he sat there and

1378
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:19,200
right on the other side of the wall was

1379
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:22,740

1387
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:43,950

1388
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:50,220

1391
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,880
gonna sneak out and I went around and

1392
00:56:54,270 --> 00:57:06,060

1395
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:11,299

1397
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:26,819
from BTS so this this is recent I mean

1398
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:27,900
this is like in the last month so we

1399
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:30,690
recently

1400
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:33,569
yeah it's fresh cuz Dave actually does

1401
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:36,990
work for me right so what we do stuff

1402
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:40,920
work well his team does so maybe if it

1403
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:42,509
BTS was we recently had a situation a

1404
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,880
small situation something didn't get

1405
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:46,049
caught and I send a note today but I'm

1406
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,760
like hey Dave you know this is a

1407
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:50,460
situation you know what's the case and

1408
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,079
he shoots back this email like oh my

1409
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,819
gosh this is ridiculous I'm gonna make

1410
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,740
sure that I talk to this person you know

1411
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:57,900
I've already had the discussion this is

1412
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:59,788
terrible this is unacceptable I sent him

1413
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:07,079
back a text I'm like hey dude I think

1414
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:09,270
we're overreacting just a little bit so

1415
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:10,349
I'm like you you might want to like you

1416
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:12,450
know just take this as a learning

1417
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:14,460
opportunity and maybe we could like talk

1418
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:18,500
to the guy about it and he immediately

1419
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:18,500
calls me and he's like hey are you okay

1420
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:31,140
yeah why I'm like he's like okay just

1421
00:58:25,529 --> 00:58:32,789
that's not you jae-hoon I hope you

1422
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:34,710
learned a lot of lessons on what we did

1423
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:37,289
as a team and I think most importantly

1424
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:39,480
you heard team in people and you cannot

1425
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:40,970
accomplish a security program without a

1426
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,440
team and without a people without

1427
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:44,700
appropriate leadership and it's not a

1428
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,289
product of technology the technology

1429
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,549
fits something or initiative that you're

1430
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:49,079
trying to accomplish that people the

1431
00:58:47,549 --> 00:58:50,490
ones that support it and one thing that

1432
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:51,869
I think that the team really recognized

1433
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:54,419
is that you can't have new pieces of

1434
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:55,829
technology in place when you don't have

1435
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:58,760
the people to support that technology

1436
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:58,760
introduced that complexity
