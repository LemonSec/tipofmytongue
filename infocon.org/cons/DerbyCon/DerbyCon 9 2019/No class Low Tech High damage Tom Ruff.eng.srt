00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,899
good morning Derby Khan must not have

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,760
been too much of a party last night

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,139
because everybody's already up before 11

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,088
[Music]

5
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:18,630
perfect perfect

6
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:20,640
so just a quick introduction this is a

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,109
true story this happened about a year

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,330
and a half ago to a friend of mine so I

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,269
gathered the information added a little

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,480
stuff to it and as far as technical

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:36,390
thing or technical jargon and then we're

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:41,578
going to talk about it so this is no

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:44,340
class low tech high damage Who am I just

14
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,520
a nobody really I'm just a lucky guy

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,460
who's got some really smart friends pen

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,149
test fail who might be in the room sky

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,180

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,890
Dave Kennedy Chris Hogg Negi been a

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,930
developer for 20-plus years I was

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,660
reformed about six years ago and started

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,750
getting into security been attending

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:11,850
cons I've helped run Scott Oake on for

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:15,539
three years so that's about that

24
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,189
what the talks about it's about social

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,549
engineering us I borrowed this

26
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,630
definition from Chris's site social

27
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,490
engineer org any act that influences a

28
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,170
person that may or may not be in their

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,360
best interest and in this particular

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,700
case what the person was trying to do to

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:39,060
manipulate the people was definitely not

32
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:42,090
in their best interests okay so here's

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,210
where we get into the setup the the

34
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,960
person picked up a free job listing from

35
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,270
a well-known company I'm not gonna say

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,100
the name but there should be a hint on

37
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,869
the screen it tells you who they got an

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,610
account through they can they stole a

39
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,399
company name from somebody who was not

40
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,649
an area that they were targeting they

41
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,200
put up a job posting said hey we're

42
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:11,009
opening a new office in this mid-sized

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,400
city they definitely specifically

44
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,349
targeted

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,819
office manager administrative assistant

46
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:19,540
because they were looking for somebody

47
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:23,500
who didn't have a degree not necessarily

48
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,760
a lot of technical expertise but they

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,980
were looking for somebody who had

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,780
experience so they could target the age

51
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,810
group that they were looking for and

52
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,400
they were offering about 25 26 percent

53
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,370
higher than the average income of the

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,620
area and it was closer to 30 percent

55
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,879
above what this position would normally

56
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,569
pay in this space

57
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,980
so it was a big candy cane to put out in

58
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,950
front of somebody to try to get as many

59
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,858
people to apply as possible if you take

60
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:54,129
a look this is the actual first reply

61
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:56,829
that came back I did block out the names

62
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:59,349
of the company that they were they had

63
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:03,459
stolen the information from - to get

64
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:04,629
started so if you see in me read about

65
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,109
the middle of the page

66
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:10,268
they were looking at $21 an hour and you

67
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:12,819
know in the area where we're at

68
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:17,220
Charleston South Carolina yes we

69
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:19,599
survived the hurricane that's probably

70
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,239
five to six dollars above what that

71
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,418
position would normally pay an hour so

72
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,819
they they were definitely trying to

73
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:32,199
encourage as much as possible the very

74
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:34,179
first reply that came back they asked a

75
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:36,430
lot of questions how soon can you start

76
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,510
so anybody who's listened to any of the

77
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:43,209
social engineering talks around the area

78
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,888
when you feel that emotional feeling you

79
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,780
want to take a closer look at it so

80
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:49,209
they're asking right off the bat how

81
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,129
soon can you start they're offering a

82
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,220
significant pay raise to what you're

83
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:59,108
making they asked some typical interview

84
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,879
questions so from from here as I'll talk

85
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:04,120
a little bit more as we get more into it

86
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:08,280
this actually did go through a fairly

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:12,790
well-built interview process which was

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,069
pretty interesting stealing the word

89
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,219
from wrestling the mark the person that

90
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:21,070
you're going after mid-career employees

91
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,820
you're looking for somebody who's well

92
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,349
out of high school not requiring a

93
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,840
degree though so you're looking

94
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,280
somebody who's high school-educated

95
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,130
you're looking for people who are at or

96
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,619
below the average salary of the area so

97
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,050
that that that character Drew bangle and

98
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,060
out in front of you really brings

99
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,850
forward and they're also by not

100
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,320
requiring a degree not requiring a bunch

101
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,570
of technical skills they're looking for

102
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,300
people who have very limited technical

103
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,010
knowledge so they're trying to target

104
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:56,890
somebody that they can take advantage of

105
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:58,990
which is absolutely horrible initially

106
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:02,409
you couldn't really tell what the goals

107
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:05,680
were really looking for personal

108
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,190
information where they just messing

109
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,630
around where they trying to get money

110
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,600
but they definitely followed this quote

111
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:16,150
from Jesse the body Ventura when if you

112
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,400
can lose a few months but always cheat

113
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,590
as they were definitely cheating they'd

114
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,010
picked up a free email address that

115
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,950
picked up a free account on the unnamed

116
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:30,190
recruiting site they were using Google

117
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:34,450
Voice numbers to work through it and we

118
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:38,560
can talk through a little bit more as I

119
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,420
get over to the timeline day zero they

120
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,930
go out they open the short-term account

121
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,820
with the online recruiter then they

122
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,260
start just collect any information as it

123
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,420
comes in people are applying for a job

124
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,780
you send them your resume it has your

125
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:55,230
name your address your phone number your

126
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:00,250
email address previous employers

127
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:02,050
description of the idea of the jobs that

128
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,740
you've done in the past so there's a ton

129
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,970
of open source information that just was

130
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,800
immediately out the door which made it

131
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:13,240
harder to figure out what they were

132
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,800
looking for they did do some reviewing

133
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,010
other candidates to make sure that they

134
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,200
met the needs I don't know numbers I

135
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:25,510
wasn't able to get that far along and

136
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:29,700
any information but they did reach out

137
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:32,680
and they did multiple phone interviews I

138
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:36,070
wasn't party to the actual interviews

139
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,350
but speaking to the person who helped

140
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,240
figure all this out it

141
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,850
was a reasonable job interview they were

142
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,950
asking questions do you know how to use

143
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,270
office what would you do for this type

144
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,570
of document what would you do for that

145
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,190
type of document so it was reasonable so

146
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,590
then they went to the point of making a

147
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:57,140
verbal offer twenty one dollars an hour

148
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:01,280
that's forty three thousand dollars a

149
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:03,490
year give or take then they asked the

150
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,039
candidate to take time out of their day

151
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,330
go out and price office equipment for

152
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,730
opening up this new office that they

153
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,260
were starting to put into town so the

154
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,070
candidate thinking they've got a new job

155
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:20,500
coming up goes out prices HP printers

156
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,500
prices printer cartridges desks tables

157
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,880
took a significant portion of time out

158
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,980
of their day trying to impress their new

159
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:34,400
bosses trying to find the good prices on

160
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:36,320
things so it was pretty abusive as far

161
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,099
as I would be concerned to take

162
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,570
advantage of somebody this way so after

163
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,920
they get all the prices they figure out

164
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,840
how much it's going to take to get the

165
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,190
equipment that they're looking for they

166
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,349
let the candidate know that they're

167
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:53,840
going to send them a check to pay for

168
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:56,480
the office gear kind of unusual in a new

169
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,310
job situation but from talking to a few

170
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,850
other people not as unusual as I thought

171
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:08,510
it was so then they send out the check

172
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:11,270
via FedEx and if you take a look the

173
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:14,870
person got a FedEx delivery notice the

174
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:17,060
envelope shows up in a FedEx envelope

175
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,440
turns out that the FedEx account

176
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,480
information used to send it had been

177
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:25,190
stolen but we'll get to that in a little

178
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:27,800
bit and there was a real looking

179
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:32,419
corporate check the banking information

180
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:34,490
did match up with the name at the top

181
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:40,848
but we'll find out a little bit more

182
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:44,200
about it and a little bit so they were

183
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,200
very good about timing

184
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,300
they said the FedEx delivery to arrive

185
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:53,320
on a Friday that'll become apparent why

186
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,319
they did that shortly

187
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,500
then they asked a new hire to go out and

188
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,649
buy prepaid Visa gift cards so that they

189
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,880
can track the expenses when you're going

190
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:07,070
to buy the equipment that you've already

191
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:10,760
priced and then of course they ask their

192
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:13,130
new-hire to give them the credit card

193
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,410
information the number so that when they

194
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,360
see the hits on the prepaid credit card

195
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,969
they can see what they bought and do

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,950
their expenses and you know good

197
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:29,480
bookkeeping practices is what they tried

198
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:35,300
to sell it as however when we got to

199
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:37,010
this point the check arrives and if I

200
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,199
pop back to it for just a second

201
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,589
I did block out the name at the top but

202
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,680
the the company name on the cheque did

203
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:49,250
not match the the company that was

204
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:54,140
trying to get hired for so the new hire

205
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:56,570
questions at which anybody would the

206
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,439
hiring manager who's on the phone which

207
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:02,000
happens to be the the fiend in this case

208
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,190
justifies the check by saying that it's

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,870
from one of their subsidiaries so one

210
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,180
company owns another company they issued

211
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:13,970
to check out a subsidiary for whatever

212
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:16,579
reason so as this as this moved on and

213
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,500
this is you know I've had to scrunch

214
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,540
this down for a short talk but this

215
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:28,070
happened over a matter of weeks it

216
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:30,920
wasn't just a single day so a heroine

217
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:34,519
takes over the new hire catches on does

218
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:38,149
a little bit of research goes out and

219
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,339
finds out that while this was being sold

220
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:45,380
as a company in China opening a new

221
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:46,850
office in Charleston she really wasn't

222
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,829
they had a bunch of different places

223
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:55,010
around the United States already so

224
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:57,500
there's the first crack in the wall the

225
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,510
heroin in this case steps up and says

226
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,310
hey I don't have a lot of money in my

227
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,149
account I need to wait for the check to

228
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:07,219
clear and then once this gets a little

229
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:09,800
bit more of it says oh the first check

230
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,529
bounce and calls up the hiring manager

231
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,149
and says hey what's going on a check

232
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:15,829
bounced

233
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:18,290
the hiring manager says oh we've waited

234
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:20,120
too long to cash it we'll send you

235
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:25,009
another check and they did they sent a

236
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,740
second check so at this point there's

237
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:32,029
definitely something wrong our heroine

238
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,470
in this case starts to string along the

239
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:35,750
attacker to try to get as much

240
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,329
information as possible at the same time

241
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:42,310
they've reached out to law enforcement

242
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:42,310
turns out the company who was being

243
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,060
forged I guess would be the right word

244
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,439
on zip recruiter already knew about it

245
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,319
and this has been going on in several

246
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:54,230
places around the country at the same

247
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:56,089
time gathering information

248
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,769
grab the FedEx account number that was

249
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:58,310
used on the letter that was sent turn

250
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,230
that over

251
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:03,829
so whoever on that account could be

252
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,240
notified both of the checks the bank

253
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:09,739
accounts had already been stopped

254
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:12,769
so those checks were gonna bounce when

255
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,290
the second check came through the fiend

256
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:18,350
in this case actually had enough nerve

257
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:21,649
to ask for a receipt of the deposit

258
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:26,000
which is just astounding big brass ones

259
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:31,459
as far as I'm concerned so a little bit

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,759
of magic with Adobe our heroine comes up

261
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:36,920
with a fake deposit receipt to match

262
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:48,620
their fake check to match their fake job

263
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:49,910
posting so the information there shows

264
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,579
that they didn't have very much in their

265
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,410
account start with shows the deposit for

266
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:59,209
the exact amount that was on the check a

267
00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:01,819
little bit of addition so little

268
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:05,660
Photoshop a little creativity and they

269
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:08,059
were able to keep it go on for a little

270
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:14,199
bit longer this went on for about

271
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:16,540
another week at this point the the most

272
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:18,859
frustrating part of it was even though

273
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,389
it was blatantly obvious they were

274
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,870
caught they still tried to push it and

275
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:24,950
still try

276
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:31,279
carry it forward our heroine in this

277
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:33,440
case luckily didn't have a job but our

278
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,630
story had a happy ending but an

279
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,339
unwitting candidate this went on for a

280
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,480
couple of weeks so this person could

281
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:42,080
have already turned in or two weeks

282
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,870
notice left a good job that was you know

283
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,130
wasn't $21 an hour but it was paying the

284
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:52,100
bills they could have gone down to the

285
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:54,230
Walmart the CVS Lowe's wherever picked

286
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:59,480
up two thousand four hundred fifty

287
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:01,910
dollars in prepaid Visa cards that would

288
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,500
once they gave the numbers the money was

289
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,209
going to disappear obviously as soon as

290
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,490
they had the coat out the three-digit

291
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,550
code off the back the money was going to

292
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:13,279
disappear and then two days later and

293
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,529
because it takes about two days for a

294
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,150
bank to bounce through the Fed I'm in

295
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:19,250
your familiar with how the Fed handles

296
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,709
money but they will try a check up to

297
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:27,620
six times before they bounce it

298
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:29,750
completely back the the person's going

299
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,060
to have that check bounced out of their

300
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,700
account then they still owe the money

301
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,640
for the gift cards that money's gone the

302
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,230
checks no good you're gonna have at

303
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,000
least a hundred dollars and fees from

304
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:45,260
your bank because they did try to put

305
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,810
the check through multiple times all

306
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,980
kinds of you know now you've lost twenty

307
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,339
five hundred bucks you're only making

308
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,900
fifteen bucks an hour how are you going

309
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:56,570
to make your mortgage payment your car

310
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,189
payment there's just total devastation

311
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:03,560
that could happen to an unwitting

312
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:07,970
candidate so the the target errs in this

313
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:10,279
case were heartless for sure they were

314
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,620
fairly well skilled and low-tech things

315
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:17,600
coming up and making fake corporate

316
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:22,430
checks getting job postings they were

317
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,959
very good at covering up their lives or

318
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,219
trying to cover up their lives you know

319
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:29,300
oh the check bounced because we waited

320
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:32,240
too long to Cassatt cash it oh the FedEx

321
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:37,128
label didn't get sent

322
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,230
they were also very good at just doing

323
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:40,759
fake interviews kind of like what

324
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,319
they're doing upstairs to practice us to

325
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,939
have helped us get through interviews

326
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,748
better but they were they were pretty

327
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,879
good at it

328
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:49,850
they asked the right questions they had

329
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:52,639
the right ideas really everything fell

330
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:56,839
apart when they tried to rush to getting

331
00:15:52,639 --> 00:16:03,709
a bunch of money which it wasn't wasn't

332
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:04,189
a small amount so what do we learn from

333
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:06,439
it

334
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:07,670
and I didn't put a slide in there for

335
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:10,759
this I wasn't sure I was gonna have

336
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,139
enough time for it but so what are we

337
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,470
learning anytime you look at a job

338
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:18,730
posting take it with a grain of salt no

339
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:22,759
matter what site it's on if it's on

340
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:24,350
Monster careers comm doesn't really

341
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,529
matter unless you're going to a site

342
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,059
that you know is super reputable and

343
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:32,509
you're going directly to the employer

344
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:34,339
site take it with a grain of salt when

345
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:36,980
you click the apply link make sure you

346
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:39,379
pay attention to where it goes when the

347
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,499
first response comes back if it's coming

348
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:46,399
from a gmail address do a google search

349
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:47,779
on the gmail address see if you can see

350
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,470
that somebody else has reported it

351
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:54,829
before when you get further down the

352
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:57,829
line if it smells too sweet or tastes

353
00:16:54,829 --> 00:17:01,878
too good it probably is I've been

354
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:06,529
working for different jobs for 32 many

355
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:08,089
years I've had the best of jobs and I've

356
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:11,659
had the worst of jobs and I can tell you

357
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:14,569
that it's always gonna be just a little

358
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:19,189
worse than it tastes if you but if you

359
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:23,389
can handle the taste then it's probably

360
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:25,339
a pretty good thing even though law

361
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:28,220
enforcement was very frustrated with

362
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:30,918
this group and they have not yet to my

363
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:37,309
knowledge made any progress on capturing

364
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:40,149
them still take the time play around

365
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:42,440
with them have some fun but in the end

366
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:44,989
turn it over to law enforcement because

367
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,270
people who are doing this kind of stuff

368
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,710
are gonna hurt people may not be

369
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,059
somebody that you care about may not

370
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,220
even be somebody that you know but

371
00:17:50,059 --> 00:18:00,889
people who are in a in a position to

372
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:02,300
lose a lot so that's kind of the point

373
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:29,179
anybody else have any other comments

374
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:32,120
about sure the judge should probably

375
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:35,900
need the Morning Sun but the question I

376
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,178
have you know sue this crew has gone

377
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:40,460
around the several states or several

378
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:43,340
charities who said do we have any idea

379
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,320
how much they actually rather how rough

380
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:52,070
how many victims have actually fallen

381
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:53,360
into the base and they're out the the

382
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,790
law enforcement were pretty tight-lipped

383
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,850
about it they were saying thank you for

384
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,770
the information but I can't really give

385
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,969
you additional information because

386
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:09,950
that's compromising other people so the

387
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:11,750
the focus on it was more of they were

388
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,620
taking in information rather than giving

389
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,600
it out so I would like to know I would

390
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:26,050
love to know I just don't know at this

391
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:28,969
point it did go to federal so that was

392
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:30,500
FBI was involved which is normally the

393
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,050
truth who would be involved in something

394
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:37,190
like this the amount of money definitely

395
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:39,379
made it a felony for sure crossing state

396
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,000
lines because they even the Google Voice

397
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,840
number that they were used in was from

398
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,390
Northern California I think I left it in

399
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,178
the email for the people who are using

400
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,030
false stuff no protection for the people

401
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:56,000
who in this they were innocent victims I

402
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,879
blocked out as much suck it sure Hinda

403
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,560
back

404
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:15,540
so how have you seen heard of revolution

405
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:17,850
for as many of these guys I know that

406
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:21,840
I've talked to probably a half a dozen

407
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:24,240
people probably two or three more people

408
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:30,120
since I got here who saw the description

409
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:31,770
of the talk and it seems like maybe 20

410
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,739
percent or people will string them along

411
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,150
but then I only know of one person who

412
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,040
actually went to law enforcement so

413
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,650
that's why I'm pushing that point with

414
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,330
what I'm saying here at the end is

415
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,280
definitely turn it over there you may

416
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,439
not have any luck but but they might

417
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,080
make that one mistake and if they do

418
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,230
then then we can give them what they

419
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,230
deserve

420
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:04,790
[Music]

421
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:11,100
no I mean at that point all they have is

422
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:25,980
some open source in telling in all the

423
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:27,719
time so it's minimal true but after but

424
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:32,870
from equal facts that's out there anyway

425
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,870
but yeah you're right in the back

426
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,919
so that's like six or eight people

427
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:51,690
I saw one question over here I thought

428
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:55,220
no all right so thanks derbycon

429
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,220
thank you for the opportunity to speak

430
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,840

431
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:05,840
my bag so you know
