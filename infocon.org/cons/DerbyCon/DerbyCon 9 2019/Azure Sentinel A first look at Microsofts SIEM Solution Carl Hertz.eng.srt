1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,940
you're now honorary Chicagoans so if

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:12,210
you're here for the isère Sentinel talk

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,790
you're in the right space I've got a few

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,980
assumptions of the audience here first

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,240
is you know what a sim is even if you

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,430
don't know how to pronounce it because

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,209
it makes no sense because there are sims

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:30,830
and seems to become sims anyway

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:34,340
you have some understanding of as your

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:37,920
I'll speak up better

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,530
let's move this and again any one of

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,260

actually I'm not and this is just

27
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,060
something to warn you that bad news is

28
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,820
coming

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,310
whenever you see goats on the screen

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,529
expect the worst

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,770
I'm not actually Dave Grohl I know this

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:51,040
is a surprise my name is Karl Hertz I'm

33
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:53,800
the director of IT at elevate energy in

34
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,520
Chicago Illinois I've been doing this

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:00,130
for about 30 years and security for 12

36
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,780
I'm on the board for blue team comm we

37
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:06,160
got some blue team Connor people here

38
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:10,389
who aren't even paying attention Frank a

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:13,090
co-founder of cocktail calm and dr. jane

40
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:20,079
goodall says I hug like a chimp so

41
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:21,400
there's my odd fact about me so as I

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,580
said I've been doing this kind of stuff

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,260
for 30 years you know throw up some of

44
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,780
the systems that I've implemented over

45
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,720
those years this is just to give you

46
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,610
more of an idea of my background

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,720
technically and what I do I've been an

48
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:40,180
Operations person for most of my career

49
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,570
setting up and breaking systems on a

50
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,730
regular basis this list is going to keep

51
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,790
going for a while just to give you an

52
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,799
idea of some of the different areas of

53
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,560
IT and security that I've been involved

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,330
with I've been everywhere from in a call

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,980
center to managing a call center to

56
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,459
being the director of security to doing

57
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,399
Incident Response and again in my

58
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:06,010
current role of director of IT I am

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,640
responsible for making sure that

60
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:13,179
security compliance and policy is taken

61
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,690
care of and met and I think that's

62
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,010
that's it except for the important one

63
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,269
well I broken a lot of over the

64
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,359
years

65
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:28,090
Microsoft that's why we're here right

66
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:31,240
more specifically Microsoft Azure how

67
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:35,740
many Microsoft people in the room yeah

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:43,870
and how many of you are actually using

69
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:47,550
a sure decent number cool so in this

70
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:50,980
talk gonna go over an overview of what

71
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:53,560
Sentinel is talk about how it does data

72
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,079
collection how it does alerts and

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,200
dashboards and a touch on playbooks

74
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,780
notebooks and just do kind of a summary

75
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,750
of my experience for those of you who

76
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,750
are not fully aware of Sentinel it is a

77
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,960
preview release are not even a preview

78
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,870
release it's uh it is out there for a

79
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,630
non production system so I will say this

80
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,030
right off the bat if you're interested

81
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,320
in Sentinel don't roll it out in your

82
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:25,659
production environment at this time

83
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:32,050
things change rapidly in it currently so

84
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:36,010
let's start our overview so it has some

85
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:39,550
basic components from the entire Azure

86
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:43,210
platform kind of rolled together log out

87
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,070
in log analytics the data explorer kuso

88
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,650
query language if any of you are

89
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,690
familiar with that that's their language

90
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,900
that they wrote for doing high-speed

91
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,870
queries the is your fusion machine

92
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,870
landing the playbooks

93
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,320
which are essentially just logic

94
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:04,750
decision-makers and notebooks which are

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,980
hosted in the Jupiter system now I'll

96
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,980
touch on that a little bit as well

97
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,479
so some of the features that they are

98
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:19,159
touting about this is that will keep

99
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,650
your data for two years exporting data

100
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:23,960
to other systems is planned but not yet

101
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,179
implemented so that for compliance

102
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,060
reasons if you have longer periods than

103
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,539
two years it should be available to do

104
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,699
that in the future it is what's called

105
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:37,400
security orchestration automation and

106
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:40,400
respond source or who here has heard of

107
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,580
soar yet Wow

108
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,219
good good percentage of you so for those

109
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,770
who don't it's basically as I kind of

110
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:51,800
touched on before there was sim and SEM

111
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:56,568
and now we've got sim again but spelled

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,789
seam and sorr is the next level which I

113
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:02,479
guess is supposed to get rid of your

114
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:04,669
analysts in the NOC no not really but

115
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,770
you know if you listen to Gartner that's

116
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:08,750
what they say but obviously it's not

117
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:13,729
that but it is supposed to automate some

118
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:15,529
of that response for you it links into

119
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:19,758
the Microsoft intelligence security

120
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:22,610
graph which last I read takes in about

121
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,259
nine trillion records a day so if you're

122
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,690
ever wondering why in Windows 10 you

123
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:30,110
can't shut off all the telemetry it's

124
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:33,500
part of that nine trillion and it's

125
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,330
currently free as in beer which is

126
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,120
really nice that they're rolling this

127
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:41,120
out to the community to test at no no

128
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:44,300
per user cost there are a costs

129
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,339
associated with your as your account you

130
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,529
still have to pay for storage and stuff

131
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:53,270
like that but the actual service of

132
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:56,210
centinall does not have an additional

133
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,279
upfront cost to start with so it's a

134
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,520
good time to kind of dive in and play

135
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,449
around with it and not worry about

136
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:07,430
everything that you're going to be all

137
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:09,289
the costs are going to be incurring so

138
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,120
let's go over some sim use cases I'm

139
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:12,289
sure a lot of you already know this but

140
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,900
I'm just going to kind of break it down

141
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:17,719
into the categories that I think about

142
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,099
when I think sim you've got event

143
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:22,879
detection issues you've got

144
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:25,729
investigation issues

145
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,550
you've got incident response issues and

146
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:31,938
of course you've got compliance issues

147
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:34,460
which is a big one for me what a lot of

148
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:36,919
people the mistake that a lot of

149
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,169
companies make when they are rolling out

150
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,068
a sim is that they try to do all of this

151
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:44,900
at once

152
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:47,089
and usually fails miserably when you are

153
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,460
setting up a sim it is really important

154
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:51,589
that you prioritize what you're wanting

155
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,748
to do what are the main concerns that

156
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:56,539
you want to aggregate data for your

157
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:59,360
company and start picking those off one

158
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:02,688
at a time and so you have your project

159
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,240
to launch your sim but then it's it's a

160
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:07,520
iterative process like much of security

161
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,710
that every year or every quarter or

162
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,299
whatever timeframe you're going by you

163
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,128
look at what's your next level of

164
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,729
improvement and start adding those

165
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,729
things in

166
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:22,160
so let's get to data sources here in a

167
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:26,000
sim you're generally wanting to get as

168
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,720
much data in as possible to be useful

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,390
for you again just have a few of the

170
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,440
data sources listed here but quite

171
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:38,809
technically anything with a log can and

172
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,630
should be able to go into a sim now you

173
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:43,760
don't necessarily want to log everything

174
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,490
especially if you're using a sim that is

175
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,790
on a per dollar charge for data

176
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,500
throughput the fact that matter is it's

177
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,870
just not a good way to do things anyway

178
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,970
I guess it's the sim is not the central

179
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,150
log system the sim is the analysis

180
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:00,970
system

181
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:04,810
and this is just some general bad news

182
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:07,089
is that of course you're not the NSA or

183
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,359
actually I didn't ask that anyone here

184
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:16,600
from the NSA no okay

185
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:18,580
Jeff man's out smoking anyway so again

186
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,210
many of the data sources as I mentioned

187
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,890
are too high volume DHCP and net flows

188
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:28,270
and endpoint detection response

189
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:34,000
telemetry system on even unfiltered can

190
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:40,439
be massive and of course DNS which as we

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,440
all know it was DNS rule number one

192
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,739
so you have to pick and choose your data

193
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:52,368
sources again fortunately right now for

194
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:54,230
the preview release of Sentinel you

195
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:57,249
don't have to worry about a lot of those

196
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,249
costs to start with

197
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,770
so first thing we're doing when we're

198
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,020
actually setting up as your and you can

199
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,480
do it yourself you have to have it as

200
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,710
your as your subscription excuse me I'll

201
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,710
get that pronunciation right one of

202
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,810
these years you create your log

203
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,820
analytics workspace as I mentioned

204
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:21,339
earlier it is kind of the backbone of

205
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:24,370
what Sentinel does you create and as

206
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:27,160
your Security Center workspace you

207
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,290
deploy the Sentinel product and you

208
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,670
deploy the machine learning product

209
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:36,910
through a PowerShell script for me it

210
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:41,260
took 15 minutes to do this I've deployed

211
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:43,600
three other sims and it was much longer

212
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,930
than 15 minutes

213
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,050
so it's pretty impressive how Microsoft

214
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:54,430
has taken a lot of their existing

215
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:58,469
technologies and for a lack of a better

216
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,469
term macgyvered it into a sim

217
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,509
let's go into the data collection

218
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,969
process which is first obviously you've

219
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:09,639
got your sim posted but you need to get

220
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:14,399
actual logs into your sim

221
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:14,399
so how has Microsoft dealt with this

222
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:21,509
well they have a bunch of connectors

223
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:24,310
which are just in and your usual tiled

224
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:26,379
Microsoft look where hey we want to

225
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,609
connect as your Active Directory it's a

226
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:34,689
button you click it and you click ok and

227
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:38,139
it's in all of these products that you

228
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:41,800
see here the ten here in addition to

229
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:44,889
other outside sources are literally two

230
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:48,609
clicks away from adding to your sim it's

231
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:51,220
quite fantastic and at this point of my

232
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,430
adventure of deploying it I was

233
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,069
pleasantly thrilled to see that I could

234
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:01,000
get a large part of my organization's

235
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:03,689
data into the application without much

236
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,689
frustration

237
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:10,319
so all 10 of these took about an hour

238
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:13,890
that's it so again we're an hour and 15

239
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,160
in to my messing around with Sentinel

240
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:20,699
and I've got a large amount of telemetry

241
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:25,530
coming in and going in and being

242
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:28,650
processed by Sentinel connecting on-prem

243
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:32,850
machines obviously requires an agent for

244
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:35,430
Windows pretty straightforward Linux

245
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:40,470
instructions could be clearer especially

246
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:42,630
when you're doing the the CF style of

247
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,240
data for those of you who aren't

248
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,960
familiar with Ceph it is basically

249
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,320
syslog on steroids so it gives you a lot

250
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,320
more data

251
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:03,010
so a little side note here for those of

252
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:07,180
you who are primarily and Active

253
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:10,300
Directory organizations just a campaign

254
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:14,050
at Microsoft did a nice blog post on

255
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,550
windows event forwarding oh and by the

256
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,560
way for those of you taking pictures go

257
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,229
ahead but I will have the slide deck

258
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,619
available for links and resources in

259
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:26,170
here because as usual the hyperlinks are

260
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:30,220
quite long so it'll be available to you

261
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:33,430
after the program at some point so in

262
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:36,370
her blog she does an excellent job of

263
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:39,160
explaining how to forward all of your

264
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:43,930
events to one machine which gives you

265
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:46,420
one data collection point for a sentinel

266
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:50,589
in this case for however much data that

267
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:53,560
that machine is able to process it's a

268
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:56,050
great feature that I have found just

269
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,270
some general straw polls of asking other

270
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,180
sysadmin not a lot of people are using

271
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:04,300
it and I don't know why because being

272
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:08,589
able to excuse me

273
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:12,160
huh I don't know sorry I can look that

274
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:14,170
up though so it does a really good job

275
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,400
of centralizing all of your windows

276
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:20,860
events logs and then of course there is

277
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:24,490
Taylor Swift's amazing system on config

278
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:26,830
that she put up on decent security which

279
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,050
if any of you have ever gone through a

280
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:32,650
Windows Event log it is about 95 percent

281
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:35,229
 I'm just gonna call it what it

282
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:38,230
is there are people at Microsoft who are

283
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:41,710
like I don't know what that is so it

284
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,410
throws up a lot of garbage and Swift has

285
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:47,710
done an excellent job of creating an XML

286
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:50,050
file that filters out a lot of those

287
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,210
issues that you don't need to see and

288
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,810
that you don't need to have your sim

289
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:57,820
analyze so it's a good way to before it

290
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,680
even hits your sim to reduce your data

291
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:06,100
and your data sizes and again it is

292
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,020
really really good to be able to deploy

293
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,150
through group policy it's very easy to

294
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,010
push it out to every machine every

295
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,990
Windows machine on your network and

296
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:17,230
there is a new test version that

297
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:19,990
includes DNS so use it at your own risk

298
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,060
it is currently in alpha mode but it

299
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:25,530
will take your DNS records from all of

300
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,530
your workstations and servers as well

301
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:33,939
so again the bad news for some reason

302
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,150
you have to post a Linux server for sis

303
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,090
logging why doesn't a juror have a

304
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:47,620
syslog service anyone from Microsoft

305
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:49,450
able to answer that though it's so again

306
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,990
it seemed kind of odd

307
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:55,530
that in order to bring in sis logs from

308
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:58,780
everything I had to post a syslog server

309
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:00,699
again most of you probably probably

310
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,310
already have a Linux this log server in

311
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,440
your environment you can have it image

312
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,869
or you can have it on Prem it doesn't

313
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,700
matter but you still need to have that

314
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,900
Linux server running rather than a

315
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:17,200
service through a job and again setting

316
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:20,260
up syslog there are no pre-loaded

317
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,540
facilities I had to manually type in all

318
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,030
the syslog facilities that I wanted to

319
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,790
collect and it wasn't even check boxes

320
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,819
literally it was text fields to type

321
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,020
them in very strange choice I found

322
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:36,010
there's probably a reason behind it I

323
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:38,290
don't know why the instructions are

324
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:41,620
unclear for pretty much anything that is

325
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:44,890
non-native to your infrastructure as far

326
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,950
as bringing in data generally speaking

327
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:50,920
you're mostly worried about syslog type

328
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,380
format or CEF format when bringing in

329
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,319
stuff from outside sources you can

330
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:58,600
muddle through it I did find a good blog

331
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,050
after the fact or a good doc after the

332
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,000
fact about bringing in syslog still

333
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,020
haven't found a very human readable one

334
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,790
for CEF there are instructions out there

335
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:16,920
but again area for improvement for the

336
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,920
engine for the sentinel environment

337
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:23,919
so we've got our data again didn't take

338
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,860
very long at all sorry let me step back

339
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,630
up to Mike did not take very long at all

340
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:31,330
to get our data into the system again

341
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,490
this is excellent they've done a good

342
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,080
job with that so let's talk about alerts

343
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,550
and dashboards because all that data

344
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,199
sitting somewhere does you no good if

345
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:44,409
you're not looking at it and analyzing

346
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:47,980
it so as I mentioned before the so query

347
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:52,660
language is a requirement for analyzing

348
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:54,370
the data and syslog er it is incredibly

349
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:58,420
fast for those of you who haven't used

350
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:00,100
it they say terabytes in seconds

351
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,090
of course that's kind of vague how many

352
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,010
terabytes and how many seconds but it is

353
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:09,220
definitely much faster at running

354
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,540
queries than any other sim that I have

355
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,809
played around with and as I mentioned

356
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:18,750
I've worked with three others one of the

357
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:21,820
functions of kql is that it actually has

358
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:24,730
graphing information along with the data

359
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,409
set so and you can see this when you

360
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,350
play around with it with it when you do

361
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,520
a query there's a tab to graph it the

362
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,250
graphs come up instantly

363
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:37,750
there's no processing time it's quite

364
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:41,230
nice unfortunately you will have to

365
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,910
learn kql to make Sentinel effective at

366
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,580
this point at the way it's set up

367
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,740
there's no getting around having to

368
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,770
learn a new language if you're not

369
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,220
already a kick you I like so expert and

370
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:56,379
to become an expert pretty much every

371
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,090
single document I found including ones

372
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,460
sourced from Microsoft Docs and

373
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:04,260
Microsoft blogs point to Robert Keynes

374
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:07,150
free training up at the Pluralsight

375
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:10,900
website it's a four point five four

376
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,640
point five hour video that covers most

377
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,670
of the commands pretty much everything

378
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,260
that you'll need to use I spent about

379
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,420
three hours of it just kind of playing

380
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,000
around and learning some of it it is a

381
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:25,120
good training tutorial but as far as I

382
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,960
can tell it is the only resource at this

383
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,549
point which is also a

384
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,500
weakness that we have kind of a single

385
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:32,500
point of failure for learning kql

386
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:42,130
so just to give you an idea of how

387
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:46,600
simple it is it is sequel like here's an

388
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:50,980
example of kql this is a fully

389
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:54,010
functional query and if you take a look

390
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,840
at it you can probably pretty quickly

391
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,460
figure out what this is doing I'll give

392
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,780
you guys a couple of seconds did anyone

393
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,440
want to shout out what it looks like

394
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,440
this is doing

395
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:15,780
potential group force detection yep

396
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,669
within a day 15 failed attempts within a

397
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:21,080
four-hour period and this was flat

398
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:26,730
flagon alert right 10 lines of code

399
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:30,030
pretty easy right very useful and human

400
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:32,480
readable which is nice again this should

401
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:37,160
be a fairly easy language for anyone

402
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,160
with development experience to learn

403
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:46,740
so I went out to the github for their

404
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,620
queries and they had one that sounded

405
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:53,130
really interesting tracking privileged

406
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,830
account rare activity again from the

407
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,650
tech community Microsoft comm site I

408
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:05,100
found the link to the code in the github

409
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:07,670
repo for Sentinel and I can't save the

410
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,669
query

411
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:18,200
why because the query was 12,000 173

412
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:20,150
characters and for some reason Sentinel

413
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,370
only allows you to put 10,000 characters

414
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:25,910
in which is a very arbitrary number I

415
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:28,040
don't know any any binary system that

416
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,260
has 10,000 as an important number some I

417
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,149
don't know why but again this is

418
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:37,670
something that is in their get

419
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:40,010
repository to use that is unusable so

420
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:43,490
that was a big fu when I was banging

421
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:46,370
around at it for a while okay so let's

422
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,470
move on let's look at some of the

423
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,449
dashboards this is the overview -

424
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,240
dashboard as soon as you connect up to

425
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:57,140
Sentinel this is the top thing that you

426
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,179
see as you can probably tell I've got

427
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:05,120
one alert that was logged in that time

428
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:08,750
period out of 400 53,000 signals that

429
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,879
came through pretty straightforward

430
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,830
down in the bottom right it's saying

431
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,440
data source anomalies this is just

432
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,210
looking at the telemetry and looking for

433
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,620
changes if you've ever used something

434
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:23,510
like PRTG they've got a lot of these

435
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,189
monitors on there as well just saying

436
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,200
hey this isn't what it normally is it

437
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,020
doesn't really do any analysis on it it

438
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,740
just says hey this is different maybe

439
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,740
take a peak out

440
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,540
the incident dashboard so I clicked on

441
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,310
that incident pretty nice it prioritized

442
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,399
it based on the rule set that I put in

443
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:46,870
there it's a medium priority I flagged

444
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,610
it as in process assigned it to a person

445
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:52,010
great okay so now they've got a ticket

446
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,740
and down in the bottom right there's a

447
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,970
blue button that you can see that says

448
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,620
investigate so hmm

449
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,500
I need to investigate the investigation

450
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,659
button that is supposed to bring up the

451
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,320
incident of the investigation dashboard

452
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:08,270
which the video that they show is

453
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,090
beautiful this beautiful graphing with

454
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:15,520
animations showing you how all the data

455
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,520
flows for this particular incident

456
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:29,730
coming soon so again it's some preview

457
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:32,400
acceptable there is a link to join the

458
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:35,520
super exclusive club of testers of this

459
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,510
down at the bottom of the page did not

460
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,980
have time to do that but this looks like

461
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:43,560
some really nice secret sauce that

462
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,960
they're adding to the sim that

463
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,210
unfortunately is not available to the

464
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,730
public yet I look forward to seeing

465
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:52,640
where this goes and how it works in the

466
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:56,009
incident investigation process

467
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,009
[Music]

468
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,070
so a couple more dashboards real quick

469
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,250
Active Directory sign-ins you know it's

470
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,678
gonna show you what's signing and where

471
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:11,610
is so on and so forth sign ins by

472
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:14,190
application sign ins by locations failed

473
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:16,290
sign ins by user failed sign ins by

474
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:20,120
location which is really nice when you

475
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:25,830
see that China has 37 failed logins and

476
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:28,709
Russia has 8 ok so that includes my

477
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,270
office 365 instance everything my

478
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,400
Outlook instance obviously there are

479
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,799
people poking and prodding at at the

480
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,760
perimeter I can see that easily in my

481
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,760
dashboard right here

482
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:52,039
I don't know for that particular graph

483
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:55,000
because excuse me I'm sorry would you

484
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,000
repeat the question real quick

485
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:16,289
got it so the question is does it

486
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:18,809
require p1 or p2 and office 365 or can

487
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:22,350
you use the basic and the answer is I

488
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:26,610
don't know we are an e3 environment

489
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:31,289
ourselves so I don't know the details on

490
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:32,758
different versions of office 365 at this

491
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:36,210
point again this is just kind of my

492
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:39,179
first dive into it I am NOT an expert on

493
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:41,070
Sentinel I'm just presenting my findings

494
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,389
so I guess that and from a bit of

495
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,490
information helps of what our

496
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:48,350
environment looks like it is in those

497
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,350
365 III environment

498
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:58,250
p2 or p3 Eric sorry or p2 III or p2 is

499
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:01,550
what I'm hearing

500
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,550
thank you Frank

501
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:08,450
identity and access we can see failed

502
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:10,970
user logins by reason machine logins by

503
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:14,119
type again all of these dashboards are

504
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,669
pre-built running as soon as the product

505
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,499
is running obviously from the moment

506
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:20,749
that you have those data sources to when

507
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:25,549
the graphs start getting filled takes a

508
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:29,409
little bit of time I think I saw most of

509
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,408
them having data within an hour

510
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,649
is their ability to enrich data from

511
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:43,129
Intel sources as in threat intelligence

512
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:45,918
yes there is there is quite the robust

513
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:47,299
threat intelligence scheme I wasn't

514
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,370
going to be covering that in this talk

515
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:51,710
but yes there is a way to bring in

516
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,508
threat intelligence sources using one of

517
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,399
the standard formats I can't remember

518
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,539
which one it is off the top my head but

519
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:00,350
I'll put it in the notes for when I

520
00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:02,960
publish this ok cool

521
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:08,389
identity and access I already covered

522
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:11,149
that office 365 folder changes and final

523
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:15,439
changes this is obviously good for when

524
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:18,979
you're doing things like DLP sharepoint

525
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,600
onedrive top client IP addresses I've

526
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,240
rented those out because a lot of those

527
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,418
are internal IP addresses to us users

528
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,759
who download the largest number of files

529
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:30,500
so again if you see you know all of a

530
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,080
sudden one of your people who you know

531
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,570
is leaving is downloading everything

532
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,850
you've got it right there again built-in

533
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,960
dashboard

534
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,928
[Music]

535
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,360
active DNS servers this one was a head

536
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:46,880
scratcher for me I've got four DNS

537
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,240
servers in here and it's only showing my

538
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,780
PDC I don't know if this is something

539
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,100
that they've done intentionally to limit

540
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,990
it saying hey you really are only

541
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,719
running one domain in this particular

542
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:02,330
instance would make sense if that's the

543
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,730
case I didn't bring a second domain in

544
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,919
to see if it would show that but my

545
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,050
assumption is it's basically going to

546
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,200
just show one domain controller per

547
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,200
domain

548
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:20,899
and then as your network watcher traffic

549
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:24,110
flow types this one was very interesting

550
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,240
to me so if you look down at the bottom

551
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:32,179
it's telling me I had a hundred

552
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:34,370
thirty-eight malicious flows that that

553
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,440
raised some alarms for me right away

554
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:38,709
right okay what are these malicious

555
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,710
flows

556
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,870
so these are all the sub forms on that

557
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,870
table

558
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:59,010
I got nothing zero insights it's telling

559
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:59,010
me I have malicious flows

560
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,350
but no data

561
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,770
okay so I bring up the graph and again I

562
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:22,540
see that 1.2 percent of all of my

563
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:26,560
network traffic is being flagged as

564
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:29,040
malicious by sentinel this is highly

565
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,040
concerning

566
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:35,210
but no data why do you hate me Microsoft

567
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:35,209
you give me panic attacks

568
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:44,160
so we've got again some decent decent

569
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:46,610
built-in dashboards you can create all

570
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:50,190
of your own custom dashboards as well

571
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:52,379
and again in their github repository

572
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:57,150
there are more available in JSON file

573
00:29:52,380 --> 00:30:03,420
format to bring in but you will need to

574
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:07,680
know Stoke to bring stuff in properly it

575
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:10,470
is not terribly complicated it's not

576
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,480
like writing Python but for a

577
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,010
drag-and-drop it's pretty complicated to

578
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,470
create your own but it is doable

579
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,540
I made some simple ones in a few minutes

580
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:22,230
but trying to bring in multiple sources

581
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:24,690
of telemetry wound up becoming a project

582
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,460
that was bigger than was required for

583
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,410
this presentation

584
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:31,080
just know that dashboards can be

585
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,610
incredibly complicated but you'll have

586
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,460
to put a lot of work in to make them so

587
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,389
they're pretty rich and the fly excuse

588
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,480
me

589
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:41,430
they are pretty rich but again the more

590
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,170
level detail you want takes a lot of

591
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,600
effort

592
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:49,560
so we're gonna talk about playbooks now

593
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:55,350
what are playbooks has anyone here ever

594
00:30:49,560 --> 00:31:00,570
used excuse me I heard something when

595
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:02,850
the audience it is basically flow yes so

596
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:05,370
Microsoft used to have a slogan where do

597
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,750
you want to go today I propose that they

598
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:09,020
change it to what do you want to call it

599
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,020
today

600
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:16,080
it's crazy folks stick with a name I how

601
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:20,460
many times has a Skype for business been

602
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,629
renamed you know link now that's going

603
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,620
away to teams

604
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:27,090
yeah so anyway it doesn't help things

605
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,189
when the names are changing consoles

606
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:33,990
constantly as you can see it is

607
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:36,530
essentially flows which makes it one of

608
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:42,230
the really impressive aspects of

609
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:45,899
centinall you can easily create

610
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:49,530
workflows in Sentinel if you've had any

611
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:52,710
experience with flows even if you

612
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,000
haven't here's a quick video hopefully

613
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,920
you'll be able to see it I'll kind of

614
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,840
narrate it as it goes so I just did a

615
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,450
search for zarur and it's basically says

616
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,629
on any is your event and I click Next

617
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:06,720
and I'm gonna say open up and post

618
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,520
something in teams so you can select

619
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,990
your team's channel I don't go into all

620
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,270
the details here but just showing you

621
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:15,330
how rapidly you can build a workflow

622
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:18,150
that once a specific type of event is

623
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:21,080
detected you can have all kinds of

624
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:25,260
processing happen automatically

625
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:28,590
including approvals and cancellations

626
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,590
and escalations and all different kinds

627
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:34,500
of systems because flows works with

628
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:37,290
pretty much every vendor I've ever heard

629
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,170
of as far as you know being able to

630
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,770
interface so here once I get the team's

631
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:44,400
thing in I believe I have it next

632
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,040
simultaneously and that's the great

633
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,890
things you can have forking workflows

634
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:52,730
post a ticket into JIRA so we'll be done

635
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,730
here in a second

636
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,960
people

637
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:14,270
I promise this is fast oh sorry I'm

638
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,370
having it created an approval message in

639
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:19,889
Outlook which then you could again have

640
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:22,049
it not go forward until whoever is

641
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:24,900
assigned to be able to approve it to

642
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:28,370
make it go forward again it's really

643
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:31,970
slick to have this built into your sim

644
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:34,830
and again because it is a long-standing

645
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,630
Microsoft product a lot of you will have

646
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,610
experience with it already and aren't

647
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:41,480
going to have to learn a whole new way

648
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,479
to set up workflows

649
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:49,500
mmm-hmm just go ahead and skip the rest

650
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,750
of the video for times sake but yes you

651
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,960
can fork and bring processes back

652
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,960
together

653
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,439
logic apps designer so this is if you

654
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,150
want to do those workflows from a pure

655
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,360
coding base for you code monkeys out

656
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:13,590
there again the github community

657
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:15,668
repository has one playbook and github

658
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,919
thought that was interesting that there

659
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:20,109
is one in there but hey it sounds really

660
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,870
cool it's get the geographic information

661
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:25,270
from an IP and tag the incident on a map

662
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:28,779
I was like excellent this will really

663
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:30,310
slick one to go through and test so it

664
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,750
down at the bottom it's like about hey

665
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:35,399
here's how you do it it's this simple

666
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,399
copy and paste your code in right

667
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:42,759
we got another goat and again this is

668
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,980
direct from their source code and I get

669
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,410
a save logic app fill malicious attacks

670
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:51,480
is just what I was test calling the the

671
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:55,178
workflow got nowhere with the one

672
00:34:51,480 --> 00:35:00,160
workflow that they had coded obviously

673
00:34:55,179 --> 00:35:02,620
this is again a preview so hopefully

674
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,560
this will get a lot of love here in the

675
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:08,470
not-too-distant future so that if you're

676
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,750
wanting to do things outside of the GUI

677
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,640
if you do I'd like to do a lot of

678
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,980
scripting you should be able to do it

679
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,379
through scripting I am no longer a code

680
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:21,640
monkey so I wasn't gonna bother trying

681
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:24,610
to troubleshoot this so again it is

682
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,529
essentially flow and it has way more

683
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:29,470
connectors than the data connectors

684
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,840
again this is a mature Microsoft product

685
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:34,899
that they have rolled into Sentinel

686
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:37,480
where is whereas the data connectors are

687
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,120
something new to Sentinel because that

688
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,830
is you know how Sentinel got created

689
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,100
right by bringing these data connectors

690
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:46,930
and hopefully we'll see a lot more data

691
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,890
connectors in the future so that it

692
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,890
works a lot more like float

693
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:59,839
workbooks so workbooks as I mentioned

694
00:35:56,509 --> 00:36:04,849
use Jupiter bad joke

695
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:07,849
okay so workbooks as a free hosting

696
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:09,980
service of Jupiter notebooks it's open

697
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:12,559
source web documentation that contains

698
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,849
code of which there are 40 different

699
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,430
languages I would see the big ones that

700
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:19,730
you know Python is the flavor of the

701
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:22,730
decade so you can create all kinds of

702
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,619
application scripts without having to

703
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,569
have a hosting environment because you

704
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:29,989
just write it into this free service

705
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:31,759
using Jupiter notebooks which obviously

706
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:37,309
since you're doing full-on programming

707
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:42,049
you can have absolutely gorgeous ways to

708
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:44,809
program your logic outside of the

709
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:47,420
Sentinel system again I am NOT a code

710
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:49,369
monkey I did not dive into this a lot I

711
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,400
do know a little bit of Python I got a

712
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:55,759
quick basic Python script running and

713
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,400
had no problems whatsoever this is also

714
00:36:55,759 --> 00:37:01,789
a way to bring in everything that is in

715
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,589
the is your Sentinel git repository you

716
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:05,630
so you can take the JSON scripts that

717
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:08,480
are out there and bring them in the

718
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:10,819
jupiter notebooks right which is a nice

719
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,829
feature instead of doing copypasta all

720
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:14,900
the time you can have your subscription

721
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:18,049
to it and just run it in a notebook so

722
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:20,749
that when the the git repository changes

723
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:25,640
or you do pull change it and just run it

724
00:37:20,749 --> 00:37:28,669
in your notebook so again

725
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,440
I'm not quite sure how old Jupiter is it

726
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:32,869
seems to be a pretty decent standard a

727
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,910
lot of people have adopted it I was

728
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:37,130
pleasantly surprised at how well this

729
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:39,710
worked considering it was an external

730
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:41,660
interface especially considering how the

731
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:44,710
other external interfaces were working

732
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,710
with Sentinel

733
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:50,850
and last machine learning

734
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:59,069
I can't sorry it's in there

735
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:01,650
my only evidence of machine learning

736
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:03,480
that I saw my whole time using it was

737
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:09,650
actually running the PowerShell script

738
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:13,590
to enable machine learning that's it so

739
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:15,840
the the they have videos up on their

740
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,790
website showing it detecting anomalous

741
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,350
events and popping it up and clicking on

742
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,660
it and getting the graph to see where

743
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:24,630
everything came from and my test

744
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:29,490
environment here I got none of that over

745
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:31,860
the course of two months now is that

746
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:35,040
saying it's not there and not working

747
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:38,310
and not effective no but there was no

748
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:43,340
signal whatsoever to tell me that it was

749
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:46,140
working right it would be nice to see

750
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:48,390
even the fact that hey we found all

751
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,170
these false positives or something like

752
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:51,180
that

753
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:54,270
there was no insight to it my

754
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:56,040
understanding is again using kql you can

755
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,560
do some deep dives into the machine

756
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,050
learning aspects of it you can subscribe

757
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,700
to a service that allows you to actually

758
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,900
customize the machine learning on it but

759
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,730
again that's kind of outside of the

760
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:15,270
scope of this touch this first look into

761
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:17,340
sentinel but as someone who you'd sat

762
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,440
there and used it for two months I did

763
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,330
not see a single example of what they

764
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,120
demonstrate on their video training

765
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:25,880
videos

766
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,759
uh may mean I have a fairly clean

767
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,360
environment but again 1.7 percent of my

768
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,220
traffic is supposed to be malicious why

769
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:39,380
am I not seeing any machine learning on

770
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:40,879
that so is this just again the fact

771
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,970
that's a preview release and they don't

772
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,860
have all the hooks in right now is this

773
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:49,580
just the nature of my environment it's a

774
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:52,940
bad test environment for that that's it

775
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:55,670
I don't know the answer to that I wish I

776
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:58,580
had some really sexy machine learning

777
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,080
things to talk about but I don't which

778
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,000
is something in and of itself I think

779
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,690
that you know reporting a negative is

780
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,910
just as important that I did not see any

781
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:10,370
any indications that machine learning

782
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:12,470
was running in my environment other than

783
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:15,170
again when I went back to double-check

784
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,970
to make sure that you know I used a

785
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,580
PowerShell to turn the service off and

786
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:24,819
back on again and got positive messages

787
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,819
from them okay it's running so

788
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,400
that's pretty much it for my initial

789
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,230
dive as I said I was in there for about

790
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,640
two months

791
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:38,430
I saw a lot of really cool new things

792
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,400
saw a lot of really bad old things and a

793
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:43,190
few head scratchers but overall for a

794
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,740
preview release I was pretty impressed

795
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:50,400
that this is something that could be an

796
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:53,399
effective tool especially with proper

797
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,160
pricing and I'm gonna talk from my

798
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:00,990
standpoint working at a SMB a small

799
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:02,640
medium size business it is looks like it

800
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:06,029
could be something that would be a very

801
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,500
effective solution for my organization I

802
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:12,690
just want to make sure we have time for

803
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:16,170
questions so again it is so Microsoft

804
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:19,620
that the mission the mature aspects of

805
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:21,000
it are excellent they've taken their

806
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,029
lumps they've learned their lessons

807
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,900
they've streamlined it made it

808
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:31,770
ridiculously easy but the new things are

809
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,960
quite kludgy they still don't really

810
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:38,730
play well with all things Linux even

811
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,590
though they require it so again nothing

812
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:46,200
that you haven't seen already as far as

813
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:50,650
Microsoft goes on that as your ATP who

814
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:54,430
here uses as your ATP what do you think

815
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:58,140
I think it's phenomenal I think it has

816
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,140
become one of their better products

817
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:05,049
there's a data link to it there is no

818
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:07,538
built-in dashboard for it if I want any

819
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:10,749
of my ATP data I wind up having to go

820
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:12,910
back to ATP it's not in my seam the

821
00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:14,828
whole point of the seam sim is to

822
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:18,308
aggregate aggregate everything and give

823
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:20,079
it to me there is the one data source

824
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:22,150
that I hooked in that it didn't say hey

825
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,859
we have a control panel for that you

826
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,589
want it yes please

827
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:29,890
so please please please bring that in

828
00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:33,119
because that is an excellent source of

829
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,118
information and threat hunting

830
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:39,500
again more detections prepackaged and

831
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:41,450
make them prepackaged I should say there

832
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,850
are quite a few out there and their

833
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:44,859
github repository that you can load in

834
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:48,259
yourself

835
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:49,670
why aren't they there to begin with why

836
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,260
do I have to go out to get hub to get

837
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,660
them some of them are just basic things

838
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,210
that you know every sim wants to see

839
00:42:53,660 --> 00:43:01,100
have them built in and able to enable

840
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:02,930
them right off the bat tie it into

841
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,700
compliance frameworks and this is

842
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,109
probably just because I'm a director oh

843
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,540
my gosh

844
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:11,750
you've got all these searches available

845
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:15,770
that are directly related to controls in

846
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:18,320
CIS and ISO and a cybersecurity

847
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:20,930
framework 1.2 whatever

848
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,890
why not cross-reference them somehow

849
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:28,339
give yourself a scorecard it's not in

850
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:29,690
there it should I would say that every

851
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:34,580
symbol should have that but that's my

852
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:39,119
opinion a big use on the top four is for

853
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:41,969
compliance reasons make it easier for us

854
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,039
and again if they're wanting to be the

855
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:50,849
small business it needs to be easier

856
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:52,739
right I like the fact that I can go in

857
00:43:50,849 --> 00:44:00,630
and set up and bring my data sources in

858
00:43:52,739 --> 00:44:01,920
a lot faster but flies back kql is gonna

859
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,989
have a learning curve for any

860
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,269
organization especially a small business

861
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:09,660
they're not gonna have the resources to

862
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:13,109
dedicate to pay someone to be a kql

863
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:15,739
programmer period yet it is at this

864
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:22,259
point a requirement to run this product

865
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:24,900
I would like to see that change for us

866
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:26,700
for us to be able to adopt us into a

867
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,819
standard product into our production

868
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,819
environment

869
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,379
you'd step back to the detections there

870
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,150
aren't you know everyone when they set

871
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,490
up a sim they're looking for a buffer

872
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:45,869
overflow events looking for ping sweeps

873
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:48,180
port scans Who am I you know no one's

874
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:50,190
running Who am I except for someone

875
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,680
trying to exploit your stuff right and

876
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,089
even if it is one of your sis admin's

877
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:58,078
running it for whatever reason

878
00:44:54,089 --> 00:45:01,380
again using flows I can say is this one

879
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,839
of them okay I've got duo hit them on

880
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,940
second factor say hey did you just do

881
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,819
this and if they don't respond via duo

882
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:12,599
and do a second factor automatically

883
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:15,119
start an incident on this if they if

884
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:18,180
they do respond to it then close it out

885
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,309
again these kind of things would be easy

886
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,470
to put in except for the fact that I'm

887
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:25,859
just I'm gonna name a name here with duo

888
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:28,049
duo interfaces with the juror but I've

889
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:30,710
got no way to interface it with Sentinel

890
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:33,869
at this point you're already partnering

891
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:36,900
let's let's let's get this really good

892
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:41,400
product that works well with the rest of

893
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:43,319
the juror to bring it into our flows and

894
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,710
defender excuse me in not in defender

895
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,710
and Sentinel

896
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:52,240
again machine learning give indications

897
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:54,819
of it functioning to those of us who are

898
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,029
not machine learning people if you're

899
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:00,730
planning if the whole industry is

900
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:03,280
planning on having their sims work in a

901
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:06,400
way that a lot of the background stuff

902
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,720
and low-hanging fruit and false positive

903
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,740
identifying is going to be done by

904
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:13,779
machine learning show me I need to know

905
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:16,919
otherwise why am i paying the extra for

906
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,920
the machine learning right

907
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:23,809
so just a few final thoughts real quick

908
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:25,549
not related to this III I do love

909
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:26,779
Microsoft I really do I have made

910
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,759
hundreds of thousands of dollars

911
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:32,660
supporting him over the years Thank You

912
00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:34,519
Microsoft I I do like your products this

913
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,460
I hope wasn't too much of a bashing

914
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:40,848
session this was just me trying to show

915
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:43,130
what it's like as someone who posts a

916
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:46,660
lot of systems over the years what got

917
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,660
what went right what did not go right

918
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,900
be kind to each other everyone you don't

919
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,829
know what everyone's going through on a

920
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,960
daily basis

921
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:59,130
and lastly lift while you climb right

922
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,930
make sure that you're always mentoring

923
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,220
make sure that you're always helping out

924
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:03,720
people who are less fortunate than you

925
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:07,680
this is personal

926
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:09,808
okay so I'm gonna open up the questions

927
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,339
but before we do I'd like to introduce

928
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:13,920
you I don't know how many of you are

929
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:15,990
into go to the sci-fi cons at all or

930
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,559
have ever heard John Scalzi

931
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:21,598
talk but he has the Scalzi rules what is

932
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:23,819
the question contain it contains a

933
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,609
question how many parts that have

934
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:33,269
question one and how long is it

935
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:37,200
it's a tweet okay so we've got about

936
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:39,649
probably five minutes for questions see

937
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,649
one over here

938
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,750
yes it does did not hook it in because

939
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,610
we're not running defendant we don't

940
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,610
have a test environment for defender ATP

941
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,450
more questions right here

942
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:02,410
so that was the whole thing

943
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:04,990
I very much was trying to do this on my

944
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:06,910
own I did have one interaction with my

945
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:10,359
support rep and that was regarding the

946
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:14,098
documentation on sis mom because the

947
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:18,549
logger the log integration for events

948
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:21,579
that I use was bringing in sis Mon rules

949
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:24,369
as well and because I wasn't seeing them

950
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:26,560
in I called up my representative to say

951
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:27,550
hey is this working or not am I not

952
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,750
doing this right where's the

953
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:31,180
documentation on that and they're the

954
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:33,520
ones who pointed me to the doc so yes

955
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:36,098
but I tried to do it with minimal asking

956
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,079
because again small business doesn't

957
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:41,800
always have the money for support right

958
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:44,050
so this was trying to just go in as a

959
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,089
veteran to see what we can do right off

960
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:48,240
the bat

961
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,240
go ahead

962
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:57,200
new instances do they need any setup

963
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:59,180
what kind of instance so if you're

964
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,259
adding it to something that is already

965
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:05,870
if so the way log analytics works is

966
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:09,380
pretty much everything that you do and

967
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:11,810
as your is going into log analytics or

968
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,650
you can tell it to write any object that

969
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:15,440
you put in there

970
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:17,690
you can set up a log analytics you can

971
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,730
have hundreds of long analytics

972
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:21,350
instances if you want to but for this

973
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,510
you're setting up a specific one and the

974
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:25,130
good thing is every object every server

975
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:28,310
I can have going to multiple log

976
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:30,800
analytics so if you do create a new VM

977
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:34,820
or if you have a new SAS or whatever in

978
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,920
there all you have to do is literally go

979
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,260
in and tell it to log to that log

980
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,780
analytics instance so it's it's not

981
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,550
automatic but it's close enough when

982
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:45,130
you're building it you tell it where you

983
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,760
want it to log

984
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,760
go ahead

985
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:57,980
