1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,230
avy ready awesome

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:17,130
so now be on the Internet and I'll be

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:18,570
famous already if you hear for there's

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:26,549
no place like dual home you're in the

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:28,800
right talk if not please stay so as

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,149
tight says it talks about there's no

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,730
place like dual home start out with who

8
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,329
is David Young junior worked in the IT

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:42,480
industry for twenty three years last in

10
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:46,079
ten and security I've worked health care

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,949
government financial utility all those

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,660
fun places a very amateur lock-picker

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:56,190
I'm an avid gamer PC master-race

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:02,550
console sucks I like nerdcore rap

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:07,350
dubstep into anime not the technical

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,298
stuff and Gundam models that's me

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,408
picture my wife I just appointed the era

18
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,290
to make sure you can understand that's

19
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,700
me I'm not the other one great I got

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,490
hecklers in the front it's gonna be

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,439
wonderful

22
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:26,610
so talking points for this is of course

23
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:29,970
what's a dual homed system why would we

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,740
use a dual homed system know how to

25
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,140
order the demos actually at the end I

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,630
have a video demo of me using this in

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,079
order to actually go we'll say two

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:44,310
subnets deep into an environment to get

29
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:47,039
the goodies as they say and that's what

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,290
the but wait there's more and discuss a

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,780
little bit of mitigations on your

32
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,070
network how to prevent this and some

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,780
other things around that and then of

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,779
course take any questions you have so

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,350
what is a dual homed system now of

36
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,540
course the standard definition is a

37
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,119
system that has more than one network

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,030
interface now generally this was used

39
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,239
especially on network devices and

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,440
servers so that if you had a failure and

41
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,960
one network interface the

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,590
second one could pick up or take over

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,760
sometimes in the network devices it's

44
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,180
shotgunning so if you want to do

45
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,480
increased speed across a network if you

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,250
have two sources coming in like that but

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,280
on a Windows system what's interesting

48
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,770
is you can assign of course one IP

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,230
subnet to one interface and the second

50
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:40,260
IP subnet to another interface and it

51
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:46,890
kind of almost acts like we'll say a

52
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:48,690
makeshift router or switch here's a

53
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,309
little graphic I found it's it's the

54
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,840
best one because the one I drew in paint

55
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,310
was really horrible so I felt this was a

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,980
little better back in the day back and

57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,420
way back in the day I actually did

58
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,820
something similar to this with my

59
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,559
internet cable connection using black

60
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:09,870
ice defender internet connection sharing

61
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,820
I had a 386 compact computer and at

62
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,530
cable connection coming on one side and

63
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,780
using internet connection sharing share

64
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,700
out all my devices on my home network

65
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:24,989
which is about a whole two devices at

66
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:28,140
that time so so why would somebody do

67
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:31,800
this now this was also a question I kind

68
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,299
of asked myself when I ran into this now

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,860
previously as I mentioned in the

70
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,290
definition of a dual home a lot of it

71
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,150
was for redundancy was the original

72
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,150
thought you know you one interface goes

73
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,920
down that web server can't be offline so

74
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,470
we've got another interface there and

75
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,049
through routing and and run either

76
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,380
round-robin or bandwidth sharing you can

77
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,239
keep those systems up and alive like I

78
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,760
said on a Windows system though it found

79
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:02,160
people found out you can create a second

80
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:05,010
subnet using this so now you can have a

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,760
lab a dev a whole different network

82
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,220
environment with minimal costs I mean

83
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,459
nowadays what's a network card a couple

84
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,168
bucks at best so don't have to spend all

85
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,390
this money just set up this whole big

86
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,640
environment that can just throw in

87
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,988
another network card say okay these are

88
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,760
all going to be a different subnet and

89
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,760
everything's hooked in behind that and

90
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,430
as I say on the bottom it's one of the

91
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:32,520
big issues is it makes it easier for the

92
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,710
users to bypass complicated policies and

93
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,740
procedures and the whole budgeting issue

94
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,799
- I need a lab we don't have the budget

95
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,039
for that I got ten dollars we can fix

96
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,039
that

97
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:51,690
so kind of on discovering a dual home

98
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,159
system is kind of obvious but you know

99
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,860
not if you've ever been on the system

100
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:59,550
and you do an IP config you all sudden

101
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,800
got ethanol and epinet one and two

102
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:06,719
different IP addresses on there and

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,990
again in the scenario I was involved in

104
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:11,520
when I found this I'm like well you know

105
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,800
again the question is why why are they

106
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,818
doing this and and what's behind the

107
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,949
magic curtain of course being a hacker

108
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:26,610
and when hackers get curious it kind of

109
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:29,430
gets dangerous so now you've compromised

110
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,069
this system that's dual home is there

111
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,289
anything behind it there are various

112
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:36,180
methods I know a lot of the

113
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:38,568
documentation out there say use it as a

114
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,699
pivot we're going to pivot through it

115
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:44,190
that works I found some of the tools are

116
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:47,759
really finicky about working through a

117
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:51,180
pivot or a proxy if you set up the proxy

118
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,819
chains they will work I just had some

119
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:58,500
weird you know inconsistencies with them

120
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:00,120
now you can use it as a pivot to do some

121
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,029
maybe initial ping sweeps and find if

122
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,840
there's more behind it also to within a

123
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:07,800
window system you can just do an arc a

124
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,258
people tell you everybody that it's

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,060
talked to and then you can kind of find

126
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:16,199
some sources behind there that it's talk

127
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:19,500
to that's kind of in the bottom half of

128
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:23,789
the screen shot you can see the ten ten

129
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:28,770
fifty ten now the original IP is a one

130
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:30,750
92168 20.5 on the device but you can see

131
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,628
it's talked to a 10 10 50 10 so you're

132
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:37,660
like oh well there's something out there

133
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:40,400
I want to believe

134
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,960
so how can you get to these dual home

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,169
systems like I said you could use the

136
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,719
proxy pivot it's it can be slow there's

137
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:52,100
some issues end up does some weird

138
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,800
things too when you use proxy chains so

139
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,570
doing some research now fortunately have

140
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,180
a license for cobalt strike I don't know

141
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:02,690
if you're familiar with cobalt strike

142
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:04,550
Rafael mud is his name it's a wonderful

143
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:07,010
tool especially if you have a team for

144
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,740
collaborating you can all see the

145
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:13,400
targets you can see who's on what and

146
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:18,710
using different tools and no this is not

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,599
a paid sponsorship but so essentially on

148
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,780
one of his blogs he talked about he had

149
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,919
named SMB named pipes and with that you

150
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,729
can use it to tunnel through to other

151
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:32,690
targets so then now we're going to get

152
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:34,130
into what is an SMB named pipe so named

153
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,750
pipes as it says there and I'm gonna try

154
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,060
not to read too much are similar to to

155
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,230
see open GC people works with a client

156
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,360
could connect to the server must only

157
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:47,750
given port a lot of times it's based on

158
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:49,280
SMB and you set up a port on the machine

159
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,010
you've already compromised and you say

160
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,719
hey let's talk through that via SMB to

161
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:58,010
the other side and what's wonderful

162
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,510
about Windows is Windows loves SMB and a

163
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,090
lot of the firewalls you're running to

164
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,169
they're going to block all those odd

165
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,630
command control channels to get out

166
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,969
there so I'm going to do HTTP well we

167
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,020
don't allow that traffic HTTP we don't

168
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,460
allow that track there's no need for

169
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,919
that traffic to be going in between

170
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,969
those areas it shouldn't be happening

171
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,859
and this is the only if you're dealing

172
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,540
with a firewall and even on the Windows

173
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:23,120
Firewall you can kind of run into those

174
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:25,280
issues also setting up an SMB name pipe

175
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,250
raises a lot less flags with your with

176
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,859
the blue team's I mean I'm not sure how

177
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,520
many blue teams out there can say

178
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,270
looking in all their logs

179
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,228
that's hot SMB traffic there's a lot of

180
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,880
that going on out there if you have

181
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:40,280
windows in the environment makes it very

182
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,760
difficult now obviously if you're in an

183
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:46,100
area or a zone where a lot of SMB

184
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,900
traffic doesn't happen like you know

185
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,820
your web DMZ and all they know is web

186
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,270
traffic's supposed to be there that may

187
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,360
trace

188
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:56,090
flags but if you're on a normal Network

189
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,110
compromising a system it's very helpful

190
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,190
to hide within the chatter as they say

191
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,020
[Music]

192
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,390
and as I said a lot of the networks they

193
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,790
may block other ports that you try to

194
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,020
use but SMB if it's Windows and they

195
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,099
want Windows to talk to Windows that

196
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,270
will usually always be open

197
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:18,950
unfortunately yep

198
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,720
fill out or I apologize so but wait

199
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,000
there's more as I said so digging around

200
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,320
I I was able to compromise a system

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,860
we're not really going to talk about

202
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,420
that

203
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:32,120
eternally once I got on that system

204
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,670
found it was dual homed was able to hop

205
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,070
through it poke around in this

206
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:40,550
additional subnet found another device

207
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:43,040
that was yet dual homed again and I went

208
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,790
well I wonder if this would work going

209
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,939
even deeper and it did I was able to hop

210
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:52,040
essentially three subnets deep in order

211
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,050
to get all the goodies now the

212
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,880
unfortunate part for them was that there

213
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,420
was a challenge thrown down you'll never

214
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:03,410
find our QA dev environment you'll never

215
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:06,469
get in there no give me a little bit so

216
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:09,170
that was kind of interesting was able

217
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,850
being able to use cobalt strike to

218
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,610
essentially hop through three subnets

219
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,780
through SMB name pipe in order to get

220
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,260
into those networks that they said we'd

221
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,069
never be able to find or get into

222
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,780
essentially this is what it looks like

223
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:25,070
when you do the visual view and cobalt

224
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:27,230
strike the user a or the initial box

225
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:30,860
there the the PC box a was the initial

226
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,620
compromise that's the box we got on we

227
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:37,670
find that that one's dual homed so we

228
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:41,900
set up the SMB named pipe and we're able

229
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:44,360
to get on PC box B and now of course

230
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,600
after you user a we elevated the system

231
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,370
when we PS exec across there SMB we get

232
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,959
a system account on PC box B

233
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,160
and then from that one that is dual home

234
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,768
we're able to ask them set up an SMB

235
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,300
name piped on that one and hop even

236
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:06,269
further in to what I'm calling PC box C

237
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:09,839
and then once you get on C you have full

238
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:11,939
control and interactive on C but you're

239
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,709
not directly going from the attacker box

240
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:16,019
all the way out there like you see in

241
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:17,550
some diagrams when people do this you're

242
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:26,639
actually hopping through two other boxes

243
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:28,979
to get there hmm

244
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,949
so that duplicate slides I think I did I

245
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,569
apologize for that

246
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:41,519
so I do have a demo video of me setting

247
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:44,849
this up we'll go back on that just

248
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:49,050
second what kind of talk through the

249
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:58,529
video a little bit is it then let me huh

250
00:11:49,050 --> 00:12:13,410
I broke it they'll lose video because I

251
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:22,410
switched thank you you're you're also

252
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:28,499
helpful there we go I turned it off and

253
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:30,870
on again so right now before I start the

254
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:33,389
video what has happened is at the very

255
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,959
top is the initial compromise of PC box

256
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:39,360
a and then from there I made sure that I

257
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,559
had I did a git system I made sure that

258
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,179
I was elevated before I moved on for PC

259
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,040
box a because it's always nicer to work

260
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:55,529
as a system level account than a

261
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:57,420
standard user so through our pay I

262
00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:00,170
already discovered the other IP as I was

263
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:08,459
saying the 10 10 50 10

264
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:13,050
so I set it up as a target and then IPS

265
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:17,520
exec across to it using the name pipe

266
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:18,810
that I had set up on PC box a now

267
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,990
unfortunately I didn't show that but I

268
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:28,859
will show that in a second now as you

269
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:32,750
can see it's not that I was able to go

270
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:37,070
from PC box a via the SMB named pipe

271
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:39,720
listener and cobalt strike to PC box B

272
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,670
now I'm not sure if anybody familiar

273
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,400
with that cold strike has a lot of nice

274
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:48,510
built-in tools from there you're able to

275
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:51,420
dump hashes run me me cats get all the

276
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:54,360
goodies and user logins now another

277
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,870
failure on this part was password and

278
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,750
account reuse they had same accounts on

279
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,760
one system that they were using on these

280
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,470
internal networks across the board and

281
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:12,480
we were able to take advantage of that

282
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:15,420
also so then what's interesting too is

283
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,470
if you look at the interfaces on PC box

284
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,089
a or PC box be the external gives one IP

285
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,490
the internal gives a different IP and

286
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,140
this was also Q but fortunate because we

287
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:28,620
were using COBOL strike gave me a cue as

288
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,850
I'm on another dual home system alright

289
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,230
so what we're going to do from here I

290
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:37,230
said well there must be something on

291
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:39,090
that 170 to 1650 range so I start

292
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,380
interacting when I well first thing you

293
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:44,420
know first thing you're always do is

294
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:47,030
dump the hashes and we run maybe cats

295
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:53,819
just want all the things from there

296
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:56,069
drink all the booze and as you can see

297
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,410
it's all the hashes we've got at that

298
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,700
point of time now if you're really

299
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,380
fortunate hopefully they haven't applied

300
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,360
the W digest pass and you get some plain

301
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,020
text ones that makes your life a lot

302
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,020
easier from there

303
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,339
so then I'm just going to show okay well

304
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,360
let me run an IP config normal

305
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:15,250
reconnaissance I would do a lot more

306
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,220
than that but for this demo I'm just

307
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:21,100
doing okay I see the second interface

308
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,560
with an IP on there all right well has

309
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:29,110
this talked to anything let's run art -

310
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:33,339
eh why yes it has there's a 172 1650 dot

311
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:35,200
10 now admittedly in the actual use case

312
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,940
where this happened that art table was

313
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,620
huge there are many other devices that

314
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:43,959
had talked to so I'll go okay so then we

315
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:48,550
set up within cobalt strike we set that

316
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:51,339
one 7 to 1650 10 as a target as I'm

317
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,880
highlighting here copy paste copy paste

318
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:53,880
for the win

319
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:00,010
so we set up as a target now I don't

320
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,969
know what OS it is so I set him up as

321
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:05,110
unknown once you get connected in cobalt

322
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,180
strike you're smart enough to pull that

323
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:12,339
system information and it'll update this

324
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:16,209
table now this is where I'm getting

325
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:19,089
ready PS exec straight across but I

326
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:23,349
forgot I need to set up the listener so

327
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:26,140
when doing the SMB named pipe and let's

328
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,880
just get the move it further head and oh

329
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,540
yeah you could see me mess up here I

330
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,149
forgot the IP so you set up a listener

331
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,500
but you set it up on the second

332
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:40,510
interface that you want to hop through

333
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:42,160
further into the network so and then I

334
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,360
got to put in the IP here and of course

335
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,850
you know while recording a demo

336
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:52,060
I forgot the IP I needed to put in so on

337
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,550
system box beat or PC box B as I'm

338
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:59,439
calling it I set up an SMB named pipe

339
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:02,349
listener on the 172 16 50.5 and that was

340
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:08,049
the second interface in that box and you

341
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:10,470
just use SMB named pipe pick the pork of

342
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,470
your choice

343
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,559
save that and then once you have that

344
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:20,899
listener set up I'm going to say ok now

345
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:26,060
I want a PS exec to that third

346
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:29,360
no no for like I said for brevity I'm

347
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:32,000
you know there was a count reuse than

348
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,409
that here but unfortunately the real

349
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,580
world you will find that all over the

350
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:40,970
place people will use the same passwords

351
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,949
everywhere oh I'm on Starr Nick's box

352
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:47,150
what's an ad account it can't be in

353
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:49,420
there oh yeah it's the same thing okay

354
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,130
makes you sad it makes the clown's cry

355
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,900
so then you send the listener you choose

356
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,720
the listener where it says it's going

357
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:00,500
box a to boxy and I choose a session

358
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,110
this is cobalt strike and I just choose

359
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,480
the session on that box and I launch and

360
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,570
it opens up a SMB name pipe connects

361
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,930
through to admin dollar sign up load

362
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:17,600
someone's just play your load and Bob's

363
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:19,430
your uncle as you can see the fourth IP

364
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,179
line the pop up there is yet another

365
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:27,410
connection through a different subnet so

366
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:32,270
I've gone from one 92168 to 10 10 to 1 7

367
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:35,390
to 16 and then from here directly from

368
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:37,790
this interface for kollel strike I can

369
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,710
start combo strike has an arcing thing

370
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,210
you have to tell it to sleep a certain

371
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,670
amount of times or else it'll take a

372
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,730
whole minute to recycle and call back

373
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:49,460
home that is another thing with this

374
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,630
technique it is SMB so you can kind of

375
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,420
be caught you know you can be as noisy

376
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,070
as you want so sending asleep 0 it just

377
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,990
looks like SMB chatter going back and

378
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:00,200
forth and of course then you dump the

379
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,810
hashes to run me me cats and then

380
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,190
they're just showing with an IP config

381
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,139
this is the final system and it only has

382
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:12,800
one card I was I thought we kind of need

383
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:15,080
to go even further but and if you change

384
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:19,370
the view and this is a screenshot that I

385
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:21,080
showed earlier you can see here it's

386
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:25,520
showing from the attacker which is the

387
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:27,199
wonderful flaming firewall there and the

388
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,290
bottom one is the initial connection and

389
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,300
the night previs on the top one and then

390
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,639
use an SMB name pipe is top right

391
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,010
through

392
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:49,630
all the way through and you have full

393
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:51,820
control then full social control so

394
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,309
here's where it gets interesting so what

395
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:58,389
if we don't have cobalt strike

396
00:19:53,309 --> 00:20:04,030
well according to Metasploit they do

397
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:05,530
have an SMB named pipe component this is

398
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,049
where I kind of hope someone can help me

399
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:10,809
at this I had Twitter conversation with

400
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:12,429
the guy who wrote it he says it works it

401
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:15,280
should work I could not get it to work

402
00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:17,200
saved my life in my lab environment I'm

403
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,500
able to go from the initial compromised

404
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,780
one end and when I try to set it up to

405
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,110
go this too deep I could not get it to

406
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,790
work and I really do hope if somebody

407
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:30,879
else decides to tinker with this and

408
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,740
take a look at it and figures it out let

409
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,330
me know how you get it working

410
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:39,910
I will admit even with the cobalt strike

411
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,370
we were reading Rafael's blog one of my

412
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,990
co-workers he worked on it for I know he

413
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,428
spent several hours looking at it and he

414
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,950
was like all right I'm out he tapped

415
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:49,660
down and I picked it up and took over

416
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,100
and I spent a pretty good half a day

417
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,490
trying to figure it out

418
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,830
the tool is awesome Rafael is awesome

419
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,260
but some of his blogs are I would call

420
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:01,659
him like stereo instructions

421
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,919
he knows the tool inside and out so he

422
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,600
knows when he writes that he kind of

423
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,690
kind of comes across that way so it's

424
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,240
not that step by step was able to figure

425
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,100
it out and also the the very bottom one

426
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,020
was something that was blogging about on

427
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,199
the SMB name pipe pivoting him

428
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,330
interpreter and I like I said I gave it

429
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,760
several whacks several tries I'm still

430
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:27,909
tinkering with it and hoping to get it

431
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,470
fixed so cool we found out how to bypass

432
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,600
all this so what do we talk about

433
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,910
mitigating this well the biggest one is

434
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,879
let's look at your policies and

435
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,169
procedures how many hoops are you're

436
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,140
making somebody jump through that says

437
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:43,179
hey I just want a dev environment I want

438
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,250
you know three or four boxes where I can

439
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:45,740
store this information that I'm working

440
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,559
on

441
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:51,140
prepping for deployment how hard is it

442
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,960
for them to navigate that system to get

443
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,460
those set up and unfortunate that's what

444
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,340
we're hearing is a lot of the reason

445
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,530
behind us it takes too much time

446
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,139
IIT takes forever and then there's

447
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:08,389
budgeting I can just go down to Best Buy

448
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:10,390
and buy a network card so so let's say

449
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,610
we do get the proper equipment though

450
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,800
proper network segmentation firewalls

451
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,750
it's tough even consider two-factor

452
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:23,149
authentication if the information is

453
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:25,940
that sensitive my big thing here I'm

454
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,980
saying to if it's truly sensitive

455
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,980
information should be a true air gap

456
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:33,380
system and I know a lot of people arts

457
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,670
are you know have run into these air gap

458
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,410
systems but they're all plugged in the

459
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,620
same switch that's not air gapped I'm

460
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:41,210
sorry

461
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:44,719
that's segmentation yes but not air

462
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:47,929
gapped so a little bit of user education

463
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,170
the big one I have there is account and

464
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:53,150
password reuse if you have several

465
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:57,170
accounts don't reuse that same password

466
00:22:53,150 --> 00:23:00,770
and that across several systems because

467
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:02,540
once I compromised one you think ok well

468
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,610
yeah you compromised one user yeah but

469
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,678
he can login all over these other places

470
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:09,800
and I was able to crawl all around your

471
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,960
network because of that also talk to

472
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,389
them about setting up what I called a

473
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,360
homebrew Network I understand I know the

474
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,650
system's frustrating but you also see

475
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,479
what we were able to do this by walking

476
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,480
in and hopping through these systems

477
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,500
were able to get to this data that you

478
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:30,370
said we couldn't get to another thing

479
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:36,679
would be and this is a sore point

480
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:37,879
Hardware inventory spreadsheets any type

481
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:39,410
of system where you can kind of

482
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,600
inventory your hardware and if you

483
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,030
notice hey aren't normal desktops only

484
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,370
come with one network interface why do I

485
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:49,720
have a list of them now that have two

486
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:53,270
network interfaces what is up with that

487
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,010
so that's one of those big things I know

488
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,690
that's a struggle a lot of companies

489
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,690
have with is the hardware inventory

490
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:04,130
so are there any questions and if

491
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,650
anybody would like to discuss more in

492
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:09,320
detail what I did I'm more than open to

493
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:23,120
conversations afterwards especially with

494
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:25,669
a beer yes sir okay well it is an SMB so

495
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,419
there are some other mitigations you can

496
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:33,169
like not allowing remote administration

497
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:34,730
and remote access to block the SMB the

498
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:37,640
reason it worked in that situation was

499
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,740
those controls were not in place and

500
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,660
also they were using a local

501
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:46,429
administrator account across all of

502
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:48,049
those devices I was looking at Manuel

503
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:50,210
they were they were actually using it in

504
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:53,000
my it was local admin on my environment

505
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:56,630
but in a true environment it was a local

506
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,780
account that they use an ad account that

507
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:01,520
they use across the board same password

508
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:09,168
and that's the password reuse that I was

509
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:13,190
