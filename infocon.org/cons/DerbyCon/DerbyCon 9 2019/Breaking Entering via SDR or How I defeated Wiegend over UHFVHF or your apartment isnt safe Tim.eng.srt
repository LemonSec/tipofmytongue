1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
about to start already be doing Breaking

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,390
and Entering with the software-defined

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,990
radio so this is not what you want to

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,149
watch

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:14,910
I would recheck your schedule or stay

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:19,350
any witness I don't know no I don't want

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:24,210
you here if you don't want to see it do

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,369
I get announcer I just run this is just

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,140
go for it alright thanks guys

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:33,030
alright so first for Louis my name is

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,500
red Sam yeah so I I've been around this

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,710
for a while I ran with old school black

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,300
security back 2000s a lot if you ever do

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,789
any hacking in the 2000s you probably

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,530
ran a bunch of my exploits I work for a

16
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:50,160
software or I'm sorry cloud-based MDR

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,600
solution now so but in my free time I

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,730
get to do some hacking and enjoy and do

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,360
that stuff again so let's just jump

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,038
right into it so I want to first define

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,289
before we have any fun whoo that's slow

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,989
come on go go go here we go for anything

23
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,140
all right disclaimer so you guys get the

24
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,810
gist part of the reason that this is a

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,330
it's a sensitive is that the FCC gets

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,270
involved you have to have licenses of

27
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,460
broadcasts on these ranges and so if you

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,979
be careful what you say and things like

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,990
that and so just be weary about that but

30
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,179
beyond that especially when you're

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,500
receiving data it's really hard to prove

32
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,680
you receive the data right because it's

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,729
just already out there but again beyond

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,189
that what I'm going to show you how to

35
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,070
do could be used nefariously so please

36
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,380
please don't because I will certainly

37
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,899
help them to track you down it's my

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,439
career yours so all right now let's have

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,909
a bunch of fun let's do this

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,720
alright so what are we what are we doing

41
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:53,040
so let's define the problem the problem

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,840
is that I money on RF equipment and and

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,969
my significant other told me that I

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,630
needed to do something with it or send

45
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:04,289
it back and so that that really defined

46
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,170
the problem for me and so I actually so

47
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,200
I live in a and in a high-rise in

48
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,580
downtown Dallas and so what I just is I

49
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,299
won't figure out hacker don't key fobs

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,740
and go from there and so this is a

51
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,420
see our infrastructure system they're

52
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,410
replacing it right now I can only

53
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,209
imagine why I let them know but from

54
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,549
what I can tell this affects not only

55
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,410
our nation but foreign nations as well

56
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,150
and so again what we're attacking is

57
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,920
these little key fobs I'll show you

58
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,570
pictures in a second but if you've got

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,119
one button or two buttons sometimes I've

60
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,549
got four buttons they work at a distance

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,140
it's like your car door opener for your

62
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,000
house but more but think about the

63
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,649
commercial stuff right so if you live in

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,110
a big apartment complexes it protects

65
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,040
the the big garage doors it protected

66
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,570
that you're the garage

67
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,250
you have the parking garage that's the

68
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,820
word I'm looking for it protects parking

69
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,240
garages

70
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,859
it protects shared and common space and

71
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,300
so as we go into this little further one

72
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,280
of the things I do want to touch on is

73
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,180
and then the reason why I do this

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,160
is that it's important to identify where

75
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,930
you're safe where you're secure and to

76
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,930
understand the risks around that and so

77
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,240
frankly i ignorant me thought that I was

78
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,700
safe in my common space safe all the way

79
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,530
up to my door because it you have to get

80
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,510
the elevators and that's just Frank it's

81
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,340
frankly a lie and so it's good to know

82
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,260
that so I could be more aware and that's

83
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,000
my job to educate you guys as well as

84
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,780
hopefully educate the world and get this

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,739
thing upgraded all right so let's see

86
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,989
that cover everything else I don't like

87
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,709
reading off my slides so let's see yep

88
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,989
all right good deal

89
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,670
all right so again this started so I

90
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,250
like to tell stories so this started as

91
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,600
I I bought equipment and I don't know

92
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,670
anything about software-defined radios

93
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,680
and so I'm just going to tell you like

94
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,708
how I experienced it I bought a bunch of

95
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,790
equipment I was told to do something

96
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,340
with it and I thought well let me do

97
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:54,250
this and so I simply flipped it over to

98
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,140
the back I got the FCC ID number I took

99
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,270
that to Google I looked that up on FCC

100
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,738
gov that tells me the megahertz

101
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,350
frequency range that's supposed to lock

102
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,300
in it and so then I loaded Windows tools

103
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,340
to start embarrassing me but that's

104
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,230
where I started and so let's go ahead

105
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,880
and go through that process so here's

106
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,920
some examples of software-defined radios

107
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,329
they are getting a lot cheaper which

108
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,518
means you can do a lot more with them

109
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,019
the thing about SDR is if you guys don't

110
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,540
know this I know you guys probably a lot

111
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:23,650
of you probably do basically it's it's a

112
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:25,930
radio controller that's that's an FPGA

113
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,070
that can be configured and changed and

114
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,020
modified on the fly

115
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,150
I you don't have to no longer have to

116
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,130
make a lot of embedded equipment and

117
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,890
things to do RF it's you should just

118
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,060
lock in and do things right and so some

119
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,950
of the things about these they differ

120
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,770
they have different ranges some of them

121
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,120
don't have transmission modes and so the

122
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,380
chief ones don't so if you want to start

123
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,450
and you can start reading these codes

124
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,310
for 30 bucks and you'll get the little

125
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:53,590
rtl-sdr the little silver one right

126
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:55,810
there the the blue one is called the the

127
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,760
ADA on Pluto it's actually what's called

128
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,990
a research device it doesn't have great

129
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:05,170
long-range transmission and it caps down

130
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,700
at a certain megahertz range so but you

131
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,800
can do a firmware modification on it and

132
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,000
change that but so that's the one I

133
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,770
would probably recommend if you're just

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,330
playing at home and of course when

135
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,799
you're going hard I definitely would

136
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,650
recommend the lime Str that's personally

137
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,360
that's my favorite so yeah all right and

138
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,669
let's keep moving on here so that's the

139
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,430
toys I bought now let's define what

140
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,770
we're going after do any of these keys

141
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,330
look familiar

142
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,880
you know that's what we're doing you

143
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,520
guys want to find out how they work all

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,860
right sweet these things are cheap

145
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,710
they're fun to use they're easy here's

146
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,420
how they work and I'm gonna blow the

147
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,479
game right out of the gate you guys

148
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,980
remember Wiegand and proximity yeah this

149
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,750
is why I can accept now you transmit it

150
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:51,460
much further yeah alright so let's keep

151
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,980
going here so the way it works is it

152
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,080
goes football fields away I'll explain

153
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,860
that further but basically these little

154
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,219
modules here are Wiegand receivers III

155
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,480
and I'll blow the the stack now I

156
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,280
implemented this in software using a

157
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,690
software-defined radio I also haven't

158
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,489
been related a transmitter and so we'll

159
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,010
go through that process but basically

160
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,750
this is the starting parting line is

161
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,920
that these are what they look like let

162
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,200
me pop out real quick I'm going to show

163
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,450
you some other examples of the range of

164
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:25,000
all the things are getting hit here they

165
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:26,560
look like these they look like these I

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,970
think I think this one might work this

167
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,610
is the new one on me but it's it's

168
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:34,630
Wiegand over 13.5 megahertz so that

169
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:39,280
should work this one right here this

170
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:42,130
device here that's a receiver

171
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,369
these guys right here all of these all

172
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,480
of them all of these guys and so on and

173
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,430
so forth all right so you get the

174
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,970
picture right so in my mind the scope is

175
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,889
pretty broad when I look at access for

176
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,380
buildings it's either close proximity

177
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,020
which is the sister building uses which

178
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,550
well now that works and then this is the

179
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,729
more long range which is basically the

180
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,930
very similar experience and so the way

181
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,270
it works is those things those little

182
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,570
device those little things are plugged

183
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,770
into some sort of logic can try I've

184
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,570
actually only backup

185
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,640
I've never actually seen the back into

186
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,320
this I have no one else to talk to about

187
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,000
this I did all this on my own so if any

188
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,440
of this is wrong I will actually take

189
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,990
some Corrections because I just went at

190
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,640
this by myself but it's the way I

191
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,370
imagined that these work is that they're

192
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,250
tied into some sort of circuit that

193
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,740
relays that Wiegand code back digitally

194
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,270
over a wire to a serial port or

195
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,280
something where a computer is there that

196
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,229
runs software that takes that in that

197
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,299
looks up in a local database and says

198
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,719
yes or no it's kind of how I imagine

199
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,000
that works

200
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:56,800
this guy's not that makes feel better

201
00:07:43,000 --> 00:08:00,160
good good here we're friends now you got

202
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,700
this button here we go all right all

203
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,250
righty so great i define the problem now

204
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,800
let's start defining kind of how we how

205
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,360
we unpack this right again I started

206
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,700
with simple Windows tools

207
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,620
I'll get more advanced but I had to

208
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,810
start somewhere I started with cubic STR

209
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,640
and what I did is and so this is what's

210
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:23,470
called a heat map where that's what I

211
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:25,810
call a heat map and so again so I went

212
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,419
to the FCC website my specific one said

213
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,310
295 megahertz so I said okay I know

214
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,348
where to start so I punched in 295

215
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,510
megahertz and you'll see that kind of

216
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,430
right here and I just held the button

217
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,419
down and then you'll see there's streaks

218
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:42,429
of energy going across at that range and

219
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,478
also you'll see if you guys may not know

220
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:46,989
this but I like this these are called

221
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,459
harmonics yeah so you can actually pick

222
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,890
up on frequencies you're not

223
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:51,880
supposed to on accident okay well we'll

224
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,880
get into that too because there's a

225
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,160
really cool things you can do about say

226
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,420
and harmonic sampling okay let's keep

227
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,009
going here so anyway I got that I

228
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,180
thought well that looks interesting that

229
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,259
looks like what I'm looking for but what

230
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,899
the hell does that actually mean

231
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:06,930
and so after googling more I came across

232
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,730
the next tool wait that's actually not

233
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,250
true so what I did I went back and I

234
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,529
record I recorded it in this as a WAV

235
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,500
file and then I found out you could open

236
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:18,240
up in audacity so audacity so my DJ

237
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,949
friends use audacity to make beats and

238
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,120
 and apparently you can also do it

239
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:25,529
for RF and so and so this so to that

240
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,779
point this actually really helped me out

241
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:31,019
I put the stick together you know so

242
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:33,600
maybe help you I realized this is music

243
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:35,370
so we're playing music on notes at

244
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,569
certain skin at certain intervals right

245
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,579
and so that's I'm just gonna help put

246
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:39,660
that in a more perspective but this is

247
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,969
what it looks like when it goes across

248
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,920
when you cut it horizontally so what

249
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:54,360
we're looking at is the amplitude yes

250
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:56,189
sir no so this is no no this is so this

251
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,630
is what's called as 295 megahertz and

252
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,800
what you do is then you want to do

253
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:04,470
what's called harmonic sampling where

254
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,609
you bring all the way down hmm yeah so

255
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,730
anyway so this is what it looks like a

256
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,709
little energy pulses and I thought well

257
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,209
let's what do they look like together so

258
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,790
this is what the data looks like going

259
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:17,310
across so you'll see it's a bunch of

260
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,189
data data data dots and so I counted

261
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,290
them up there are 33 I thought well

262
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:24,899
that's interesting so I took that number

263
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,540
33 I went back to the FCC registration

264
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,269
information lo and behold it says wagon

265
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,680
33 bit implementation I thought okay now

266
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:33,509
I know what protocol it is

267
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,508
I know it's Wiegand I know that's what

268
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,649
the data looks like how do i how do I

269
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,000
figure out what the wagon code actually

270
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:42,269
is and how do I actually do that with

271
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,899
with with technology so keep in mind

272
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:48,329
guys I'm three hours into this and at

273
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,529
our three I actually figured it so I

274
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:51,839
figured out he used a pencil and paper

275
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:53,550
and was able to do it manually and

276
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,959
figure out the bit sequence and so I'll

277
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,920
show you what I did so that from there

278
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,979
it took three weeks that's right the

279
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,300
code so we'll go from there so again you

280
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,899
guys might see a little bit of a pattern

281
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,569
here all right so let's talk about

282
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,260
initial initial stuff so before I know

283
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:09,209
what the

284
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,830
represents we already have a vector of

285
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:15,330
attacked you guys see that let's go back

286
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:19,440
does that data look like it changes it

287
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:21,540
all it doesn't so if we're playing a

288
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,790
musical note or me a piece of music and

289
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,370
you press play on your p3 player that

290
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,660
will work so immediately without having

291
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,940
to know how the hell it actually works

292
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,500
you can record the sound and then

293
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,900
retransmit it and that will help you

294
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,490
they don't open the door no all right so

295
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,689
that's level one any questions aren't

296
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:42,000
you we already started cloning them

297
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:44,750
automatically alright next oh wait wrong

298
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,750
way sorry

299
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:53,219
alright so and I need to uh before I

300
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:55,410
keep going I do want to cite Holly Grace

301
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,360
I think that's her name so I actually I

302
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,920
found some of her research that did cite

303
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
and she had gotten up to this point and

304
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,439
so I think it's I just wanna take a

305
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,760
moment it's always important to

306
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,490
acknowledge the folks that didn't work

307
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,960
around us especially women of security

308
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,170
and so I just want to throw that out to

309
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,060
her but honest but I didn't want to stop

310
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,219
there I just I was hungry to find out

311
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,989
more so so what I'm really good at

312
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,450
software I'm really good at software and

313
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,740
so if I can get this the software I can

314
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,810
do a lot more with it and so I

315
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,220
thought that's what I got to do to make

316
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,550
me feel like I've kind of kicked this

317
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,380
over the fence so let's go into the

318
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:30,449
process how do you do that

319
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,689
it's called data demodulation remember

320
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,380
modem modulation demodulation

321
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,080
demodulation we're going to break it

322
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,400
down into bits so here an example of a

323
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,170
bunch of different demodulation

324
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,850
algorithms if you guys are familiar with

325
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,000
it I I know that a lot of people play

326
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,180
with PSK and ASX and oh okay

327
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,470
they're very those are very popular that

328
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,089
is not what they're using in this in

329
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,120
this context I do think that their

330
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:56,430
implementations of this in FSK that will

331
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,320
break down into wagon of it basically

332
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,030
come back to wagon but for the

333
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,490
implementations I've seen so far all the

334
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,839
ones I've caught and they're actually

335
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:08,270
called differential pulse position

336
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:10,890
modulation and so let's explain that I

337
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,780
know this gets a little kind of nerdy

338
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,830
and confusing but we'll get to the part

339
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,750
where we start messing with stuff I

340
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,280
promise alright so this is the science

341
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,930
of it this is important so in case I die

342
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,930
you guys can keep this project going

343
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,660
so here's again yeah sorry cuz I can't

344
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,099
maintain it for every guys alright pulse

345
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,290
position modulation this is how it works

346
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,240
alright we got we got amplitude we got

347
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,640
band and in time so basically the waves

348
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,160
are going across in a linear time span

349
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,020
from in this example right to left

350
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,120
I guess that's that's fair yeah right -

351
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,949
I guess it does no it goes left to right

352
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,690
yeah left to right left to right thank

353
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,310
you all right and so in this context

354
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,160
what we're going to be looking at is the

355
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:49,619
amplitude and other scenarios it may be

356
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,719
different and so what you guys this

357
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,290
looks similar to what you guys saw on

358
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,260
that thing

359
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,689
little pulses every periodically awesome

360
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,300
so what it comes down to is see do I

361
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:03,690
have that on this perfect okay

362
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,479
there's two types of PWM and ppm PW it

363
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:09,450
so the difference is PWM requires your

364
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,830
clocks to be synced on both ends but ppm

365
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,390
doesn't and so that we're not going to

366
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,820
talk about PWM because it doesn't it's

367
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,819
not beneficial okay so with ppm this is

368
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:21,180
how it works so think of it like I said

369
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,360
a a measure in a song and I've got four

370
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,599
beats okay and so in those four beats I

371
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,390
have will say there's there's two bits

372
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,790
in those four beats now I can either hit

373
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,260
on the first note and that's a 1 or I

374
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:38,610
can hit on the second note and that's a

375
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:40,880
2 and every two beats represents a bar

376
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,740
bit does that make sense

377
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,780
maybe okay let's try it again so look

378
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,670
out here look at how this starts at the

379
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,709
beginning and it on the one beat and

380
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,599
then there's a space and then it's the

381
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,990
one beat so we know it's a one it arts a

382
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,460
zero

383
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,130
and it's a zero but look at this shift

384
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,620
there's a shift to pause and then it

385
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,870
hits on the up beat right and so now

386
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,400
we've shifted to a 1 now we're in the

387
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,890
shifted so it's now what they do is call

388
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,750
shifted registers where we're also

389
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:08,130
because a finite state machine where

390
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,570
you're shifted into a position now where

391
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,670
I'm in an offset position I'm in the

392
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,560
position of one so when I know that the

393
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,959
beat is the exact same space away from

394
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,819
me at the one position it's still a 1

395
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,710
but when I get a half beat in front of

396
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,600
me I'm back to the zero position does

397
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,190
that make sense so when you do this when

398
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,780
you send it down the wire I don't have

399
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,280
to know we our clocks don't have to be

400
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:31,199
in sync because I can calculate this

401
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:33,380
based upon the starting beat I know

402
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:38,060
everybody's eyes are glazing over

403
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:43,640
oh cool well I'll give you the mic when

404
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:46,849
I'm done no I'm sorry yeah I appreciate

405
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,770
it all right so let's go appreciate it

406
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,870
okay so in this let's talk about a

407
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,069
little bit more advanced stuff so I go

408
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,800
like I said I gave this presentation one

409
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,150
time and San Antonio and some other guys

410
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,040
in the crowd challenged me because

411
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,689
there's a little extra time and said

412
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,250
well why don't you hack my key fob it

413
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,750
said 415 megahertz

414
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,270
I said well that's fine let's do this on

415
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,940
the fly well come to find out his is

416
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,340
much older and the space between each

417
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,110
beat was much wider than the stuff that

418
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,270
I had been working with and so I had to

419
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,640
go back and introduce a variable time

420
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:20,240
that you can change based upon that beat

421
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,380
size and so for this I the Monarchs or

422
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,510
the ones that were going out though that

423
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,210
works for my demo is a twit as a value

424
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,350
of twelve twelve but I think for the

425
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,090
older stuff you would actually reduce

426
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,220
that value maybe to an eight to make

427
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,730
this make it wider so it falls into sync

428
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,140
of a where everything hits so again

429
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,090
that's something we need help figuring

430
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,170
out so if you guys have older ones play

431
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,820
with that value let me know when it

432
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,240
finally starts working and that will

433
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,650
help me update the software all right so

434
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,750
now that we got that solved and we know

435
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,699
where the bitchin how to put this into a

436
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,770
bit stream list let's break down wagon

437
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,500
again right because it's always good to

438
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,720
have a refresher yeah all right so the

439
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,700
way the bitstream works is with wagon

440
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,700
you have parity bits actually on either

441
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:05,240
end and some in the middle depending so

442
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:07,280
in this example I I did 33 bit it goes

443
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,140
as old as 26 bit which is the original

444
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,210
stuff which gives you about this much

445
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,670
space to use as far as data you get a

446
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:16,460
facility code and then you get a card in

447
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,980
a burn it's usually about 24 bits and so

448
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,260
24 bits plus the facility code of 1 byte

449
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,079
actually equals 33 bits because you have

450
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,089
you always have parity bits on each end

451
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,360
so for the RF guys out there trying to

452
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:32,389
demodulate remember if you see data

453
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,800
streams going across always assume there

454
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,480
are parity bits on both ends of it

455
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,550
because that's how everybody does their

456
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,110
data so if they're sending 8 bits down

457
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,370
the wire it will be 10 bits because

458
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,379
you'll have parity on both ends I've

459
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,909
heard affirmation from this with so many

460
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,810
people this weekend so it's just a good

461
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,810
reminder when you're doing this

462
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:50,490
but so again so the gist is that you

463
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:53,340
have a facility code and then you have

464
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,470
your unique ID number the facility code

465
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,658
identifies what billing is or it could

466
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,639
be the garage door versus the front door

467
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,870
and you may have two buttons or you may

468
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:02,789
have four buttons each one will have a

469
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,729
facility code and an ID number it sends

470
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:08,309
the facility code is is there's two ways

471
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,870
I've seen doing it I've got an example

472
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:11,820
here where the facility code is

473
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,070
different but the ID number is the same

474
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,889
and I've got an example from smiling the

475
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,500
crowd where they're both different and

476
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:21,000
so either way it doesn't really matter

477
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,139
because when we start sniffing these out

478
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,600
of the wire and we start doing the

479
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:27,570
enumeration of this stuff it's very easy

480
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,830
to understand anyway again the idea is

481
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,769
that again we take that bit stream out

482
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,269
of the air we convert it into a RF

483
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:38,159
number and so this actually comes in to

484
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:39,720
a hex value or a 33 bit bit number and

485
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,240
so when you break that this hex number

486
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,419
down the facility code is 16 and my card

487
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,830
ID number is one full ship 1 4 6 3 501 3

488
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:53,070
oh yeah looks like i zoom into this good

489
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,689
for me all right all right so like I

490
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,639
said let's get to the fun more fun part

491
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:59,179
let me show you how I actually did it so

492
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:02,340
again what what the what the goal was

493
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:04,559
all right what the goal was is to break

494
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,779
this down and basically implement this

495
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,360
as a software what that what they were

496
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,100
doing is hardware and so I had never

497
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,990
actually worked with new radio before

498
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,029
it's actually a beast to understand to

499
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,029
begin with it's really complicated first

500
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:20,750
for me I actually didn't want to do a

501
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:22,830
new radio I thought the RTL SDR

502
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,570
libraries would be a lot easier it

503
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,610
seemed just a lot a lot faster to get

504
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,250
involved but the downfall of that was I

505
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,870
could never transmit right and so it was

506
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,340
kind of it was it was worthless to do

507
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,719
that and I wanted to do the full

508
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:39,689
spectrum to show you I could do both

509
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:41,490
ends of it because I ain't no Punk all

510
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,169
righty so I'll explain this a little bit

511
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,179
I know again you guys are gonna eyes are

512
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:47,159
gonna glaze over but this is what it

513
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:50,820
looks like to to put put this together

514
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:54,240
and a new radio the secret of me

515
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,950
figuring this out is Wikipedia and

516
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,480
that's that's it Wikipedia and a few

517
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,159
extra googling a little bit extra

518
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,150
googling so what you have on the left

519
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,550
are your sources

520
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:06,990
now in this example you'll notice I have

521
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:09,240
a source for Pluto STR Pluto is my aide

522
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,250
on Pluto the little blue thing the

523
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,800
rtl-sdr is what I have plugged in right

524
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,850
now it's silver I've got a lime SDR the

525
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,700
other thing you'll see there's a wav

526
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,409
file now the reason that's important is

527
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,030
that when we go into transmission and

528
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,560
you don't want to break the FCC laws you

529
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,200
can transmit to a WAV file and then

530
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,600
replay it and and validate your work so

531
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,860
just again in case anyone tries to get

532
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,909
me in trouble I got proof I didn't never

533
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:35,340
do that all right again so what it does

534
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:39,030
is it goes from the left and it keeps

535
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,500
going right google says that you need to

536
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,110
do a high pass filter and a low pass

537
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:47,100
filter and then a amplifier then a gain

538
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:49,740
control and what I found is that that I

539
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,689
I did all those steps manually but come

540
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,790
to find out the new radio actually

541
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,110
provides some modules that will do the

542
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,899
majority of it for you in a single

543
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,520
module so it made it a lot smaller one

544
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,640
of the other things I learned is about

545
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,810
down sampling so down sampling so what a

546
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,620
sample is is that it's how many how many

547
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:11,760
bits that are turned on or off per

548
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,159
individual moment that it receives the

549
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,379
data and so what that means is you can

550
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,970
get a lot of data so if I'm sampling a

551
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,120
million bits at a time that's a lot of

552
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:24,000
data the problem is that that million

553
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,280
bits needs to represent whatever you're

554
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,410
listening to so 295 megahertz if I were

555
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,680
to do that true I need a sample rate of

556
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:32,820
200 595 million right but that does

557
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,290
something that's not how it works and so

558
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,270
what you do is you can down sample it

559
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,980
and we down sample it to say a million

560
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,290
that's what's called harmonic sampling

561
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,670
and it brings everything down so what

562
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,950
you don't know is it will you up

563
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,150
and you start doing your math and I can

564
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,860
never figure out I couldn't ever hear

565
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,650
anything well come to find out I really

566
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,939
wanted a hundred K or 200 K not 2

567
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,830
million which is what I thought I was

568
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,580
dealing with that makes sense so what

569
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:58,379
was gotchas alright so again we put it

570
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,699
through filters the reason we put

571
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,530
through bandpass filters low and

572
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,940
high-pass filters is that we want to

573
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,010
make sure the signal we're getting is as

574
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,110
clean as possible because if we have a

575
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:10,170
noisy signal it's real hard to do stuff

576
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,870
with from there we actually send it

577
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,860
straight into an AMD modulator that's

578
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,080
the part where the

579
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,500
they apply the lopez addition lowpass

580
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,049
highpass and gain gain controls so gain

581
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,250
control the point to that is it amps up

582
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:26,400
the amplitude as much as possible

583
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,320
without fuzzing the signal it's that way

584
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,900
you can have it that way it works as

585
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,760
best as possible basically so just kind

586
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,620
of as a side note all of this stuff can

587
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,049
be implemented using hardware

588
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,399
electronics it just so happens that you

589
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:39,780
can use these modules to do it as well

590
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,630
so I want to make sure that I don't

591
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:45,000
deviate and deviate from the original

592
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:47,100
message that all this is RF stuff this

593
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,630
isn't just I wrote a bunch of software

594
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:52,939
to do this okay so this can definitely

595
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:55,590
done with embedded devices all right but

596
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,530
another thing that I do is so this is

597
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,510
actually an older and older with AMI but

598
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:03,750
the basic thing I do at the very end is

599
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:06,360
that I bring the the level down a little

600
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:09,840
bit let's see it's right here I bring

601
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,309
down a constant of 0.7 I bring down the

602
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,639
signal and so the reason I bring down

603
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:16,350
the signal is that I I want to use zero

604
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,210
as a value to measure and whether or not

605
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,760
if I have a peak or i-5 a signal there

606
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,980
so what I did is I brought this the the

607
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,390
noise down just below zero so that it's

608
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,210
all fuzzy right there so when I do get

609
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,320
signals its its true zero and so what I

610
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,410
mean by that is let me show you how it

611
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,409
works

612
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:40,110
all right tested before you guys got

613
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:42,390
here so I know good alright so what

614
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,510
we're looking were see right now is is a

615
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,010
couple plot graphs and so what I have to

616
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,129
do is I have to take off the auto range

617
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:58,620
it's never done me well also I have to

618
00:23:50,130 --> 00:24:00,419
increase the time range I think so we

619
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,209
want to get into something closer to

620
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,710
eighty or a hundred 116 I'm gonna bring

621
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,559
this down so you see right now this

622
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:11,390
signal is at a negative point O three

623
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:17,370
negative point three bring it down

624
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:19,799
alright alright so we've got a nice

625
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:21,030
solid signal here right and so watch

626
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,679
when I click this and so the way it

627
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:26,840
works is that again they go pew pew pew

628
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,840
and run across okay

629
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:31,020
and then what I did is I wrote a few

630
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,940
different modules the first module is a

631
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,800
peak detector the peak just says when

632
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,870
the hell what what what is a peak when

633
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,510
is and what is my peak value greater

634
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,189
than X right and so I just chose zero

635
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:44,370
because that's just made it more simple

636
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,200
for me so all that says that once it

637
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,699
gets here and it's a peak it passes the

638
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,590
samples off that are Peaks it says hey

639
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,660
this is a peak go go go

640
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,689
so the next step is then to demodulate

641
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:56,760
that and so inside here we have a couple

642
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,460
values we have the sample rate and the

643
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,350
pulse width and so the sample rate again

644
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,500
I mean for the entire project and using

645
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:07,199
a million 1 million samples a moment and

646
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,929
then like I said the pulse width that's

647
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,670
for what you need to adjust for doing

648
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:13,920
older types of attacks these older key

649
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:16,440
fobs probably from the tooth older 2000s

650
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,910
maybe 90s but it should be able to work

651
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,360
you just have to adjust that higher or

652
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:26,070
lower and so let's go back and finish

653
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:34,020
the process here I will make this

654
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:35,189
visible apologize you zoom in you all

655
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,550
right so you guys see that going across

656
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:40,170
so that's the bitstream and that's the

657
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,200
actual zeros and ones that I was able to

658
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:46,020
pull off the RF and then I in so right

659
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,270
here I note that I I find that there's

660
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,300
36 bits so in this one that I got off

661
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:54,210
Amazon there's 36 and the example I'm

662
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,500
gonna do for a second there is 33 and so

663
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,480
in this example so I think there's a bug

664
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,670
in my my parity checking algo I'll show

665
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,559
you a second but because it seems to be

666
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,090
just fine and reliable so on this one

667
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:08,280
it's facility one we go back and run it

668
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:11,189
again nobody's running oh good for me

669
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,660
all right all right so let's holding

670
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,280
again again this is the first button the

671
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,010
facility code of one see it going across

672
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,300
and keeps popping popping yeah all right

673
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:22,370
so now what I'm to do is I'm to hold the

674
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:25,620
second button you ready what changed

675
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:27,239
that's it right so now I have confidence

676
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,439
for the mote well to some degree then my

677
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,110
 works right

678
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:36,020
do you mind would you get the other one

679
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:36,020
yeah on cue dance puppet

680
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:45,000
so in this one yeah that's fun so in

681
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,700
this one

682
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,370
it's there's 33 this is a different code

683
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,890
the facility code is 16 and the ID

684
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,709
number is completely different go ahead

685
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:59,010
and do it again

686
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:01,540
the other the other button if you mine

687
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:04,150
okay so in this example so this is

688
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:06,760
actually from the building the facility

689
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:16,750
codes are 13 and the ID number I think

690
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:18,160
is completely different there we go yeah

691
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,110
see here's there too right there is

692
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,000
ended with a 1 so in this example

693
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,169
they're completely different so I'm

694
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,490
gonna get into this little bit further

695
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,800
but let's talk a little bit about that

696
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:29,860
key space so this number can be anywhere

697
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,899
between zero and FEMA's several million

698
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,060
for 24 bits several million and for

699
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,310
32-bit obviously it's an unsigned

700
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:38,350
integer or not maybe it's not obvious to

701
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:40,840
you it's unsigned integer so that's 0 X

702
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,840
F F F F F F F F F F right so it's 200

703
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,730
something billion but what I've seen in

704
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,669
in production are out in the field is

705
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:57,520
that the values I've never seen anything

706
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:58,840
less than $16,000 key space it seems

707
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,270
like there's this sweet spot they're

708
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,500
using and so when you're doing this keep

709
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,940
that in mind if you ever have to

710
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,190
enumerate and brute force it on your own

711
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,600
I would I mean it's just much easier

712
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,800
people live there right so it's just

713
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,090
messy you just sit outside for two

714
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,919
minutes and pick it up out of the air

715
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,060
but if you have to force it you're sure

716
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,520
you know there's ways of doing that what

717
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:23,409
so let's get into that

718
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:25,930
doo doo doo doo next all right so this

719
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,630
is my setup at home like I said I live

720
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:31,090
in an apartment complex in a high-rise

721
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:34,810
so I was able to set my laptop up near

722
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:37,659
the back door and then put it 10 floors

723
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:41,429
up and so I was getting building codes

724
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:43,810
from I don't know we're actually

725
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:46,740
but I can tell you over one weekend I

726
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:48,908
got all everybody in my buildings code

727
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,379
another side note

728
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:53,019
so if you live in an old building and

729
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:56,639
the pipes aren't properly grounded you

730
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:56,639
can turn your building into an antenna

731
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:02,769
all right so I've already kind of

732
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:06,159
spilled the beans on that that's what it

733
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:08,710
looks like that's that's an old key fob

734
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,840
I used to have actually I had I broke it

735
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:14,019
because I took these apart and I was

736
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,238
working to uh to reprogram them and dump

737
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:18,399
the data and I it up and so I got

738
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,899
in trouble downstairs and so I can't

739
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,668
break any more so I gotta quit messing

740
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:24,580
with those I started buying some all

741
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:26,289
right so where are we at right so in my

742
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,899
experience my opinion I've demonstrated

743
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:31,658
that not only can I find where the data

744
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:38,199
is I can read the data I can show you

745
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:40,419
what the data actually is and and then I

746
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,129
understand more of the problem so in

747
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:44,559
that regard I understand the key space

748
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:46,928
problem I understand more about vectors

749
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,149
of attacking it right and so now that I

750
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:51,099
know how to read it let's go full ham

751
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:53,590
right let's write it and so that's

752
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:54,789
what's called modulation so again we

753
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,859
have two so decodes we've got card

754
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:57,970
numbers we can clone these things out of

755
00:29:56,859 --> 00:29:59,859
the air so I like you to have to do is

756
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,619
replay what I hear but if I want to

757
00:29:59,859 --> 00:30:05,109
start you know brute-forcing or doing

758
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:09,099
more things for the data then let's go

759
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:10,629
the next step all right all right so

760
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,309
this is the modulation stuff and so I

761
00:30:10,629 --> 00:30:14,019
don't know if I publicly release this

762
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:18,129
yet I'm just waiting to see if I can

763
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:19,570
trouble nut but I did confirm that the

764
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:22,238
this will be a part of the pin to

765
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,769
project and so I'm sure as long as I

766
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:26,499
don't get trouble we'll have both

767
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:27,549
modulation and demodulation in there but

768
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:34,960
this is the way it works it's basically

769
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:38,519
the exact opposite so what we do is we

770
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,450
go through a root raised cosine filter

771
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,369
going fast good for me

772
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,200
I would put through a low-pass filter

773
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:49,418
again we're trying to remove all that

774
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:52,590
noise before we send it out we again we

775
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:56,080
put a constant in there to to reduce

776
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:58,478
some of the way the data looks is that's

777
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,978
for whatever reason I took this part of

778
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:02,750
this as an example for somebody else

779
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:07,010
that wrote a ppm modulator demodulator

780
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:08,030
for RC cars and for whatever reason he

781
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,440
kind of helped me in those last bit

782
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,960
because those just constant values

783
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,340
seemed to work for me but let me know if

784
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,170
you guys have any problems and I'll be

785
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,800
happy to debug and adjust it for you

786
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:20,870
guys but just as a side note on this so

787
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,870
again this goes back to RF even though I

788
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:27,469
implement this in a new radio I also

789
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:28,939
bred boarded this so you'd be surprised

790
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,200
what you can get order from China off

791
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,880
the Internet

792
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,530
I mean I guess you are so I mean I took

793
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,420
the thing apart I went through and

794
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,010
marked every piece of electronics and

795
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:43,040
wrote it down looked it up figure out

796
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,810
what it was ordered it from China looked

797
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,770
at the circuit breadboard it at home

798
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,230
right

799
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:51,139
pretty pretty basic like I said I broke

800
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,880
a couple of one or two part of the

801
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,890
problem I was having is that they don't

802
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,800
make the programmers reprogram errs for

803
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:59,930
this circuit anymore so what I had to do

804
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,120
is I had order 16 of them to be

805
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:04,880
generated to be made so I could

806
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,459
reprogram these and so if you want you

807
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,190
can actually take these apart apply it

808
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,080
dump the data modify the facility code

809
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,690
and the white and the wagon code are in

810
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,629
the sorry the your code and then

811
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,920
reprogram it back right and so if you

812
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:21,080
want to get that far you can literally

813
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,180
clone somebody else's fob as a fob and

814
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,620
keep rolling so that's perfectly

815
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,420
possible and absolutely doable

816
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:28,310
you can also breadboard your own

817
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,290
reprogram er I kind of gave up halfway

818
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:37,429
through that though it's a lot hardness

819
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:39,800
any sounds okay so what are the

820
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:41,000
limitations of this right because I

821
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,560
because the part of it is to understand

822
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
what the attack service is and what all

823
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,480
we can do the reason I have the Turtles

824
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,650
there is it takes a little bit every

825
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,740
time you hold the button down

826
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:54,590
it sends five different if the message

827
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,690
five times and then it stops and you

828
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,129
have to press the button again or it may

829
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,370
or may pause and then it'll keep doing

830
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,870
it and so with that what that means is

831
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,270
that we really can't we can't brute

832
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,159
force it really effectively not without

833
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,080
patience now somebody did another

834
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,880
project about some harmonization tricks

835
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,500
and things you can do to speed some of

836
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,910
these things up I don't know if it

837
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,500
applies to this but I'd certainly be

838
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,350
interested to find out and that's just

839
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,270
something that's Explo

840
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:20,340
sorry that I turned like to know more

841
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:24,000
about but really what we're talking

842
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:26,760
about again with a 33 33 bit key there's

843
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,780
24 bits which is 16 million values but

844
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,660
like I said I hadn't really seen

845
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:34,410
anything past 1.4 million in anything

846
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,450
less than 600,000 additionally we talked

847
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:38,640
about the facility codes facility codes

848
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,289
are once again meant to differentiate

849
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:47,160
for buildings or certain access to

850
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:50,700
certain locations mm-hmm all right so

851
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,470
what's the market impact so I pulled my

852
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,039
local group of people and from what I

853
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:58,590
can tell it's again it's split into the

854
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:00,600
the complexes that like what I have and

855
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,149
then it's split into the proximity cards

856
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,000
now in my understanding they both have

857
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:07,700
the same issue they can both be clones

858
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,530
this one just works much further away

859
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:14,070
there are what I call smart apartments

860
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:16,260
now where it's Indian smart apartments

861
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:18,149
where it's in the in technology

862
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,639
integration where up to your front door

863
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:22,049
lock and I and so I don't know if you

864
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,419
guys saw a couple months ago somebody

865
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,100
was in Forbes magazine because they were

866
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:29,009
able to unlock somebody's front door

867
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,659
from the cloud so he and I talked about

868
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:32,929
opening up a cloud sort of Breaking and

869
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:37,020
Entering service for as a cloud offering

870
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:40,050
to us so here's what I would like to ask

871
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,869
for you guys is because I have a limited

872
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:44,669
ability of asking people where they live

873
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:47,010
and what kind of security system they

874
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:50,940
have I need some help kind of getting

875
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:54,450
metrics from everybody so if if you

876
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,770
could I guess DM me or help me put

877
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:57,450
together a poll because what I'm trying

878
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,160
to figure out as I communicate this

879
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,410
further down the line is is how big is

880
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:05,549
this problem again from what I can tell

881
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:08,690
it seems big but that also goes back to

882
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:11,490
the question is is it important and so

883
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,260
coming for like I said coming from me my

884
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,919
personal safety and privacy is pretty

885
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:20,910
important I always thought that part of

886
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,369
this is a secure secure system and I to

887
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,020
me to know that it's not it really put

888
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:27,270
my mind a different thought process and

889
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,530
so we either need to decide as an

890
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,259
industry or as an

891
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,850
country whether or not this is security

892
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,410
or not so if it's not security then we'd

893
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,700
have to do with the problem and we we

894
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,379
focus on our front doors and it's not a

895
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,770
big deal as long as we all assume that

896
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:42,660
risk but if we expect this then our

897
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,550
entire nation's infrastructure needs to

898
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:48,359
go replace this and fix it and there's

899
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:51,150
no in-between so I feel defeated because

900
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,100
I don't see anything changing because so

901
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,050
goes back to business if I already have

902
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,270
it implemented what incentive do I have

903
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,310
to replace it I don't I'm already making

904
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:02,070
my money the the margins in in real

905
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:04,470
estate art that aren't that great right

906
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,210
like they're always trying to cut cost I

907
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,200
have a couple customers there that are

908
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,600
per couple my customers are in the real

909
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,069
estate industry and do exactly this and

910
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,080
so I know what the business models look

911
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,600
like and I know that they'll laugh if

912
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:18,810
they have to replace it in 1300

913
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,540
apartment complexes across the nation so

914
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,370
in regards to that I don't know how to

915
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,560
solve the problem all I know how to do

916
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:30,630
is raise awareness to it I'd certainly

917
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:32,790
like some feedback on that as well all

918
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,920
right so let's talk about this so we

919
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,380
kind of went through the process let's

920
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,750
talk about next-level mess oh let's talk

921
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,850
about some of the fun things I did so

922
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:45,660
guess what if your building is an

923
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:51,480
antenna you can just broadcast noise and

924
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:54,569
jam the signals nobody can get in you

925
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,030
can also keep broadcasting open codes so

926
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,260
the doors never lock we already have a

927
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:03,270
homeless problem so I don't wanna get

928
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:04,740
our victim but sound like a good idea we

929
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:07,950
also have the theory that there's god

930
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,919
codes I I haven't proven this yet but it

931
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:16,109
sounds like it makes sense to me I know

932
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,790
that I know that fire departments and

933
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,920
things like that use a manual access

934
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:22,259
bypass a gate bypass it's a little hook

935
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,570
thing that completely disables a so

936
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,280
it doesn't apply I know that the

937
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,830
constable when I was served a subpoena

938
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:32,490
to testify a few weeks ago that she has

939
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:35,069
a key phone but I also know that the

940
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:38,189
guys that manage this stuff have broader

941
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:39,900
ones that work across different all

942
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,010
their customers at the service right

943
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,330
because they're not going to walk around

944
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:47,100
the big key chain

945
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:49,170
floki fobs so I'll take help but that's

946
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,610
a theory we think we can prove we think

947
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,750
it's out there it just it's like an

948
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,390
Easter egg hunt we just gotta figure out

949
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:56,250
what it is all right so let's go the

950
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,830
next step so again I'm an application of

951
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,510
a dev guy so application bugs is there

952
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,549
any impact where you can do things with

953
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,230
a Wiegand code that's maybe that maybe

954
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,730
that code gets translated into a couple

955
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,470
characters or something that you can do

956
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:10,080
later that you can pollute over a period

957
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:12,000
of time I don't know I wasn't able to

958
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,850
legally get a copy of the software that

959
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,230
ran the stuff so but again if somebody

960
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,490
has a copy of it I'm happy to

961
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,060
reverse-engineer it I'm really good that

962
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:22,319
and we can find out more information

963
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,090
again I talked about the expectations of

964
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,380
security and privacy when you walk in

965
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,500
here did you expect it you had privacy

966
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:30,540
at home by doing this yes no or do you

967
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,370
just assume that there it wasn't safe in

968
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,440
the apartment complex to begin with yeah

969
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:36,930
all right maybe I'm just foolish that's

970
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,510
fine all right

971
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,160
so additional suggestions we talked

972
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,650
about a unique facility code per user

973
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,240
could be possibly and it's not my

974
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,880
suggestion the vendors out there in the

975
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,100
field say a solution is they using

976
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,110
unique facility code per user I don't

977
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,120
see how that helps that doesn't benefit

978
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,860
anybody because I just sniff one as soon

979
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,810
as I get it I can redo it and I can do

980
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,250
other things so it may been it may it

981
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,020
may keep people from trying to enumerate

982
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,550
them but in the grand scheme of things

983
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,259
everybody has to access their home at

984
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:07,820
some point in time and it's just a

985
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,820
matter of moments before you've got one

986
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:16,040
all right how fast am i okay

987
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,149
so again so closing statements so we got

988
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,000
new key fob systems we went to that

989
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:23,490
process getting bi-directional making it

990
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,380
rotating keys that's that's you know

991
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:31,169
going to the car process now that just

992
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:33,000
opens up more problems of jamming it and

993
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:36,150
then rebroadcasting it and taking and

994
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,410
taking those measures I kind of like

995
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,120
have more of the philosophical

996
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:40,440
conversation that I feel like my own

997
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,650
personal safety is more important than

998
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,470
my Tesla and so I feel like this should

999
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,760
be done at home first and then trickle

1000
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,470
down to the car industry and not the

1001
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,660
other way around so I just want to point

1002
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,580
that out all right you guys have any

1003
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,940
questions I'm sorry to go ahead now I

1004
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,940
apologize

1005
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:19,250
okay great thank you so much I

1006
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:21,590
appreciate your help yeah I like to

1007
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:24,770
transcribe it back to music because not

1008
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:26,270
everybody is into bits and bytes and so

1009
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,040
something that we all can share it kind

1010
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:35,810
of helps a little bit yes sir in the

1011
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:37,190
back and left yeah so you don't want to

1012
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:39,770
get in legal trouble

1013
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:41,240
so transmitting again FCC on these

1014
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,800
certain ranges you have to register with

1015
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,390
the FCC to be able to do that and so

1016
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,700
theoretically the FCC helicopters can

1017
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:51,740
come down on you I don't really see that

1018
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,259
being a thing so let's talk about the

1019
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:57,109
risk of it the actual risk they have to

1020
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,430
triangulate you and if the range is only

1021
00:40:57,109 --> 00:41:00,369
a few football fields

1022
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:03,200
unless you're broadcasting from a tower

1023
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:11,770
you probably should be just fine but

1024
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:11,770
again this is all hypothetical yes sir

1025
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:32,540
yeah basically yeah well yeah you know

1026
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:34,340
those those old push-button locks don't

1027
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:38,560
work well either anymore any more

1028
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,560
questions is there I'll come back to you

1029
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:51,689
yeah yeah this is over and this is over

1030
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,260
VHF this is over the same thing your

1031
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,260
TV's are on

1032
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,680
yeah so we're talking 500 feet like I

1033
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,270
said I was getting things from blocks I

1034
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,040
don't know where these buildings are I

1035
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,530
don't think they're downtown I'm not

1036
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:30,560
really sure cuz I'm so high up but they

1037
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:32,120
look a lot of information yeah so the

1038
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,830
door proximity is not the problem or

1039
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,400
solving that's that's at 128 kilohertz

1040
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:39,200
this again this is over VHF so this is

1041
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,730
yeah so it's not this is 500 feet this

1042
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,620
is it's the same thing as you at your TV

1043
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:47,210
came on in the 80s and 90s same the same

1044
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:48,830
signals yes no this is this is the this

1045
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:56,120
is an old problem found in a new

1046
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:57,680
implementation yeah 13th is 13.9

1047
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,210
megahertz yeah

1048
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,250
let's still the mess so that when I said

1049
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:05,620
maybe I hadn't with that but I've

1050
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:14,060
tested everything from 295 up to 4 415

1051
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:15,170
yes are you next so so far in my testing

1052
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,380
I have not found any that have

1053
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:20,410
implemented a rolling code yet no sir

1054
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:20,410
yes sir

1055
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:37,490
yeah bro yeah bro yeah bro yeah bro yeah

1056
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:41,240
you could do that that may have happened

1057
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:42,830
yeah so so so basically what you do is

1058
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,220
it's a Raspberry Pi with a lithium

1059
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:48,319
battery right and then you can actually

1060
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,120
set up trickle charges to if you want to

1061
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,850
trickle charge that back but yeah just

1062
00:43:50,120 --> 00:44:03,100
throw the bushes or put it put the

1063
00:43:52,850 --> 00:44:03,100
ceiling or in the stairwell good

1064
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:10,109
yes so this is already up I published

1065
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:14,820
this back in March it's on github.com

1066
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:20,160
it's it should be a part of this Wow you

1067
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:21,390
know what no wonder no way downs us so

1068
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,118
if you follow me on Twitter I already

1069
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:26,730
posted earlier today red sand BL for CK

1070
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:28,410
that's that we the easiest way and

1071
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,330
hopefully I can talk to these guys and

1072
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:33,569
get it integrated also it's gonna be

1073
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:35,490
added to pinch pin to the guy at zero

1074
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,740
just told me that so that's exciting

1075
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,919
any more questions in the back right

1076
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,919
there

1077
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:55,069
no I saw that too that your point I

1078
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,400
never had the outliers the range was 600

1079
00:44:55,069 --> 00:45:00,980
K to around 1.4 or so or and maybe it's

1080
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,839
14 million I can't read 1 4 I can't read

1081
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,730
the number I think is 1.4 it was a it

1082
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,009
was a lower range than I expected much

1083
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:08,270
lower range than I expected

1084
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:09,500
but I don't think I don't think that's

1085
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,099
not I don't not to say that that's not

1086
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,900
possible

1087
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:20,630
I just might experience out in the field

1088
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:21,619
good yeah sure yeah but I just figured

1089
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:30,440
it's easier to implement on my cell

1090
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:32,329
phone so yeah so I work for a company

1091
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,930
right I own my own company and I pitched

1092
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:38,569
to them making RFIDs and they laughed me

1093
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:52,040
out the door so I don't think the

1094
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:52,520
markets there for that so yes sir that's

1095
00:45:52,040 --> 00:46:06,710
a good idea

1096
00:45:52,520 --> 00:46:08,660
I like that so I will take so that's why

1097
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:10,369
I'm here guys I'm here to find you know

1098
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,569
see if the community is interested in

1099
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:14,540
this or not if you're interested let's

1100
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:16,700
do more stuff I I write big data

1101
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:19,308
security analytics algorithms and I do

1102
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:21,020
other like so this is just for fun

1103
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:24,650
for me so any more questions for I know

1104
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,910
I'm right on time no questions all right

1105
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,110
great guys thank you I swear it trap me
