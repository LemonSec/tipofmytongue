Derby con thank you for having me

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,340
so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,410
my journey to becoming a see so it is

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,080
not necessarily path that anybody else

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,849
on the planet should ever follow but you

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,579
will learn some of my mistakes along the

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,500
way and anybody who ever decides that

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,840
they want to be a see so by the way you

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,719
have to have a special kind of problem

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,940
to like doing this but if you do ever

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,000
decide that you want to be see so please

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,269
reach out to me and I would be glad to

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,780
give you advice counsel and put you in

18
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,780
touch with other sees house so as I said

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,940
my journey was not actually a very

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:02,300
straight path when I was younger a child

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,539
computers were really in the province of

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:11,039
governments universities school systems

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:14,970
and I was oh I was a newspaper delivery

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,090
person actually back then it was a

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,479
paperboy and I got my route from my

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,030
younger brother so back in the day the

27
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,539
town I grew up in the newspaper route

28
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,939
was passed from person to person and my

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,560
brother was in elementary school and it

30
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,439
was given to him because it was a boy

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,600
and what happened was he wasn't big

32
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,149
enough to actually carry the newspapers

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,460
so that was the only reason I as a girl

34
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,009
in my hometown actually got a paper

35
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,079
route I learned about collections then

36
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:50,579
and decided I never wanted to have my

37
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,189
own business I did babysitting and I was

38
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,520
very devoted to my father who was my

39
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,979
hero and still is I did volunteering his

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,689
candy striper decided that I did not

41
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,810
like medicine at all because of that

42
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:06,539
blood and guts stuff back in in that

43
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,878
time period my high school had a

44
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,750
computer but it was punch card driven

45
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,280
and calculators were too expensive

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,470
I had a calculator because my father

47
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,300
was an engineer but we weren't allowed

48
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,359
to bring them to school so I actually

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,610
used a slide rule in high school so

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,530
completely different generation and the

51
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,790
concept of being in computers was not

52
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,319
something that I really thought about so

53
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,810
when I was in high school in college I

54
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,940
worked for my father at Mullin court it

55
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,700
was an HVAC company I started as a

56
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,920
bookkeeper traditional see that adding

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,260
machine that literally was the model

58
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,350
that I used all of the bookkeeping was

59
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,410
done on paper although my father was as

60
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,859
an engineer was he used a computer

61
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:58,769
system called an apricot it was a

62
00:02:52,860 --> 00:03:00,569
personal computer out of the UK and kind

63
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,760
of a competitor to Apple so we were

64
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,660
actually playing with computers in the

65
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,030
early 80s it was just a little unusual

66
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,440
but what happened was and this is me

67
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,720
doing a little bit of social engineering

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,230
with my dad which I actually did fairly

69
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,450
frequently

70
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:21,119
still do he had Tim knockers HVAC guys

71
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,548
and as a bookkeeper I was making minimum

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,579
wage and Tim knockers were making 10

73
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:29,280
bucks an hour and I got to work doing 10

74
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:32,250
knocking which was awesome but again

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,120
crossing that line back then as a female

76
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:40,530
doing construction work it was really

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,480
really unusual so I went to college and

78
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,519
by the way I could not figure out what I

79
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,250
wanted to be when I grew up I started in

80
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,880
engineering by the way engineering if

81
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,609
you do not if if you haven't had higher

82
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,700
level math doesn't work really well so

83
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:59,760
change colleges my parents put me in a

84
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,828
college in Maine that had no interim

85
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,840
visitation between the sexes there

86
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,100
literally were sisters that lived

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,260
between the male and the female

88
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,760
buildings and in the winter there was

89
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,578
enough snow that they could tell if you

90
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,140
tried to do anything it was a it was an

91
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,789
environment where we pulled a lot of

92
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:21,709
pranks I to raise money to pay for my

93
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:25,140
education I did tutoring I was a

94
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:27,390
professor's assistant I babysat faculty

95
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,849
staff oh I worked in the cafeteria the

96
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,380
jobs that

97
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,170
the best we're washing the floors and

98
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:36,760
dishes pots and pans I did those I was

99
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:40,540
also on the softball team and I was on

100
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,340
the student choir and oh that setup was

101
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,290
what we had for our radio station I was

102
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,820
a DJ at the radio station so I was

103
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:53,290
highly involved in a lot of things but I

104
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:54,909
was unsuccessful in in engineering so my

105
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,110
parents enrolled with me in nursing

106
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:01,240
remember what I told you about blood and

107
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:04,420
guts so that was a semester and then I

108
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,300
went to liberal arts that was a semester

109
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:10,750
then I went to general business that was

110
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,570
a semester the head of math convinced me

111
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,280
to become a math major because he needed

112
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,409
enough students because there was

113
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,599
another student that was a math major in

114
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,570
the ADA to graduate and I did that for a

115
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,940
couple of semesters was one class short

116
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,520
of a math minor when he said oh we don't

117
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,280
have enough students so then I became an

118
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,169
accounting major and I graduated because

119
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,200
I had too many credits and I was Thunder

120
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,570
so the reason I wound up with an

121
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,810
accounting degree was just time I think

122
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,430
I could have been a perpetual student

123
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,710
but the one great thing about the

124
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,380
accounting class was I had a professor

125
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,109
who told fraud stories the deal was if

126
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,159
you got to class and nobody had

127
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,890
questions and everybody turned their

128
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,710
homework in he spent the entire class

129
00:05:53,890 --> 00:06:00,130
lecturing on fraud stories which is cool

130
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:02,469
because it was how do you break into

131
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,800
systems how do you you know how do you

132
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:09,220
convince people of everything and

133
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,510
anything so in some ways it got me down

134
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:18,160
the path of what we do in a lot of our

135
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:21,190
work as hackers so short story worked

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,470
for CCH Compu taxes tax analysts Oh tax

137
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,660
is really boring I did get to work on

138
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,370
system conversions they actually

139
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,650
acquired ADP worked on that system

140
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,680
conversion but I was so out of there

141
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,520
so then moved to New York and worked for

142
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,669
the tenement asset and

143
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,909
there I my first job was a data opera

144
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,889
and data entry operator which is really

145
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,500
funny because in high school my teacher

146
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:47,419
typing teacher told me that I needed to

147
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,110
go to college because I needed a

148
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:52,609
secretary to type for me anyway

149
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,360
back then we were running on a burro

150
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:59,120
system to do the budget we used Lotus

151
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,449
1-2-3 is anybody here old enough to even

152
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,599
know what Lotus 1-2-3 is oh thank you

153
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:08,330
but anyway you know so we were using we

154
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,120
were using large floppies um oh and we

155
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,979
still had paper Ledger's I also was

156
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,930
doing more volunteer work cuz I that's

157
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:21,289
what I do and I ran a phone bag for a

158
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:24,979
political campaign which as somebody who

159
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:28,250
was in their early 20s directing people

160
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:32,960
and doing schedules for volunteers is a

161
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:37,250
really interesting activity I then moved

162
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,739
to Florida and in Florida I got a job as

163
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,620
an accountant and the same my 15 minutes

164
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,770
of fame it's over I was called the city

165
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,990
saver the city of st. Pete had 32

166
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,620
checking accounts that had never been

167
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,169
balanced and I did that I started doing

168
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,779
volunteer work at GF away so the one

169
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:58,940
thing I didn't tell you was mean public

170
00:07:56,779 --> 00:08:01,430
speaking not so great when I was in

171
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,469
middle school I tried to run for office

172
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,740
and forgot my name when I got on the

173
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:09,680
stage so I was doing volunteer work but

174
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,020
it was behind the scenes so the

175
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,789
government floor of the the Florida

176
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,680
government finance officers and the

177
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,870
government finance Officers Association

178
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,630
I mean these are really exciting groups

179
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,940
of people by the way if you ever run

180
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,219
into these conferences get to the food

181
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:30,639
line first because they will run out of

182
00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:33,320
food from there I got a job working for

183
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,659
Tampa City Council as their budget

184
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,680
analyst so this was my first experience

185
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:41,990
working directly for a board the NACD is

186
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,260
a great resource and it has information

187
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,540
about dealing with boards they put out a

188
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,140
wonderful article about different board

189
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,819
members and

190
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:53,090
approaching them yeah I've lived it

191
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:56,600
instead but the problem with budget is

192
00:08:53,090 --> 00:09:00,260
it's make-believe numbers they round up

193
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,160
there's no print preciseness it just

194
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:07,100
made my skin crawl I was using

195
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,980
statistics because you just do all kinds

196
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,110
of quantitative analysis to give you the

197
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,400
warm and fuzzy feeling that the numbers

198
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,100
you're giving or write and it's like

199
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,480
well I can make it do anything and

200
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,040
they're like yeah just whatever you're

201
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,010
comfortable with I was never comfortable

202
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,270
so back to accounting I went so it

203
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,740
worked for the children's board of

204
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,660
Hillsborough County great little

205
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,190
organization except for I was working

206
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,010
for somebody who didn't believe in

207
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,470
computers so they actually purchased a

208
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,280
computer that I was supposed to convert

209
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:40,250
to but uh you know until we get

210
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,530
everything done manually you're gonna

211
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,840
have to wait so I looked at this

212
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,819
computer every day for six months

213
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,630
and I wound up leaving because part of

214
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:53,540
my job was our payroll was done by ADP I

215
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:57,770
literally had to run a calculator and

216
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:00,699
manually check the numbers from ADP

217
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:03,079
because the woman I was working for

218
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,020
mistrusted computers that much this

219
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,360
little bizarre from there I moved to

220
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,410
Pinellas County Schools 23rd largest

221
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:15,500
school district in the nation it was a

222
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:18,670
great opportunity for me I started in

223
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,580
accounting we did system conversions

224
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,979
from a mainframe system to an as/400 so

225
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,110
yes here was a school system that was

226
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,220
moving away from punch punch cards to

227
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,900
these magical computers oh and they were

228
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,600
actually going to be doing things like

229
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,579
Excel spreadsheets and I was tasked with

230
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,820
teaching people how to use these systems

231
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:47,330
it was fun I was at the same time a Boy

232
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,580
Scout leader for my son's troop by the

233
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:53,450
way the Boy Scouts of America doesn't

234
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,690
really like white women in Florida they

235
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,700
make you wear yellow polyester shirts

236
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:01,220
and I don't know anyone with pale

237
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:05,150
complexion that looks good in yellow and

238
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:09,080
yes sir in Florida is just cruel I was

239
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:11,120
getting my MBA at that time and oh I was

240
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,150
doing work with the Florida school

241
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,700
finance Officers Association and again

242
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,230
much of it was behind the scenes I was

243
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,730
trying to do a little bit of public

244
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,540
speaking because it was small groups

245
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:27,320
I was almost okay with it I got a job as

246
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:30,290
the chief audit executive and it was a

247
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,250
great job but the school bookkeepers

248
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,810
most of them were doing their

249
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:37,100
bookkeeping manually and there were a

250
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:39,709
few that did have accounting systems to

251
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,170
to keep track of the books and I was

252
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,150
trying to convince management to give us

253
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,890
a bookkeeping system for all of the

254
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,470
schools in the district and they weren't

255
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:51,770
going for it well I have a wonderful

256
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,960
bonus son and his mother was a teacher

257
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:59,090
in the school system and he hacked out

258
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:02,150
of her classroom computer into the

259
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,560
school bookkeepers computer and oh I had

260
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,199
my business case and yes they gave me

261
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,079
the money and I implemented a computer

262
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,140
system for all the bookkeepers and it

263
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,090
was it also had computer assisted audit

264
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:17,930
tools all kinds of wonderful stuff

265
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:20,090
having a great time with it but it was a

266
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:23,380
job that was a lot of work it was a lot

267
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:26,570
of meeting with parent associations

268
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,490
booster clubs it was kind of a 24/7 job

269
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,530
and I was trying to have work-life

270
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,210
balance because I had children and I

271
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,160
wanted to know what they actually looked

272
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,900
like my daughter would come to the

273
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,689
office and I knew I was in trouble

274
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,340
because she was small and she would she

275
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,720
figured out control-alt-delete was

276
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,250
giving me the blue screen of death so

277
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,050
she would just come into my office and

278
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,150
just that was the first thing she did

279
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,719
one never show up in the door so I went

280
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,910
to the head of internal audit for the

281
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,710
city of st. Pete and asked for career

282
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:58,579
advice and his career her advice was

283
00:12:54,710 --> 00:13:01,400
come work for me you can get your

284
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:05,630
credentials and eventually you can look

285
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,160
at getting my job so I went and worked

286
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,870
for the city of st. Petersburg which

287
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,620
doesn't make sense to go from chief

288
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,970
audit executive to IT Auditor but it was

289
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,750
the only way I ever thought I would

290
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,270
actually

291
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,090
grow and I was very uncomfortable being

292
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,680
an audit executive without the

293
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:25,400
certifications I was doing volunteer

294
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,500
work at a girl at a local kindergarten I

295
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,900
was on the school Advisory Committee for

296
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,820
my son's school I was doing girl scouts

297
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,550
their uniforms were much better than the

298
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:39,050
Boy Scouts so that was a good move I got

299
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:41,569
a CI a I got a CI essay I got a CIS em I

300
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,670
was like credential crazy by the way

301
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,160
part of the reason I got the cisa was it

302
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,079
was a job requirement and back then the

303
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,410
exam was once a year I didn't know that

304
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,740
when I took it so I was doing volunteer

305
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,719
work for the local aisaka chapter I was

306
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,990
there sis a coordinator and then I

307
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,320
became the president of the lat local

308
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:07,310
chapter and then became their system

309
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:11,600
coordinator so continuing to move along

310
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:14,150
and then I went blind and I mean

311
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,480
completely and totally blind I was a

312
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:20,150
fairly heavy smoker and managed to

313
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,900
inhale at the exact same time as I had

314
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:27,319
an awesome migraine and it was I was

315
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:29,300
hospitalized I did recover most of my

316
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,680
vision but I lost all peripheral vision

317
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:35,870
for years so yeh visions back and I go

318
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,120
get a job at Hillsborough County

319
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,980
Aviation Authority most of you guys

320
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,720
would know it is Tampa Airport it's

321
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,550
actually multiple airports and

322
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,390
Hillsborough County is the size of the

323
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,599
state of Rhode Island

324
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:51,110
I was hired because a friend of mine was

325
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,860
the CIO and there had been a series of

326
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,870
audit IT audit comments and she was told

327
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,850
if she didn't clear them and make sure

328
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,040
that they never happened again she was

329
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,050
going to be unemployed so I was hired I

330
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,740
cleared those comments within six months

331
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,750
I was declared there see so and as part

332
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,660
of that process I was like oh you guys

333
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:14,120
have PCI you should be PCI compliant

334
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,400
which they didn't know about and they

335
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,830
didn't understand so I had to bring that

336
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,540
program in and all of the things that

337
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:25,730
come with PCI so part of that was

338
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,310
teaching security awareness and I tried

339
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,810
to do some security awareness myself

340
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,819
I went through the office I found

341
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,979
passwords I took pictures with

342
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,300
nameplates

343
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,310
wasn't very successful convinced

344
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:41,089
management that I should hire some

345
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:43,040
social engineers Ryan and a guy named

346
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,800
Chris Nickerson came in and here is

347
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,800
where my life changed I was about 30

348
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,439
pounds heavier um but I was there

349
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,500
get-out-of-jail-free card and because we

350
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,410
had police officers with guns and yes

351
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,690
they do use them occasionally I went and

352
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,939
kind of followed behind and shadowed

353
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,940
them and they taught me what they were

354
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:09,140
doing and were incredibly gracious and

355
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:13,550
oh my gosh they went so many places they

356
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:17,150
should not have been at catch Chris

357
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:19,300
later I because Ryan later and the two

358
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:22,630
of us will tell you these stories it was

359
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:28,189
incredible the only problem with that is

360
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:32,810
I had I was working with I was working

361
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:36,140
for the CTO and the CIO and they didn't

362
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:40,819
want this kind of news I did not

363
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,500
understand the I thought it was all show

364
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,070
you what's wrong and you'll fix it I

365
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,200
didn't understand the dynamics I didn't

366
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,570
understand the social interactions that

367
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,460
I should have had with these people so

368
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,650
I'm doing all this you know Florida

369
00:16:52,460 --> 00:17:00,080
airports council we formed this group

370
00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:01,819
called WCS C F is G the guys NIT weren't

371
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,130
listening to me they told me I wasn't

372
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,660
technical get enough I was gonna prove

373
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,250
it because you know here heck I can do

374
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,720
you this I can do Linux I can do regex

375
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,280
honest I can do all this stuff I you

376
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
know I can install systems I do it at

377
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,699
home

378
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,550
I got the CISSP C believe me I'm

379
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,839
technical and I also got the C risk in

380
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,099
the C guy and I'm doing all kinds of

381
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,938
stuff for ice hockey and these guys are

382
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:26,300
still not listening to me I didn't

383
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:29,200
understand that I had the role I didn't

384
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:34,669
have to prove myself to these people I

385
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,920
was I was talking because I felt like I

386
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:40,220
wasn't being heard but the more I talked

387
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,750
the less they were listening because I

388
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,050
really needed to be

389
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,250
listening to what they meant and not and

390
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:51,919
some of the stuff that they weren't

391
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:56,840
saying so I went and I took a sans class

392
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,250
with oh it's Kurtis and on penetration

393
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,290
testing because I was still in this mode

394
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,050
of I am going to learn this stuff and I

395
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,790
am going to prove to them all of this

396
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,460
stuff that they should know but

397
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:10,639
obviously don't and I was in the class

398
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:14,120
and I wasn't feeling well

399
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,860
and I called on Edie and I couldn't

400
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,340
remember how to RDP into another machine

401
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,100
and I asked ed how and he looked at me

402
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,620
like lady you don't belong here and he

403
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:28,580
was right but what was happening was I

404
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:31,879
went blind again and I had what's called

405
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,919
a macular hole it was pretty terrifying

406
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,110
because remember I'd lost the peripheral

407
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,340
vision and the macular hole meant I lost

408
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:43,219
the vision in the middle so I was like

409
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:45,500
this doughnut so I knew surgery and so I

410
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,360
told everybody if the surgery didn't

411
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,980
work and I went blind I was not getting

412
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,649
a seeing-eye dog I was getting a

413
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:56,120
seeing-eye pirate parrot and I was just

414
00:18:51,650 --> 00:19:00,530
gonna walk around saying mark so surgery

415
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,669
worked so here I am the seaso and it

416
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,720
does actually have a different

417
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:08,540
definition yes it is the impending

418
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,150
sacrifice officer when you report to the

419
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:19,970
CIA or the CIT oh my gosh am i playing

420
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:21,050
again this is crazy but when I went and

421
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,260
had surgery again

422
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:25,970
I started appreciating things Oh Holly

423
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,590
I'd literally stopped in the middle of

424
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,350
the street when I noticed Holly my

425
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:33,439
children will never forgive me for that

426
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:35,449
but I go back again I am struggling with

427
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,400
this concept of being a CSO because

428
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,110
there are different levels of C so Brian

429
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,170
Krebs is actually written a wonderful

430
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:44,600
blog about it in terms of when you are

431
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,700
in immature Arctic organizations you are

432
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,370
reporting to the technical folks there

433
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,410
is no segregation of duties you are not

434
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:54,809
meeting the intent and the requirements

435
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:59,129
what you are doing is a technical

436
00:19:54,809 --> 00:20:02,428
security requirement so this was an epic

437
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:03,959
fail oh my gosh I went blind again okay

438
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:07,980
I am NOT giving you any more blind

439
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:10,259
things it happened seven times okay but

440
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,179
and part of it is my life is changing

441
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:15,450
because all those the stuff that related

442
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:18,269
to code my eyes I can see I in plants in

443
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,759
both eyes but I have this blur I can't

444
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:23,669
read code the way I used to which makes

445
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,690
my life difficult so I need to change

446
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:28,619
what I'm doing

447
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:32,009
oh but clouds have texture I can see

448
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:35,369
texture it's awesome I just get

449
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:37,379
migraines if I'm reading code and I saw

450
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:40,918
this thing social engineering for pen

451
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:42,748
testers at blackhat and signed up for it

452
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,379
Chris had naggy Michelle Fincher and

453
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:48,330
Robin G changed my life they taught me

454
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:53,668
about listening to people and the

455
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:56,908
importance of knowing what I that I if I

456
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,860
listen to people and heard what it is

457
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:59,610
that whether they were saying what was

458
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,229
important

459
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:07,678
I could actually improve their lives and

460
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,749
mine so I became C so at three different

461
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,379
organizations in Venice tell health plan

462
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:12,330
services

463
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:14,399
wait jokes do you remember me saying

464
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,289
that I really really didn't like

465
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:20,809
medicine and healthcare and blood and

466
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:23,570
guts what is wrong with me so I did this

467
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:27,178
for a private equity firm not-for-profit

468
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:31,590
publicly traded company oh my gosh every

469
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:34,139
time for CIO or CTO I am making the same

470
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,509
mistakes over and over again and I was

471
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:41,998
done I decided to hang my own shingle

472
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:44,850
and start doing consulting work because

473
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:46,649
this problem of working for the CIO or

474
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,709
CTO kept happening over and over again

475
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:51,658
and I gave myself a present and I took

476
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,899
the master of level social engineering

477
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:57,559
course with Chris had neg and Michelle

478
00:21:54,899 --> 00:22:01,439
Fincher and oh Ronnie's in my class and

479
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:04,769
it was great it gave me such a sense of

480
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:08,280
self-esteem because I was doing things

481
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:10,860
that oh okay let's be honest part of it

482
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,920
is a middle way middle-aged overweight

483
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:16,409
woman can get into anywhere especially

484
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,670
if they do the professor tawny bit and

485
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:24,480
if that doesn't work I just pull out mom

486
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:27,390
so but it was a great experience I then

487
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,790
also started doing a lot of public

488
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:33,500
speaking I mean a ton last year and a

489
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:35,639
half have been amazing it really has and

490
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,790
one of the companies I was consulting

491
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,700
with as a part-time fractional see so

492
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:44,399
it's called health map and guess what

493
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,970
