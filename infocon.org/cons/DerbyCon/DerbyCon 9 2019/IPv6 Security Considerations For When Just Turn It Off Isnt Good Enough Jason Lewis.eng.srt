1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,560
listen to this talk this is not gonna be

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,710
as deep of a dive as the last one

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,840
this talk is ipv6 consider security

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,219
considerations and for when just turn it

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,820
off isn't good enough and that quote

6
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,250
just turned it off

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,410
it's one that I've heard from a lot of

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,390
people when you mention ipv6 and

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,100
security they just shrug and say yeah

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,470
you're not to call anybody out you're

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,760
all here because of that I'm pretty

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,650
confident most you're here just at the

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,570
end you can say but I'll just turn it

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,980
off anyway you know okay I got this the

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,239
idea for this talk I'm talking with a

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,529
colleague of mine you know I was having

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,349
this big existential moment and turned

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,960
home and I said dude do you think we're

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,270
ready for ipv6 security and he looked

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,420
over and said does it matter man we'll

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,760
just turn it off and I'm like we're not

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,379
in charge we don't we know oh we don't

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,670
have switches we can't turn anything off

24
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,989
our job is just security so before we go

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,770
any further a little bit about me my

26
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,650
name is Jason Lewis I have a company

27
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,140
called route 6 security this is my

28
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,700
security job just full disclosure I'm

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,280
also in the Air Force Reserves and

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,770
disclaimer none of the opinions are

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,390
theirs they're all mine so don't be

32
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:21,020
affiliating me with anything but my my

33
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,640
background is primarily in business and

34
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:27,000
I spend a lot of my time thinking about

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,439
policy which is probably way different

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,799
than most you guys in here this

37
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:35,220
conference is not policy and business

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,130
but I heard to me when I was 7 talked to

39
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,600
my colleague before that it is the

40
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,110
reason you can't turn stuff off I

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,250
believe is gonna come up is that as you

42
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,030
move forward here's here's what I see

43
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,040
things moving is that there's so many

44
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,420
ipv6 addresses and so few epi v4

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,280
addresses there right now some companies

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,979
make extra money on the side just

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,899
selling their unused ipv4 space it's a

48
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,549
it's a revenue producer for some people

49
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,740
and ipv6 on the other hand there's given

50
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,710
away Aaron will just give you chunks of

51
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,758
it if you want it and for that reason

52
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,288
eventually what's gonna happen is it's

53
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,790
gonna be so cheap the startups are gonna

54
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,750
start using it it's already happening

55
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,760
some places starting to start using

56
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,070
they're gonna make cool applications

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,060
that do cool things and your company

58
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,470
whoever you work for whatever

59
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,170
organization you're in is gonna want to

60
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,260
use some of this stuff at some point or

61
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,640
another they're gonna run into a wall

62
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,700
right right now you have some places

63
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,679
that only do ipv4 you can't you can't do

64
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,209
anything about v6 it's gonna flip at

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,740
some points and it's just it's not going

66
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,930
to kill a rap it's not be something the

67
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,570
one thing that you have to have it's

68
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,000
just going to be subtle eventually not

69
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,859
being able to use these things or if you

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,070
are in a an organization that produces

71
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,090
some sort of consumer facing product

72
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,890
you're going to want to be able to

73
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,030
capitalize on that market share right

74
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,290
you're gonna want to be able to get to

75
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,690
those people who are using those devices

76
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,489
or that application that only takes ipv6

77
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,770
and someday somebody's gonna come down

78
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,720
and say you know what we're gonna do

79
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,120
this this is our new business model and

80
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,060
they're look at that you can't turn it

81
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,250
off even if you physically could go to

82
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,510
the machines or you can click around and

83
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,800
turn everything off and even if you were

84
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,570
able to track it on every instance of

85
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,330
ipv6 on your network and shut it down

86
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,280
your bosses would fire you all right so

87
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,480
your job your point your position at

88
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,840
that point will just be go on a new job

89
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,220
or adapt and so hopefully here today we

90
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,989
can I'm just gonna try to get you a

91
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,120
nudge in direction towards adapting if

92
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,239
that's where you're at so we can move on

93
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,390
so the intended audience for this this

94
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,890
for security personnel a lot of the ipv6

95
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,359
security stuff out there is how to

96
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,000
configure your network as if you're an

97
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,209
administrator and again it's great stuff

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,590
to read but if you're like me and you do

99
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,640
a lot of blue team type of things or

100
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,810
you're you're looking through Network

101
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,518
you're looking for bad guys on your

102
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,140
network you're not really concerned

103
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,760
necessarily with how to configure your

104
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,988
network although you will recommend it

105
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,700
to people you are concerned with ipv6

106
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,070
special considerations and how to make

107
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,329
that work for you I also assume that

108
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,280
everything here is passingly familiar

109
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,040
with ipv6 that you at least recognize it

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,049
as as a thing if I showed you an address

111
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,980
with colons and you'd be like yeah inset

112
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:13,660
v6 move on that's good and finally like

113
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,100
I said at the beginning I assume most of

114
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,700
you guys in here or the turn it off

115
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,260
folks or at least people who are

116
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,570
familiar with that position and thinking

117
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,969
hey maybe I should position myself to

118
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,500
take that guy's job whenever he finally

119
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,210
butts heads with the business people and

120
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,220
loses

121
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:35,020
so all right an overview just give you

122
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,120
an idea we're gonna talk about here I'm

123
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,310
going to cover extension headers logging

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,780
addresses attribution and by with

125
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,430
attribution I mean figuring out how to

126
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,010
associate the network traffic with a

127
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,230
host is producing it not necessarily a

128
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,630
behavior with a apt or something of that

129
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,940
nature we're talk about slack and if you

130
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:54,520
don't know what that is that's it's good

131
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,990
we'll get to that as well some toolkits

132
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,940
are out there resources that you should

133
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,560
be aware of in a few takeaways in

134
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,670
quotation marks at the very end of this

135
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,400
you should at least be able to walk away

136
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,140
with a couple things in a meeting you

137
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,090
can interject at the right point so he's

138
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,630
gonna look at you nods they exactly give

139
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:13,330
that man a raise or woman

140
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,560
so extension headers you guys were

141
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,650
probably familiar with the issue of

142
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,410
fragmentation in ipv4 right and it's

143
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,810
been fixed by and large and most devices

144
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,570
on the network fragmentation being able

145
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:28,360
to bypass firewalls because you're able

146
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,570
to hide what is actually inside the

147
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,030
packet is something that is still an

148
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:37,090
issue with ipv6 so the extension headers

149
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:40,809
are very very long potentially long

150
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:43,299
chains of information that are right

151
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:47,320
between the extra ipv6 header and then

152
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,330
the underlying data so these long chains

153
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,460
could potentially be too big to transmit

154
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,469
in one packet and therefore you might

155
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,349
need to fragment them if that happens

156
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,510
then potentially you could put together

157
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,710
especially if you don't have a state if

158
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,640
you have a stateless firewall instead of

159
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,229
a stateful one then some of these things

160
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,419
could slip through in traffic into your

161
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,470
network that you don't want so what you

162
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,540
need to be aware of is that these

163
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,450
extension headers are new to ipv6 but

164
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:17,560
they create issues similar to what you

165
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:19,210
experienced ipv4 and Wow the best

166
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,310
practice is in common sense say don't

167
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,030
let that happen we don't want to have

168
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:27,190
fragmentation sometimes it's just the

169
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,109
way things work and in particular

170
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,210
there's an issue with turning off

171
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,790
fragmentation for network devices that

172
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,060
are in between other devices that aren't

173
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,650
aware

174
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,810
that fragmentations not allowed if you

175
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,388
break that chain now you break the whole

176
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,250
system and that makes people unhappy and

177
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:46,040
once again people will tell you you guys

178
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:49,490
with your back so keeping that in mind

179
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:53,380
you it'd be nice if everybody could

180
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:56,620
agree on one standard to implement ipv6

181
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:59,540
implementations of the RFC's very widely

182
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,220
we get kind of accustomed to ipv4 and

183
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,470
how everybody just does what's supposed

184
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,480
to happen they teach it in classes as if

185
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,290
there's only one way to do networking

186
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,710
and that is what the RFC say well in

187
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:15,830
ipv6 there are competing RFC's there are

188
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,120
deprecated RFC's and if you have any

189
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,389
networking device has been built over

190
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,040
the last ten years which some is not

191
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,780
uncommon to find in many places you

192
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,580
would have a wide range of

193
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,679
implementations of best practices and

194
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,380
deprecated best practices in alternative

195
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,669
best practices implemented there so if

196
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,930
you're not tracking on these things and

197
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:36,370
you're not asking the questions like

198
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:39,200
what are we doing here then you might be

199
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,150
surprised one day to find out the people

200
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,580
are evading your ACLs and potentially

201
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,570
tossing you as well whenever they send

202
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,310
these potentially unlimited extension

203
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,560
headers through your software or

204
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,390
networking equipment the hardware

205
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,560
implementation can't handle it cuz it's

206
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,140
too big so it sends up to your software

207
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,130
and now you're unpacking these extension

208
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:03,710
headers in software and dossing and

209
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:06,680
getting dosed so be aware of extension

210
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,638
headers another thing I spend a lot of

211
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,320
time digging few logs

212
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,660
I imagine you guys do to everybody

213
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:15,950
everybody digs through logs and an ipv4

214
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,260
there's only one way to write an address

215
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:21,110
and you guys that's great it makes it

216
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:25,310
easy even ipv4 so all three of these are

217
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,960
one way or one address now the bottom

218
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,710
one I don't think I've ever seen

219
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,630
anything record an address that way

220
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,708
fully written out all the zeros all

221
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,260
those things if for those who aren't

222
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,939
familiar you can use double colons once

223
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,338
in the middle of any of that to get rid

224
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,560
of any number of zeros altogether and

225
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,930
then you can get rid of all zeros to the

226
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,099
left within the semi colons themselves

227
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,810
you can so you can make a big address

228
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,329
smaller check that is at the top of

229
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,040
there

230
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:54,269
missing semicolons apologize for that

231
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,009
our colons anyway so you're unlikely to

232
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:58,199
see the bottom example but the top

233
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:00,720
example in the middle example where you

234
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:03,689
have F E in lowercase and F EE

235
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,619
capitalized that seems like a subtle

236
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:09,599
difference but the best practice that

237
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:11,819
I've read and the one I believe in is

238
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,230
the top one where you use lowercase but

239
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:15,420
there are RFC's that are published

240
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,779
current RFC's out there that use the

241
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,089
middle one as their examples so even the

242
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,459
ietf can't figure out exactly what

243
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:26,309
they're doing it seems small but

244
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:28,199
whenever you go to use grep you're gonna

245
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:31,110
miss stuff if you're writing a script to

246
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:33,569
pull stuff out of these logs then you're

247
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,860
gonna skip miss things now there are

248
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:35,939
depending upon what you're using to go

249
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,230
through your logs they might take care

250
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:40,019
of this for you right Splunk has a

251
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,549
plugin that makes it all go away but if

252
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,749
you're regex was base it was written by

253
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,980
somebody in your shop and it was based

254
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:48,179
on the idea that everything looks like

255
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,439
one of these and then it's not you could

256
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,459
run into issues as well you might not be

257
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:54,629
logging what you need and you certainly

258
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:55,410
might be missing information all right

259
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:57,329
and now we're gonna talk about

260
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,610
attribution as I mentioned before this

261
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:01,618
is not attribution to an actor this is a

262
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,660
tributing network traffic back to a

263
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:07,649
machine

264
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,879
classically ipv4 addresses are pretty

265
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,919
simple they'll either be statically

266
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,809
assigned or DW DHCP leases that are

267
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:14,759
renewed on a regular basis and it's

268
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:16,169
fairly static if you look at a week's

269
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,939
worth of network traffic you're gonna

270
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:21,029
have a good idea of who is talking to

271
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:26,040
whom and not a lot of issues there

272
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:29,369
however with ipv6 that's more

273
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,559
complicated so one way to give ipv6

274
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:33,149
addresses is to just let the machines do

275
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,189
it themselves you can do stateless

276
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,929
configuration and they'll make up their

277
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:40,738
own address and that sounds dangerous

278
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:42,629
and it can be but that is why they

279
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:46,499
sometimes check it against other stuff

280
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:48,629
and they have the clever idea to use the

281
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:50,999
Mac these eui-64 extensions what they do

282
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:53,220
is they take those last 64 bits of the

283
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:54,720
address and then they use the MAC

284
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,869
address and then make it long enough

285
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,269
they shove fffe in the center of it and

286
00:10:57,869 --> 00:11:01,889
then they flip a bit and the seventh bit

287
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:02,130
from the left if you're looking at it on

288
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:05,250
pay

289
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,699
and that is their new new address that's

290
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,500
great

291
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:09,359
because that tells you which machine it

292
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,069
was if you know which which computer has

293
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,110
that MAC address in it then you should

294
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:16,319
have a good idea and so that makes

295
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,910
attribution fairly easy and that also so

296
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:20,339
when you take away from this is that if

297
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,600
you are lucky enough to have just be

298
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:23,699
using these kinds of addresses on your

299
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,160
network that if you see a bunch of FF es

300
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:28,469
in the middle of your addresses you can

301
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,509
probably reverse that back by reef

302
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,370
lipping the bit pulling out the fffe and

303
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:34,740
Ingle know the MAC address and that's

304
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,940
how you can figure out who was once you

305
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,660
also recorded the MAC address in your

306
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,800
logs

307
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,269
however that's not the best thing to do

308
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,519
if you're using those addresses to go

309
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,660
out over the Internet to conduct

310
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,250
business some people didn't like the

311
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,189
idea that people could be tracking you

312
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,170
by this address everywhere you go and

313
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,600
they wanted more privacy so they created

314
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:57,899
privacy extensions the privacy addresses

315
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,540
and these are actually a couple ways to

316
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:02,519
do them but the net result is that there

317
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:07,319
look fairly random they are randomized

318
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:09,660
and these addresses provide the the user

319
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:12,209
with a little bit anonymity which is

320
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,319
great unless you're using these

321
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,219
addresses to try to figure out what's

322
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:15,569
happening within your network and

323
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,800
privacy addresses are great to go out to

324
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,899
the wide world or from a security

325
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,560
perspective they're annoying much the

326
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:25,500
way that I pee second can be a problem

327
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,699
so these privacy addresses are difficult

328
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,230
and but one of the only ways are going

329
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:29,910
to be able to figure out these things is

330
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,920
by keeping track of the neighbor

331
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,689
advertisements and if that's a new word

332
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,719
to you what you guys need to be aware of

333
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:39,630
is that ARP is dead and ipv6 it's been

334
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,019
replaced by neighbor advertisements and

335
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:45,959
the neighbor advertisement or then sorry

336
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,459
the neighbor table so what you need to

337
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,050
be doing is recording these neighbor

338
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:52,018
tables because some of these depending

339
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,829
on the implementation again everything's

340
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:57,689
in varies widely

341
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:59,758
Ubuntu has a 24-hour standard a life

342
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:02,339
span for privacy address there are other

343
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,050
devices that go as low as four hours so

344
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,459
what this means is that even if you look

345
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,740
at one day's worth of traffic the same

346
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:10,309
same machine could be using multiple

347
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,559
different addresses to be able to

348
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:14,699
conduct whatever behavior it is so if

349
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,900
you are not keeping track of these

350
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:17,969
addresses if you're not

351
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,100
logging them and retain those logs long

352
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,840
enough to meet whatever look-back

353
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,920
responsibilities you have if your

354
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,660
organization wants you to be able look

355
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,949
back three days you need to make sure

356
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,199
that you're keeping these neighbor

357
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,630
advertisements that long if you're in a

358
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,310
situation where like I sometimes find

359
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,780
myself in where I'm not actually able to

360
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,209
affect how much logging is taking place

361
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,790
I am a guest on somebody else's network

362
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,620
and while I'm there I have to do the

363
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,480
best I can you can also pull these off

364
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,790
the wire and it's a good thing to retain

365
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,590
as well just capturing them because what

366
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,010
these neighbor advertisements are like a

367
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,550
narc

368
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:52,080
it's how that client whenever the

369
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,010
informations come back in is able to say

370
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,310
I am at this address

371
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:58,800
go ahead and send it to me and in that

372
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:03,239
that's gonna be your only clue unless

373
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,949
you were able to to find it on the host

374
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:11,090
itself and then finally I will talk

375
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:11,090
about the do its DHCP user IDs which are

376
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,599
they're interesting because you get

377
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,829
multiple interfaces on your computer

378
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,080
these days right like I've got Wireless

379
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,970
I've got an Ethernet connection

380
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,190
I've got Bluetooth all of these are

381
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,790
network adapters each one of these has a

382
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:28,290
different burnin address and the thing

383
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,110
about the DHCP so if you choose to use

384
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,819
dhcpv6 on your network instead of this

385
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,400
stateless Auto configuration that I was

386
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:38,190
just discussing then these DHCP logs

387
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,230
will retain this information and they'll

388
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,300
be able to associate this do it back to

389
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,370
a machine but one thing I want you to be

390
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,170
aware of just a fun little tidbit for

391
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,430
your information you never know when

392
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,900
you're gonna need any back pocket is

393
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:53,160
that the do it assigned to a machine is

394
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,870
based only off of one of those

395
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,969
interfaces and it may not be the

396
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:59,100
interface that was being used in order

397
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,870
to to go out so even though the

398
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,090
connection was wireless it may be

399
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,610
referencing the MAC address from the

400
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,350
ethernet card when this is going to

401
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,660
matter to you the most I don't know I

402
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,000
don't know but someday you might think

403
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,829
back to this talk and be like ah got it

404
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
that was an obscure piece of trivia he

405
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:22,920
pulled straight from the RFC's alright

406
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,020
so slack strange things with slack all

407
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,089
right you have router advertisements so

408
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,930
stateless auto-configuration and most of

409
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:32,399
us used to DHCP where a computer host

410
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,589
comes on and says hey I need an address

411
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,959
and the ECP server goes back to it and

412
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:37,890
is like hey here's your address here's

413
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,959
your default gateway

414
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,810
here's your dns information you have a

415
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,510
good day in Internet well well if you're

416
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,699
not using a DHCP server then you don't

417
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,860
get that kind of stuff so to fix this

418
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,899
instead now routers just advertise

419
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,550
themselves they say hey guys

420
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,310
these multicast addresses and they just

421
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,660
say I'm a router anybody out there can

422
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,430
use a router hit me up with like a

423
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,740
bulletin board in a coffee shop or

424
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,910
something like that and just like a

425
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,000
bolts on board in the coffee shop you

426
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:08,520
don't know what you're getting and so

427
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,440
some of these it's it's very easy to

428
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,569
fake your router advertisement and there

429
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,040
are multiple sources out there multiple

430
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,870
scripts have been written to just

431
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,520
generate these router advertisements and

432
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,500
what that will do is allow yourself to

433
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,600
allow you to be a man in the middle and

434
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,490
this man in middle capability is of

435
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,180
course one thing that secure people

436
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,140
don't like but assuming that the the

437
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,479
router advertisements not coming from

438
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:33,779
malicious source it could potentially

439
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,480
also come from just a miss configuration

440
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,279
a host gets on the network and says hey

441
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,680
this is this is my default gateway you

442
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,029
should try it the other host pick it up

443
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,010
picks it up since it's dirt default

444
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:45,240
gateway and next thing you know no

445
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,459
traffic's leaving your network and you

446
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,339
can't figure out why this is less of a

447
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:53,279
security issue but more of a problem I

448
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,600
run into and then this is particularly

449
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,579
an issue if you think you turned off

450
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,170
ipv6 on your network so you stop

451
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,849
worrying about it and now you have the

452
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,219
occasional rogue advertisement going

453
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,589
around all right

454
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,670
so toolkits sudden you guys are pen

455
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,500
testers as well you're a little less

456
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,819
worried about how to track logs as much

457
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,650
as you are worried about doing stuff and

458
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,859
also if you want to be able to figure

459
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,929
out what your networks posture is you

460
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,879
may use some of these the the best one

461
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:20,160
the one you if you type in ipv6 toolkits

462
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,730
the hackers choice is gonna show up it

463
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,990
is it's in Cali nowadays it is robust

464
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:29,040
and it's never let me down and I so

465
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,929
there it is

466
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,450
I recommend it but another one out there

467
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:35,779
is the si6 Network ipv6 toolkit and

468
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,159
those guys they do classes

469
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:39,919
Parris coming up here pretty soon if you

470
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:42,200
guys have funding it is also pretty

471
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,549
decent and then finally Scapa six is

472
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,529
it's not really a toolkit it's just a

473
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:47,090
tool everything thats capi can do it can

474
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:48,889
do too so you should try it

475
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,529
craft packets to make sure that your

476
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:52,488
network is actually responding the right

477
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,809
way make sure these router

478
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:55,399
advertisements are not being picked up

479
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:57,859
and they shouldn't be making sure that

480
00:17:55,399 --> 00:18:02,059
you don't have other issues that spoken

481
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:03,109
about so this is from the si6 toolkit I

482
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,940
don't know if you read that back there

483
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:06,619
it looks a lot better on my computer but

484
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,179
there are all sorts of things that are

485
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,218
in this toolkit and I chose the si6

486
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:12,139
toolkit as my example because the the

487
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:13,639
hackers choices actually has far more

488
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:15,439
than I could fit on the screen and be

489
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:16,758
multiple multiple slides worth but you

490
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,129
see here that there are things like IP

491
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,929
address analysis manipulation tool tool

492
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:23,320
perform a tax based on icmpv6 error

493
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:25,460
messages router advertisement forgery

494
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,849
and then what I want you to look at down

495
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,330
there is the scan 6 which yeah near the

496
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:32,269
bottom

497
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:35,619
it's an ipv6 scanning tool I wanted to

498
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:38,299
hit on real quick bonus ipv6 scanning a

499
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:40,668
lot people think that the obscurity that

500
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,109
having that large address space will

501
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:44,119
give you some sort of security which we

502
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:47,289
all know is the fallacy right that's

503
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:49,009
obscure security through obscurity so I

504
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,999
want to let you know that there are

505
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:52,099
people out there developing algorithms

506
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:54,080
to make it easier to scan these large

507
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:55,729
swaths and those are getting better but

508
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,859
even then sometimes your admins that you

509
00:18:55,729 --> 00:19:00,379
set your security posture for failure by

510
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:02,418
doing things like incorporating the ipv4

511
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:04,759
address it used to be into the ipv6

512
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:07,429
address so with any knowledge of the old

513
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:11,719
ipv4 scheme tebah you found it and even

514
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:13,789
then scanning the ipv6 space for a 10/8

515
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:16,849
worth of addresses is just as easy as

516
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:19,158
scanning in an ipv4 another thing is

517
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:20,629
that you use a service of the suffix so

518
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,119
that would be an NTP server right there

519
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:25,369
and that's one I mean people will try

520
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:29,689
that Oh your DNS server let's just try

521
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:31,968
your address 53 and mmm too often that's

522
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,589
exactly what it is so if you're able to

523
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:37,399
advise people against this I recommend

524
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:39,200
it and the last one is using using words

525
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:42,199
in there and there are a lot of cool

526
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:47,210
words you can create with the 0 through

527
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,799
F and finally take away if you guys are

528
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,610
going to take anything away from this of

529
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,340
all the resources I

530
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:55,250
use all the resources I've read just

531
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:58,070
read this one this is a draft RFC

532
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,320
written by a guy named binky who also

533
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:03,439
was a co-author of ipv6 security from

534
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,280
Cisco press who's he knows a lot he's

535
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,410
been working on this for a long time

536
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,530
this is about 20 pages worth of reading

537
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:11,360
total and it's like a full primer on

538
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,370
ipv6 cuts out a lot of the baloney and

539
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,850
it goes deeper into the security issues

540
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:20,419
than like I am here so that's it one

541
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:22,939
resource all right so finally the

542
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,140
takeaways this is it so if you get

543
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,340
nothing else out of this each one go

544
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,960
back and you want a sound with a little

545
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,610
bit more like you know it's been on ipv6

546
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,110
you want to be ready to take the

547
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,149
position of the guy who retires because

548
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,159
he doesn't want to bother with it and he

549
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,960
just wants to turn it all off ask some

550
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,280
of these questions like how does our

551
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,290
equipment handle extension headers oh

552
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,190
good question we'll make sure we include

553
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,678
that whenever we're purchasing equipment

554
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:45,080
you're a manager now how are we

555
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,610
standardizing our addresses all right

556
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,559
are we using capitals we're using

557
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:51,530
lowercase R we're using both do we

558
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,080
download the plug-in for Splunk yes good

559
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,010
look at me I'm considering things are we

560
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,970
maintaining neighbor discovery

561
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,640
information long enough to meet our

562
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:01,280
obligations you know will I be able to

563
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,299
attribute activity I see on my network

564
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,590
to an actor 12 hours from now are you

565
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,700
relying on me to be able to go back in

566
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,280
there and most the addresses still be

567
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,900
the same no well we got problems

568
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,790
sometimes you depending on who you work

569
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,380
for you might have legal and regulatory

570
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,629
obligations to be able to attribute

571
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:21,040
things so make sure you're keeping these

572
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:24,530
neighbor neighbor discovery logs longer

573
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:27,159
all right does anybody have any

574
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,399
questions I think a couple minutes left

575
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:36,220
all right

576
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:36,220
yes tools yeah do you make one of these

577
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:47,470
webpage this

578
00:21:50,220 --> 00:22:01,960
No is there one yeah the question was is

579
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,760
our way to there's our standard way to

580
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:29,110
communicate ipv6 addresses and I have

581
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:31,090
not seen one yes ma'am no III do think

582
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,590
that for now don't get me wrong like I'm

583
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,139
not the kind of guy who goes home and

584
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,730
sets up an ipv6 home network just for

585
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,190
the fun of it I mean like I have my side

586
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,539
network with my production internet my

587
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,600
internet went out my wife would be very

588
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:46,270
upset my kids too it's just easier to go

589
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,980
with the default ipv4 if it's easier and

590
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,690
cheaper just do it that way I am a

591
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:54,250
business background guy but I do you

592
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:55,690
think that one day that there will be a

593
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,130
business case for not doing it and

594
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,529
that's what's going to drive it so yeah

595
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:04,539
right now in the military to you know

596
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:06,820
the Stig's they they also say turn off

597
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:08,830
everybody saying turn it off except for

598
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,830
the people who aren't you know like

599
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:17,110
Facebook and Netflix and Google and

600
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:19,020
Android so so yes it's great until it's

601
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:22,500
not and really all you're doing is

602
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:25,539
avoiding technology I do think that as

603
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,789
security professionals it's better for

604
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:30,640
our jobs and our future to prepare

605
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:33,669
ourselves for whenever that's not the

606
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,409
case anymore but yeah whether whether to

607
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:40,630
turn it off or not it really depends on

608
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:50,380
your business use case yep all right yes

609
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:53,080
sir yes as of two years ago their

610
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:56,080
adoption rate was 50% well internally

611
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,330
and I've seen little exponential graphs

612
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,340
that show more a lot of people are

613
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:06,999
working ISPs and tech giant's are going

614
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,199
towards straight I peepee six now

615
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:10,840
they're gonna the dual-stack for a long

616
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,299
time I believe but but definitely want a

617
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,100
job there good stuff to know and also

618
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:23,200
yeah that's gonna be what's driving a

619
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:24,340
lot of this in the future probably I'm

620
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,360
not sure how they're implementing it to

621
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,769
make it to make it work I think if

622
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,709
they're tunneling it it's probably the

623
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:55,570
way that it's happening and ya can't

624
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:59,950
speak more on that for them so I I

625
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:02,999
believe that startups will lead the way

626
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,379
where they can't afford to do ipv4 and

627
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:07,299
and then eventually so everything's we

628
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,590
tunneled at first and then somebody's

629
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:11,230
gonna be like why are we tunneling all

630
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:14,049
this stuff every OS every major OS

631
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,759
supports ipv6 natively every networking

632
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:18,070
device major networking device supports

633
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,499
ipv6 natively why are we spending the

634
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:23,649
extra overhead and resources to tunnel

635
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:24,909
this and then there it is alright guys

636
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:26,139
well thank you my time is up I

637
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:28,289
appreciate you guys hanging out for the

638
00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:28,289
talk
