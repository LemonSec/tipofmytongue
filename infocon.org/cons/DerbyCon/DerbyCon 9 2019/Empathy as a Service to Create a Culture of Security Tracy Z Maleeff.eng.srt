the end of the talk so I am Tracy Meili

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,780
if I'm also known as InfoSec Sherpa on

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,049
the Twitter's and sorry it is very dark

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,549
up here what this talk is about I'm good

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,820
at this but just the brief overview in

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,650
case some of you are confused I'm just

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,109
going to talk about some ways to better

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,179
interact with end users and by end users

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,040
I don't mean just the you know maybe

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,600
admin assistants or the bank vice

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,640
presidents I wasn't mean other

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,840
departments you know even other tech

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,180
departments that you may work with

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,520
anybody who you are relying upon

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,350
executing security you need to treat

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,700
them as your customers so that is what

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,090
this talk is about based on my

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,590
experience as a librarian because I know

22
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,570
I never tweet about it but yeah I used

23
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:57,510
to be a library okay so first off yep

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,480
there we go I also worked at a law firm

25
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,760
for 10 years so I know about disclaimers

26
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,580
my opinion strong or otherwise or mine

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,979
in my own and not that of any group with

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,830
which I am affiliated if you take issue

29
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,900
with something that I say please invite

30
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,450
me to the bar and buy me a drink and I

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,250
will gladly discuss our differences with

32
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,659
you over a cocktail hashtag gymflow SEC

33
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,270
so I'd like to take a moment to manage

34
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,310
your expectations what this talk is

35
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,899
which I just said a second ago I am

36
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,560
going to show you some key library

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,390
science principles and how they pertain

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,689
to information security dealing with

39
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,270
with end users what this talk is not I'm

40
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,789
not trying to sell you anything this is

41
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,820
not a cure-all some of these situations

42
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,130
may not you know pertain to your

43
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,258
environment and that's fine but I do

44
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,630
have one expectation of all of you if I

45
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,659
may if you can at least please just take

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,719
one thing no matter how small out of my

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,610
talk and implement it back in your work

48
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,369
or personal life then I will consider

49
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,170
this talk a success so that those are

50
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,450
the expectations

51
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,920
and how am I going to do that I'm going

52
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,170
to do this through storytelling I'm

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,209
gonna tell you stories about my work

54
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,730
life as a librarian also as a sake

55
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:17,040
analyst and as you see the storyteller

56
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,840
is sitting I may be sitting at some

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,000
points I have a chair up here I have a

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,590
wonky knee and if my knee gets wonky I'm

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,420
sitting down it is not that I just

60
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,890
respect my audience it's that I don't

61
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,109
want to be in pain and I want to finish

62
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,339
the talk so if you see me disappear out

63
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,040
of sight it's because I'm sitting down

64
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,319
so thank you so now you're like okay

65
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,329
lady why should we listen to you so

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,799
here's my street cred so that's me and

67
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,050
the University of Pittsburgh mask up

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:45,330
before a basketball game I have a

69
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:48,420
master's degree allow any pit I'll beat

70
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,680
myself up later to the University of

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,958
Pittsburgh and I have a master's degree

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
in library information science I also

73
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,400
have undergraduate degrees from Temple

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,769
and Penn State but I spent 15 years

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,230
working as a librarian mostly in

76
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,180
academic corporate and law firm

77
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,609
environments corporate yes as in QVC

78
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,920
like that QVC I was a librarian at QVC

79
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,530
and I also worked in different colleges

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,359
but mostly in law firms so no offense

81
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,950
any lawyers in the room but I know what

82
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,269
it's like to work with difficult patrons

83
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,160
so I've been in the trenches y'all I've

84
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,230
seen some things I can I can talk from

85
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,630
experience but I also spent two years as

86
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,548
a stock analyst I'm currently changing

87
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,980
jobs which I cannot divulge at this time

88
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,989
but all will be revealed soon enough I

89
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,410
spent two years as a stock analyst for a

90
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,910
large multinational corporation so I

91
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,290
have experience there and I also have a

92
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,030
jisuk I just want to put that in there

93
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,429
so I do know a thing or two about a

94
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,090
thing or two so that is part one of my

95
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,440
street cred part two so what the last

96
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,470
law firm I was at for about eight years

97
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,329
every year the law firm had a customer

98
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,239
satisfaction survey that they sent out

99
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,310
to the entire law firm and every year

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,049
that I was there the library which was

101
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,780
the department where I worked ranked

102
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,850
number one in customer satisfaction now

103
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,790
before you think I'm full of myself I am

104
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,858
not trying to say that was because of me

105
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,048
I mentioned this because again further

106
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:12,450
to my street cred I know what it's like

107
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,060
to be on a high-performing team in a

108
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,399
difficult environment in a high-pressure

109
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,079
environment so I know what success looks

110
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,370
like so this is why I want to share this

111
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,160
with you because I've been through this

112
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,320
so hopefully you understand why I feel

113
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,080
that I'm qualified to speak about this

114
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,139
and why the Derby con CFP committee how

115
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,789
that has come I to speak about this so

116
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,550
before we go any further I also want to

117
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:39,360
clarify something everything is not

118
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,960
sympathy sometimes people use them

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,470
interchangeably they're different and

120
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,060
that hotlink therefore merriam-webster

121
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,050
hotlink I'm one might like 85 I don't

122
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,710
know where that came from

123
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:56,430
sorry Benjamin buttoning myself up here

124
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,840
okay anyway um the link up there goes to

125
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,150
a really good page on merriam-webster

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,039
and great detail explaining the

127
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,460
difference I don't want you to feel

128
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,770
sorry for your end users I want you to

129
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,099
understand what it's like to be in their

130
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:14,430
shoes okay I want you to understand what

131
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,910
it's like to be scared of security to be

132
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,430
scared of Technology to be confused know

133
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,990
and things like that because that's

134
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,310
really important I don't know what you

135
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,720
feel sorry for them I want you to know

136
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,669
what what they might be feeling because

137
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,970
that's going to help you better assist

138
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:30,099
them

139
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,290
and why do I care about this so if you

140
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,600
have a hat I suggest you hold on to it

141
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,640
if you are wearing a pearl necklace I

142
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,320
suggest that you clutch it and be

143
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,090
prepared to gasp because I'm gonna drop

144
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,090
a drop a big one on you here ready

145
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:50,520
information security is a service

146
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,820
industry job thank you can I get an amen

147
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:57,430
yes preach it preach it

148
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,930
hashtag truth bomb I hide the reason why

149
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,720
this talk came about is when I made my

150
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,030
career change from library science into

151
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,050
information security I was dumbfounded

152
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:11,200
that the way that contempt and the

153
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,600
hatred and the the attitude towards end

154
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,370
users that a lot of infoset people had

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
and you know you have to understand

156
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,670
before I was a librarian I was a travel

157
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,799
agent before that I also did a lot of

158
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,150
customer service facing jobs so my

159
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,430
entire professional career has been

160
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,049
customer facing I am very well aware

161
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,810
that those customers the reasons why I

162
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,730
had a job so when I come into security

163
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,250
I'm like you know that we have jobs

164
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,919
because we're servicing their security

165
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,660
needs right like so this is kind of how

166
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,609
this talk came about so information

167
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,700
security is a service industry job

168
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,440
because customer service is it's an

169
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,260
attitude or as we say in Philadelphia

170
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,820
attitude it is an attitude it's not a

171
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,219
separate department it's not someone

172
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,599
else's job it's all of our jobs no

173
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,400
matter what department you're in it is

174
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,040
an attitude and with apologies the

175
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,729
IceCube check yourself before you wreck

176
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,290
it for everybody else ok get yourself in

177
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,820
line so I'm gonna give you a little

178
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,530
exercise here to try and help get you

179
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:10,990
into that empathetic mindset here

180
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,010
remember a time when you were a noob did

181
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,460
you ever have learn how to play an

182
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,980
instrument I did I had a mean music

183
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,440
teacher who used to yell at me for not

184
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:24,220
knowing my scales and every good boy

185
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,169
deserves fudge and all that I still grew

186
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,530
up to be a respected member of society

187
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:31,330
mr. Bratton so there you know so that

188
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,710
was scary right I didn't understand how

189
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,039
to read music and I was trying to do

190
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,049
that

191
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,320
what about Dungeons and Dragons did you

192
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,600
ever have alright did you ever have a

193
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,250
mean Dungeon Master who got mad at you

194
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,350
because you didn't know how to cast a

195
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,310
spell on an elf or don't at me whatever

196
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,789
I don't know what I'm saying

197
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,340
but anyway that just sounded right in my

198
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:53,590
head so I'm just gonna go with it but in

199
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,570
order to understand empathy think about

200
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,310
back to when you were new at something

201
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,050
because this is what your end users feel

202
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,280
like they don't deal with you know they

203
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,200
don't necessarily deal with the high

204
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,599
tech everyday or or they don't deal with

205
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,180
security every day so it's kind of

206
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,370
intimidating and scary and you need to

207
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,039
kind of have an empathetic ear in mind

208
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,200
and I to better service them for

209
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,630
customer service so let's get to the

210
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,880
meat and potatoes use my Philly accent

211
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,800
so this is the reference interview so I

212
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,409
told you I went to university Pittsburgh

213
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,000
for masters library information science

214
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,970
degree I also call that library school

215
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,220
so in library school this was drummed

216
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,479
into us this is a well-known principal

217
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,550
and library science called the reference

218
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,900
interview and I'm not going to read the

219
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,520
slides because you were all capable of

220
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,579
reading I believe unless somebody yells

221
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,140
out they want me to read it to them

222
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,190
these are the seven steps so what I'm

223
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,110
gonna do is I'm going to go through

224
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,360
these steps I'm going to explain through

225
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,010
storytelling and examples of how I've

226
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,070
been able to take these steps and apply

227
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,069
it

228
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,840
- life in InfoSec specifically as a

229
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,460
stock analyst now I admit this print

230
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,840
here is really tiny so this I'm going to

231
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,000
read out we have a little play going on

232
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,430
here the person on the Left says I

233
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,850
clicked on a phishing link exclamation

234
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,770
point

235
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,410
and the info set professional on the

236
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:14,040
right says I can help with an

237
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:18,490
exclamation point so let's dig in

238
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:21,010
approachability how easily is it for

239
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,930
your end users to contact you does your

240
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,810
department have maybe security at

241
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,670
company comm or is it all individuals

242
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,650
does someone know how to get in touch

243
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,209
with you and you know and a lot of

244
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,250
people like oh I don't want anybody

245
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:37,240
contacted me directly get over it it's

246
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,850
your job okay but make it easy for the

247
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,320
end users do they know who to contact

248
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,450
you know do you like it if you call some

249
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,070
company you get bounced around like oh I

250
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,540
need to transfer you I need to transfer

251
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,580
you I need to transfer you you don't

252
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,849
like it do you wash it your end-users

253
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,980
like it what about the outgoing messages

254
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,720
what do you say what kind of impression

255
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,090
do you give and I'm going to give you an

256
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,330
example so we dealt with the phishing

257
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,500
emails and if people submitted an email

258
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,540
and it was deemed to be a fish they

259
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,920
would get this message or saying yep

260
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:12,339
that was malicious and that was it and I

261
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,160
spoke up I was like um can we give them

262
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,890
some steps to take or some things to do

263
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,569
so I managed to work with some other

264
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,300
people in security department and then

265
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,040
we crafted this outgoing message of you

266
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,310
know yes thank you for reporting that

267
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,040
email it was malicious if you clicked on

268
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:32,140
it if you open something here are some

269
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,480
steps we need you to take change your

270
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,760
password bla bla bla bla if you have any

271
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,880
questions or concerns contact us at this

272
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,250
and you know what change I saw I would

273
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,410
see end users just emailing us in

274
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,410
response going yep just want to let you

275
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,079
know it changed my password that went up

276
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,390
exponentially and I was thrilled so that

277
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,430
means what they read the email and they

278
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,530
did it and then they took the time to

279
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,120
let us know so whenever I saw those

280
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,010
responses come back I'd be like great

281
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,860
job thank you so much for letting us

282
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,900
know and I really feel like that made us

283
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,070
more approachable because then they

284
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,750
could just let us know that they did

285
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:09,640
things and we gave them information

286
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,220
so what are your outgoing messages say

287
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,810
to people and what's your tone if you

288
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,100
have ever worked any sort of phone job

289
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,540
they always tell you to smile when

290
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,760
you're talking because it helps the tone

291
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,880
and I can hear some eyes rolling in the

292
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,880
back I can hear you it but it does help

293
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,250
it's kind of hard to be to be nasty if

294
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,870
you're smiling in your pleasant but just

295
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,410
be mindful what is your tone and I know

296
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,750
we all have bad days but do your best to

297
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:39,719
try and rein it in and remember you want

298
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:44,320
to be approachable sprechen zie Deutsch

299
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,240
powerful se habla espanol you may not

300
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,760
speak another language but to your users

301
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,450
I work for a multinational company we

302
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,980
would get emails in another language and

303
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:58,030
some of my co-workers would get angry

304
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,770
about that and I said this it's our job

305
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,240
as customer service to figure out what

306
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,760
they're saying and to reply so what I

307
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,030
used to do was I would reply in their

308
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,880
language using an online translator with

309
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:12,970
my first sentence being I am using an

310
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,860
online translator why because they're

311
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,740
not perfect right so I don't want to

312
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,930
offend someone or confuse someone with

313
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,150
the choppy translation so your first

314
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,620
response should be you know I am using

315
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,709
an online translator and then your

316
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,800
message and then below that I put what I

317
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,180
was saying in English why because some

318
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,459
people who are multilingual

319
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,219
may have better skills reading English

320
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,190
than they do writing it okay so to make

321
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,110
sure that the message gets through put

322
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,880
it in two different ways and then this

323
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,400
also goes for awareness or any other

324
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,290
material do you have security

325
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,240
instructions in other languages for

326
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,400
people whose native language is in

327
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,110
English if you know that maybe your

328
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,870
South American offices are having

329
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,000
particular problems with phishing do you

330
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,130
have Portuguese and Spanish material for

331
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,740
them are you expecting them to read

332
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,000
English and understand what you're

333
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,850
trying to get through so think about

334
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,090
that

335
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,440
reputation when were I said about

336
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,380
checking yourself before you wreck it

337
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,510
for everybody else try to determine what

338
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,150
your security department's reputation is

339
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:21,150
within your organization now some of you

340
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,029
may be too young to remember this but

341
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:27,069
you know about what nineteen years ago

342
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:31,000
Jimmy Fallon you know Tonight Show fame

343
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,380
or infamy depending on her opinion he

344
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,010
had this sketch when sorry Night Live

345
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:38,740
where he's Nick burns the computer guy

346
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,540
and I put the the lyrics to the the

347
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,010
jingle there and that was the whole

348
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,719
sketch is that people would have a

349
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,870
computer problem and he come and be like

350
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,300
move and be really arrogant and mean

351
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,670
about it is that what your users think

352
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,579
of security do they think you're Nick

353
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:57,490
burns so first of all take an assessment

354
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,990
and you can maybe ask around or just how

355
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,910
people interact with you if you call

356
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:04,150
someone and say hi this is you know

357
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:07,089
Tracy from security do people recoil do

358
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,740
they get scared so try to figure out

359
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:13,089
what your cut your reputation is of the

360
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,530
security department and I feel seen it's

361
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:16,720
usually a negative thing I want you to

362
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,060
feel seen in a positive way so what I

363
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,650
used to do when I was in the the law

364
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,449
firm library is I would get involved in

365
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,250
activities now for you that might be

366
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,690
even just like a softball team or

367
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,010
something like that I was involved in

368
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,630
the diversity inclusion committee

369
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,760
because I wanted to be able to go to

370
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,920
those meetings and say hi I'm Tracy from

371
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,900
the library I wanted to be a physical

372
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,939
representation of the department I'm in

373
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,860
and why is this important because when I

374
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,740
first started as a sock analyst I

375
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,050
replied to a user's email and her

376
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:47,050
response to me was oh I didn't know

377
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:50,680
there were humans in security and I'm

378
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:53,680
like what and she said oh I just thought

379
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,540
it was all computers and automate I

380
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,640
didn't think any people actually worked

381
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,079
in our security department and I turned

382
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,810
to my boss I showed them email and I'm

383
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,779
like don't you people ever talk to the

384
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,810
end users he's like yeah not early I was

385
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:11,770
like oh boy like wow you you people need

386
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:13,930
me in four seconds so and I know this

387
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,939
isn't everyone's cup of tea I know some

388
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:19,630
of you are like oh screw that I am NOT

389
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,880
becoming seen one I'm gonna say about

390
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:24,970
that is things like this are skill they

391
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,290
can be learned and they can be honed and

392
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,820
also remember I said I wanted you to

393
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,829
take one thing away from this maybe this

394
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,600
isn't the thing you take away but for

395
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,940
those of you who are more inclined to

396
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,760
get involved in stuff it's amazing if

397
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,160
you go out into your company and be the

398
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,540
you know a physical face that people can

399
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,370
talk to you now sometimes it turned into

400
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,560
me feeling like a preset of confessional

401
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,000
I would go to events in another building

402
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,739
and I would say this from security and

403
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,420
people would start telling me all the

404
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,490
links they clicked on or all the secure

405
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,930
or all the security things that they

406
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,540
have in place like I have a really good

407
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:59,349
password I'm like yay thanks hi I'm

408
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:01,329
Tracy hi but sometimes it's funny and

409
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,980
you know what it helps reinforce that

410
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:05,560
you are a real person working on a real

411
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,780
problem and again approachability makes

412
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,640
you feel seen

413
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,160
all right so let's move on to point

414
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,870
number two interest I want you to be

415
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,319
interested in solving the problem at

416
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,320
hand

417
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,300
aka do your damn job now I know that

418
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,330
burnout is a very real thing and that is

419
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:24,599
a different talk but if you are not yet

420
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:26,490
jaded or burned-out you know do your job

421
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,900
be interested in solving this because

422
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,360
ultimately you know this is your job

423
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,670
security is protecting your organization

424
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,890
and I hate hot potato are you familiar

425
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,209
with hot potato of you know bouncing

426
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,560
things around this ought not it not it

427
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,510
not mine not mine passing around

428
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,579
sometimes you just need to suck it up

429
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,530
and listen to what the end users asking

430
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,690
sure there are times when you know what

431
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,430
you'll say you know there's a different

432
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,740
department that is really better suited

433
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,810
to answer your question I'm going to

434
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,150
email them to you know email them on

435
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,040
your behalf I will copy you and I will

436
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:58,230
describe the problem you don't blind

437
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,110
transfer someone on a phone you don't

438
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,000
blind forward emails you take the moment

439
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:05,939
to be courteous to your fellow

440
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,800
professionals explain the situation and

441
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,839
you copy the person on it so that they

442
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,770
can be in the loop of what's going on so

443
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,810
don't hot potato

444
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:16,439
gently hand over that potato and with

445
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:19,139
some chives and sour cream and just in

446
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,660
general I can't stress this enough don't

447
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,760
belittle or mock or be condescending I

448
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,949
know what I know things that can be hard

449
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,300
and try and believe me my last week of

450
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:28,890
work at my last job

451
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,649
there were times and I was looking up

452
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:34,130
going Lord they are testing me and I'm

453
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:38,880
Jewish and I'm still like Jesus help me

454
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:41,250
I I know it can be trying it can be

455
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,430
trying but you know what you just take a

456
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,590
deep breath empathy as a service and you

457
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:50,070
work through it

458
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,720
so it doesn't matter how many search you

459
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,360
have what your Drake grade point average

460
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,690
was how many degrees you have your end

461
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,418
users are not going to care what a leet

462
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,000
hacker you are unless you care about

463
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:05,460
helping them so keep that in mind

464
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,400
you can be the best hacker in your

465
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,049
company and that's fantastic for you but

466
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,130
your end users don't care unless you're

467
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:13,260
going to take an interest in helping

468
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,480
them

469
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,720
so you can also do this by creating a

470
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,429
safe space and then one of them is just

471
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,809
giving us users full attention how many

472
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:23,880
times have you ever called a call center

473
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,168
and you hear a lot of like laughing and

474
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,700
joking in the background and then the

475
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:28,799
person you're talking to you hear them

476
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,570
like stifle laugh or you like hear

477
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,000
yourself go on mute and stuff and I'm

478
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,428
like hey attention like pay attention to

479
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,470
me so be mindful of that there are times

480
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:40,020
when I would leave the sock to take a

481
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,640
phone call to talk to an end user

482
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,350
because I knew there was too much going

483
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,030
on there was too much background noise I

484
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,740
wanted that person to know that I was

485
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,350
paying attention and I was focused on

486
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,360
them I would just want to tell you a

487
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,270
quick story time here cold medicine Carl

488
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,129
not his real name we get a name email

489
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,200
one day at the Salk and he's like I'm

490
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,169
working from home I'm really sick I'm on

491
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,169
a ton of cold medicine and I clicked on

492
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:05,640
a malicious link help so I'm not gonna

493
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:07,230
get into the remediation part cuz I

494
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,000
thought what this talk is about but long

495
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,860
story short I finally get him on the

496
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,350
phone to talk to him I can hear he's

497
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,199
sick I can hear his raspy breathing I

498
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,899
can also hear how stressed he is I can

499
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,700
hear he's so completely stressed so long

500
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,460
story short is it turned out to be you

501
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,410
know nothing the this link that he

502
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,299
clicked on actually was taken down by

503
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,770
the blog provider so it was actually

504
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,379
just one of those like that pages in

505
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,790
here so dodged a bullet but I did

506
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,400
something a little sneaky though I was

507
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,020
like let's engage your antivirus and I'm

508
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,860
like this is gonna take like an hour to

509
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,889
run so I want you to go lay down and

510
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:45,330
rest and let this run its course now you

511
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,520
and I all know you can still use your

512
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,678
laptop all the antivirus is running but

513
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,750
I was taking some empathy this guy I

514
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,030
could finally hear him calm down

515
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,530
I got his stress level away but he was

516
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:58,020
still sick and he's still on cold

517
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,940
medicine so I made a snap decision of

518
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,840
like I'm gonna tell a little white lie

519
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:06,120
to get him away from the computer so he

520
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,500
doesn't click on anything else I'm gonna

521
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,320
tell him to go take a nap for an hour

522
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,210
and he he was like oh no okay you're

523
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,740
right yeah I'll let this run I'll go

524
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,450
step away from the computer and I'll do

525
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,190
that no harm no foul and it honestly

526
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,960
probably took me longer to tell you that

527
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,760
story than it did for me to interact

528
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,110
with him because a lot of people say to

529
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,900
me well I don't have time in my day to

530
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,830
talk to all these people if you do it

531
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,539
right

532
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,658
takes quicker to help them than it does

533
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:33,539
for you to tell the story and what's

534
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:36,120
another way you can show interest okay

535
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:41,760
you are not eating x' use punctuation

536
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:44,158
and use sentence case okay write an

537
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,340
actual letter thank you to the liberal

538
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,019
arts majors who got that reference so

539
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,490
there is a structure that you take to a

540
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,100
letter and email there's the salutation

541
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:55,380

542
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:59,010

543

sentences to I was able to convey four

544
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,360
points of information I will break it

545
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:05,760
down for you thank you for contacting

546

Handclap here but I can't with this

552
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:23,429
microphone they didn't have to contact

553
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:25,200
you they could have let it go they

554
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:27,360
didn't have to contact you you thanked

555

your end-users for contacting you and

556
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,490
then you reiterate why they contacted

557
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,830
you so the end user knows okay they

558
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,500

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,350
tell them what action you're gonna take

563
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,880
and then within a business day you give

564
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,590
them some sort of reasonable timeframe

565
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,559
of when they can expect to hear back

566
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,240
from you two short sentences four very

567
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,908
important pieces of information that

568
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,620
that user can feel seen feel heard and

569
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:01,440
feel like their problem is being worked

570
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:04,500
on and then a close best regards regards

571
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,539
sincerely Cheers is often one that

572
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,519
people use and then your signature I

573
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:11,070
know a lot of people have sig files but

574
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,960
just who are you who are you on the team

575
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,789
are you a manager are you an analyst in

576
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,419
this case I was the security team Sherpa

577
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:20,490
but who are you so this is such a short

578
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,779
email to write and it's clear it's

579
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,960
concise it can phase a lot of

580
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,220
information another way you can show

581
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,309
interest is have what I call an

582
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,409
intrapreneurial spirit and you know

583
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:33,899
entrepreneur but this is intrapreneur

584
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:36,809
this is having that drive and go get it

585
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:38,699
attitude that an entrepreneur have but

586
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:39,330
within your organization so an example

587
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,620
of this

588
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,960
was this was long before I even realized

589
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,969
I was gonna get into security I saw that

590
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,620
the CEO of the law firm had a brand

591
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,930
spanking new Apple watch when they very

592
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,520
first came out and because he was busy

593
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,680
showing everybody around that's how I

594
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,139
noticed but I was in the elevator with

595
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,570
him one day and I said Oh Charles I see

596
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,400
that you have that new fangled Apple

597
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,169
watch that came out I just saw that

598
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,240
there were some security update about it

599
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:05,880
I will email you the article when I get

600
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,730
back to my office he sent a note to my

601
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,850
boss complimenting me on being proactive

602
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:14,340
and being observant to help solve a

603
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,949
problem that wasn't even in my area of

604
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,899
interest so have an intrapreneurial

605
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,190
spirit or just hi I'm Tracy from the

606
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,350
library I know you work in the

607
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,450
healthcare law department we just got a

608
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,740
bunch of law you know health books you

609
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,690
know I can send you a list when I get

610
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,180
back you know just maybe a quick thing

611
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,400
about yourself or about your department

612
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,200
is this entrepreneurial spirit just a

613
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,120
little elevator pitch of who you are or

614
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,850
what your department does to again be

615
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,379
seen to be approachable to have people

616
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,949
invested in security and know that

617
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,300
there's humans behind it and listening I

618
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,560
know it's really easy if you hear

619
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,600
something like a yeah yeah I know where

620
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,710
this is going and you jump in you need

621
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,560
to listen to the whole story because

622
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,940
there might be plot twists there might

623
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,429
be things that come up that you weren't

624
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,410
anticipating and another skill that you

625
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,210
can try to have is pay attention to what

626
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,190
the user doesn't say and I'll give you

627
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:05,760
an example the users say well I clicked

628
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,860
on a link the page opened up I close the

629
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,530
browser and then I called you I'm like

630
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,330
okay let's start go back there what

631
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:15,120
happened from the time that the page

632
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,710
opened before you closed it sometimes

633
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,209
the answer is oh well I entered my

634
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,860
username and password and nothing

635
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,930
happens so then I closed it and then I

636
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,780
called you like wow that's information I

637
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:26,610
could have used a second ago so an easy

638
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,879
way this is a skill you have to learn

639
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,870
but a tip for this is when you're a

640
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,100
problem-solving or you know doing an

641
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,320
incident response or some sort of

642
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,510
remediation you know what the steps are

643
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,070
to fix the problem in your head so use

644
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:40,500
that as a checklist if someone is

645
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:42,600
telling you a story does this match is

646
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,800
this oh wait we have a gap here now

647
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,750
don't interrupt them because remember

648
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,730
there might be a plot twist later either

649
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,170
write it down or just remember it and

650
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,730
then

651
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,680
well back because that also shows your

652
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,950
listening skills but I cannot tell you

653
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,810
how many times I have zoomed back in on

654
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,390
something that they didn't say and that

655
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,340
was the issue usually enter user name

656
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,590
and password they can Vina Lee leave

657
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:08,780
that information out so sometimes you

658
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:11,570
need to ask directly and again to be

659
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,710
kind is more important to be right many

660
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,620
times what people need is not a

661
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,030
brilliant mind that speaks but a special

662
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,590
heart that listens and I know that

663
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,510
sounds all really touchy-feely and I can

664
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,990
hear eyes rolling again but you get the

665
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,500
point

666
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:26,360
you know you you need to be kind and not

667
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,160
you know tell some user I told you so I

668
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,040
told her that was a luscious eye that

669
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,480
doesn't help anybody need be kind so

670
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,190
let's move to the interviewing step I

671
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,430
already talked about what does the user

672
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,810
not say another thing you can do is you

673
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,750
have to be careful how you ask some of

674
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:43,310
these questions what did you do that's

675
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,160
kind of hard to say in a nice way right

676
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:49,310
so I like to say things what action did

677
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,070
you take okay Bob you clicked on that

678
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:53,389
link what action did you take next and

679
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,120
he'll be like oh well then I looked at

680
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:59,660
the site and I saw it was the office 365

681
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,669
login ok what action did you take next

682
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,380
or what did this thingy that oh you know

683
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,480
what action did you take what hat you

684
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,430
know what happened next I have found

685
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,530
trying to avoid the phrase what did you

686
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:12,230
do because it just sounds it sounds less

687
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,730
accusatory and again you these people

688
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,470
are usually scared sometimes they think

689
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,160
they're going to lose their jobs so you

690
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,440
want to make them feel comfortable

691
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,020
remember create a safe space so just

692
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,380
find other creative ways to maybe ask

693
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:28,010
things about what transpired transpired

694
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:29,120
to use now let's get to the next or

695
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,850
maybe you're trying to search into

696
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,560
things is there a time when maybe your

697
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,000
security failed the end user

698
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,370
maybe it wasn't their fault maybe

699
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,250
something malfunctioned you know there

700
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:42,080
was you know maybe something didn't work

701
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,970
right and it wasn't really their fault

702
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,710
another time helped them connect the

703
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,170
dots of things and I'll give you an

704
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:50,860
example I have story time accounts

705
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:54,560
receivable Rhonda so Rhonda contacted

706
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:56,810
security and got me and she said I have

707
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,879
a brand new task with my job I have to

708
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:00,230
pay invoices and I've been doing it for

709
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,900
a short time

710
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,419
but this one vendor that I've already

711
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,190
paid an invoice for now the invoice

712
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:08,750
looks different and it's been sent to me

713
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,669
in a different way so immediately like

714
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,770
I'm on it this sounds great

715
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:17,419
so it turns out it was one of those like

716
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:20,830
DocuSign links and I used my you know my

717
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:23,120
lab desktop you know to investigate and

718
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:25,100
honestly everything kind of looked on

719
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,870
the up-and-up I was doing all kind again

720
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,370
this talk isn't about remediation but I

721
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,250
was doing all kinds of things so I

722
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:33,379
called Rhonda back and I was like listen

723
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,809
I'm like I can't determine with any

724
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,090
certainty that this is or isn't correct

725
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:40,940
but let's do this I said do you have a

726
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:43,250
phone number for someone at that company

727
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,660
she said oh yeah Joanne I talked to

728
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,700
Joanne all the time and she said I have

729
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,320
her email address and that's when I

730
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,620
helped her on to connect the dots I said

731
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,080
but Rhonda if this company's email is

732
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:57,020
compromised you could be emailing the

733
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,240
criminal she never considered that and I

734
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,620
said so if you know what I said you know

735
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,870
you've talked to Joanne before right she

736
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,030
says oh yeah yeah I'm like okay call her

737
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,979
ask her if they've changed the way that

738
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,570
they've done their invoicing and we'll

739
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,850
go from there so she calls me back like

740
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,530
15 minutes later yes they have

741
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,209
completely changed how they've done

742
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:19,250
their invoicing I was like wow way to go

743
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:20,630
company for a pump--ow but yes and she

744
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,000
confirmed yes that was the invoice we

745
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,620
sent everything was on the up and up and

746
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,210
I've told these people this story to

747
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,699
some people and they're just like well

748
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,770
wasn't that Rhonda's job to looking at

749
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,960
that job Rhonda's jobs on security

750
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,389
Rhonda's job as the pay invoices and

751
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,880
again I praised her for contacting

752
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:41,419
security because this particular invoice

753
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,830
was $1500 next time if it was a fake one

754
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,260
it could have been twenty five thousand

755
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:47,409
dollars or more if she had never stopped

756
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,910
to think something doesn't look right

757
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:53,450
then this could have just perpetuated

758
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:55,220
into a whole B EC cut a stroppy but she

759
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,110
was brave enough to speak up and say

760
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,179
this doesn't look great I'm not really

761
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,229
sure and then she kept apologizing to me

762
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:03,470
because when everything turned out to be

763
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,570
fine I said it's my job you know you did

764
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,190
your job by raising the alert all right

765
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,200
you know we work together to solve it

766
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,320
you did your job and I said if you ever

767
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,830
find invoices that look fishy to you oh

768
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,830
sorry Fi

769
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:21,399
um you know let us know so that was

770
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:23,980
Rhonda and then when you answer them

771
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,140
remember my pleasure to help they didn't

772
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,490
have to contact you you don't say you're

773
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,290
welcome you're not doing them a favor

774
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,600
you're doing your job you know and you

775
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,250
remind people you did a good thing a lot

776
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,500
of times I talk to people who are so

777
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,690
nervous and upset and I remind them you

778
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,180
did a good thing by contacting security

779
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,740
because what's the what what if they

780
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,260
didn't this would blow out it out of

781
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,690
proportion out of control another story

782
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,570
time for you Mike in the wonky Mouse so

783
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:52,330
I get a phone call mike is like so my

784
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,850
mouse isn't working right and I let him

785
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,949
finish and I just very nicely said

786
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:59,530
thought maybe it was an error and I said

787
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,600
okay Mike well you've contacted security

788
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:03,610
did you mean to contact the helpdesk

789
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,209
I'll be happy to transfer me and he goes

790
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:09,010
well I just talked to them and you see I

791
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,380
clicked on a phishing email last week

792
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:14,770
and now this week my mouse is all wonky

793
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,390
I was like well there we go listen now

794
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,040
see what would have happened if I would

795
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,840
have just been like nope not my problem

796
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,129
hot potato back to the helpdesk

797
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,560
this poor guy would have been in a

798
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,760
circle going back and forth and how soon

799
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,950
do you think he would have given up of

800
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,020
like okay nobody wants to help me so I

801
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:32,260
was like oh okay now we have a security

802
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:34,090
issue look into this so I looked into

803
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,040
the email and everything again you know

804
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,020
looked at the logs talked to him did all

805
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,450
this stuff couldn't find anything that

806
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,650
could contribute to the mouse so I'm

807
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,440
like you know I'm doing my best

808
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,960

812
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,469

replicate the issue call me back 15

817
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,390
minutes later he calls me back I am so

818
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,489
sorry to bother you with this and I said

819
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:22,300
it was no bother I said I apologize that

820
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:24,460
the helpdesk couldn't resolve this for

821
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,340
you I said but you did a good thing

822
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,200
because this could have been

823
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,350
a security issue I was thinking his

824
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,760
laptop was compromised okay so he asked

825
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,429
me again he was like how did you figure

826
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:38,160
that out and like I I don't know I don't

827
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:41,250
I took a deep breath and the info said

828
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,910
God's just you know waved a wand and it

829
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,290
just popped him to my head he exactly I

830
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:50,070
don't know why but you know it doesn't

831
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:52,080
matter so what I did though was I was

832
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,520
like hey while I have you on the phone

833
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,460
and you're thinking that I'm all great

834
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,770
and stuff can I show you some red flags

835
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,230
that that email you've clicked on that

836
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:02,730
to avoid this in the future he's like

837
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:07,470
well sure I'll stay on the phone with

838
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:10,290
you so what I constantly had you know

839
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,940
easily available to me were you know

840
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,260
little mock-ups like this this is one

841
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:18,020
from Queen's University in Kingston

842
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,020
Ontario shout-out to my Canadian friends

843
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,700
just just something to show people red

844
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,440
flags I would have this on my desktop

845
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,000
save so if I go let me quickly share my

846
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,460
desktop and I'm gonna walk you through

847
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,990
some red flags may I send this to you

848
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,150
now so that you can keep it

849
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,010
oh yeah so he was very patient he's like

850
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,660
oh you know you're right I should be

851
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,040
more careful like these are great tips

852
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,200
this one I didn't know I didn't know

853
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,700
about hovering blah blah blah while you

854
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,970
have their attention have this at the

855
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,770
ready have something ready again it took

856
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:49,800
me longer to tell this story than it did

857
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:51,030
for me to help him cuz also while he was

858
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,649
off searching for a battery I was

859
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:55,750
working on another problem

860
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:59,320
so let's get you the follow-up now our

861
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,820
last one you know short on time some

862
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,399
things like I already told you have some

863
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,350
pre-canned language or some things you

864
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,600
can send out to people you know just

865
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,790
constantly come up with ways to improve

866
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,709
your user interaction figure out what

867
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,710
works what doesn't work you know

868
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:22,320
think of you know initiatives it is a

869
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,850
cybersecurity Awareness Month maybe talk

870
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,649
to your security awareness team if you

871
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,120
have one or just bring something up

872
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,830
think of ways that you can constantly

873
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,629
innovate because it makes things more

874
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:35,040
interesting for you and it gets your

875
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:37,380
your users engaged I also like to

876
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,960
perform random acts of security kindness

877
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,549
and I what I called the cyber cupcake

878
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,290
because keep in mind outside of our

879
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:47,790
community people think the word cyber is

880
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:49,590
cool and they're impressed by it so I

881
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,780
called this the cyber cupcake it was not

882
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:55,470
this particular cupcake but I would keep

883
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:58,020
a you know like a JPEG of a cupcake on

884
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,780
my desktop and whenever I saw an

885
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:03,389
end-user report a fish that was

886
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,620
particularly sophisticated you know cuz

887
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,000
sometimes you know just as a side note

888
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,250
sometimes you see these fish in there

889
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,168
like you have to be like wow like that

890
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,310
was actually a really skillful fish and

891
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:13,500
other times you look at some of these

892
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,879
emails I'm like criminals take some

893
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,668
pride in your work you know could you

894
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,290
like try a little harder you know here

895
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:22,379
but if you see one that's particularly

896
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:24,869
good and that the user you know flagged

897
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:27,750
it I would send them a cyber cupcake I

898
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:29,879
feel like good job Eagle I reward good

899
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,980
behavior and because I worked in this

900
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:34,020
multinational company I couldn't give

901
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,780
them a literal cupcake a physical

902
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,429
cupcake so I sent them a JPEG people

903
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,770
love that you would have thought I did

904
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:43,290
I've given them a giant check you know

905
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:45,869
like a big like oversized check people

906
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,259
loved it I got replies back you made my

907
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:49,350
day

908
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,330
you made my week I was unsure about that

909
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:55,049
email I was scared to submit it in case

910
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:57,060
I was wrong nothing ever bad happened

911
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,780
for me sending someone a cyber cupcake

912
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,580
okay

913
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,380
it was all good and it was super quick

914
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,810
because it was on my desktop it took me

915
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:07,730
two seconds out of my life and people

916
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,730
loved it so reward good behavior

917
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,410
kindness as a currency and a return on

918
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,930
investment two different ways one story

919
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,879
I'll tell you what snacks every year

920
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,950
around Christmastime and when I was in

921
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,530
the law firm library the librarians and

922
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,790
I would all bake cookies and cakes and

923
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,900
if you've ever follow me on Twitter you

924
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,020
know this is my wheelhouse

925
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,520
we could bake a lot of things and then

926
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,840
we would come in and we would package

927
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,759
them up and we would make these big

928
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,290
cookie trays and then we would march

929
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,390
through the law firm and we would give

930
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:38,910
them to the help desk give them to

931
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,830
accounting give them to facilities give

932
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,930
them to the mailroom all the other

933
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:45,390
departments in our law firm that we

934
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,149
interacted with we gave them you know a

935
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:51,450
gift as a thank-you

936
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:53,820
kindness as a as a currency months later

937
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,470
there would be some some problem that we

938
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,120
would need a lot of help solving and

939
00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:00,089
somebody would go above and beyond

940
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,100
because we constantly showed kindness

941
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:04,440
and I don't mean kindness as a currency

942
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,810
like a bribe but I mean it's you get a

943
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,250
return on investment also if we ever had

944
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,660
lunches you know a lot of vendors would

945
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,130
like to bring in food to the library we

946
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,750
would call other two parts we call the

947
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,360
mailroom guys they're like we got

948
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,670
sandwiches leftover sandwiches come get

949
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,160
it those acts of kindness that we didn't

950
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,630
have to do would come back in ways that

951
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,490
we wouldn't even expect because somebody

952
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,430
would go way above and beyond to help us

953
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,959
for something so it's a it's a currency

954
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,819
so again think about your end users if

955
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,220
you show kindness towards them they're

956
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,020
going to be more apps you want to get

957
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,189
involved in and be a part of security

958
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,660
because they're gonna they're gonna

959
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,430
listen want to listen to you because you

960
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,310
were nice to them and then there's the

961
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,899
luncheon learns you know these these can

962
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,000
also just be brown-bag things if you

963
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,250
don't have any budget but it helps to

964
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,810
even just provide like you know soda and

965
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:51,180
cookies if people bring their own and

966
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,130
you can do presentations but you can

967
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,529
also do this with other departments

968
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:58,530
within your organization you know talk

969
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:00,900
to another tech department what are they

970
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:03,300
doing what are you doing how do your

971
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,880
paths intersect because you you also

972
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,890
want the kindness of your fellow tech

973
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,600
people right the security touches

974
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:12,390
everything whether the other departments

975
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,339
believe it or not you you know do things

976
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,930
to bring them together and this kindness

977
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,900
is you know you're gonna have a return

978
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:23,250
on investment of this kindness

979
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:25,080
so I saw this article and the second if

980
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,860
you replace the word vaccinations with

981
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,560
security

982
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:31,680
I feel like this rings true when it

983
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,779
comes to security I think we have this

984
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,270
optimistic belief that just by telling

985
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:41,090
people facts you can change their

986
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:41,090
behavior that sound true does that sound

987
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:49,920
you need this this isn't really audience

988
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,470
participation there's a rhetorical

989
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,800
question so you've heard and show and

990
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:58,140
tell so instead I want you to tell then

991
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,970
show it's one thing to say to someone

992
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:02,400
you need to use a password manager and

993
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,500
then walk away and think I am an awesome

994
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,480
infoset professional I have just

995
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,780
dispensed and pixie dust unto the world

996
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,270
and it will happen you need to go a

997
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:14,910
little bit further and sometimes you may

998
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,440
not have time for that and I get it but

999
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:20,490
here's a little tip of something you can

1000
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,470
do PC Magazine has a great article where

1001
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,629
they compare password managers side by

1002
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,129
side maybe ten or twelve of them you can

1003
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,720
just say to someone especially if you're

1004
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,730
just like out in public and trying to be

1005
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,430
like helpful info SEC Nancy you know

1006
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:35,160
spreading pixie dust hey you know what

1007
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,890
if you Google PC Mag password managers

1008
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,420
2019 you're going to get this article

1009
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,819
where they list them all side by side

1010
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,370
take a moment to read and see which one

1011
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,930
will work for you isn't that better than

1012
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:49,440
just saying you need to use a password

1013
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:51,240
manager you know or gtfo you know that's

1014
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,460
you know you need to just kind of show

1015
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,140
some people the way if you have more

1016
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,580
time if it's specially internal maybe

1017
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,230
have one of those lunch and learns of

1018
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,120
this is how you set up a password

1019
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,530
manager that is going to go a long way

1020
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,779
than just saying you need to set up a

1021
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,980
password manager and then remember I

1022
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,230
told you how the woman was surprised

1023
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,630
that there was a human and security I

1024
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:12,450
know we all love automation automation

1025
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,160
is is amazing but have you automated

1026
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,919
things so much that people don't think

1027
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,290
there's humans behind it so double check

1028
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,300
or you know again that goes back to do

1029
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,860
people know how to contact you because

1030
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,910
is everything so automated they don't

1031
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:31,280
even know how to get a hold of a human

1032
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:33,379
all right wrap it up let's wrap this up

1033
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,330
okay so originally when I started this

1034
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,210
out remember it was called the reference

1035
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:40,100
interview I have rebranded this for you

1036
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,880
for the information security community

1037
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,069
you're welcome

1038
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,020
I Gail now give you the seven point plan

1039
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,860
for the empathetic InfoSec practitioner

1040
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:50,509
it's the same seven bullet points but

1041
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:53,060
rebranded for your enjoyment to make

1042
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,710
sure that it it pertains to your world

1043
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,049
so let's let's check in on our little

1044
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:59,480
play here so the person on the left our

1045
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:02,300
end user says I understand phishing now

1046
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,250
exclamation point and the infamous

1047
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:09,110
InfoSec professional on the right says

1048
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:10,940
my pleasure to help now let's go back

1049
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:13,070
for a second remember I told you these

1050
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,120
are some of my parting thoughts I told

1051
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,770
you that people are gonna work your

1052
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:20,299
nerves right for dinner I get it I get

1053
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:22,240
it sometimes this is difficult to try

1054
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:25,070
and be empathetic and approachable I

1055
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,839
want you to have a mantra I always got

1056
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:30,110
upset in the sock when when my

1057
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:33,290
co-workers would effing users this and

1058
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,970
expletive expletive that I would take a

1059
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:37,279
deep breath and channel my inner

1060
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:39,799
Southern woman and now that we are here

1061
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,420
in the South this is appropriate and if

1062
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,330
they did something that we would call

1063
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:47,570
stupid I would say bless their heart for

1064
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:49,490
trying now don't get me wrong I am very

1065
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,760
well aware that bless their heart isn't

1066
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:55,580
exactly a nice thing to say

1067
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,640
however it is a not nice thing to say

1068
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:00,049
said in a nice way

1069
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,210
remember I said about what did you do

1070
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:04,910
kind of sounds accusatory and versus

1071
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,770
what action did you take next this is

1072
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:10,129
the what action did you take next

1073
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:11,870
version of saying something else

1074
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,270
negative about a user so I would just

1075
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:16,640
take a deep breath bless their hearts

1076
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:18,890
for trying and then just dig into it so

1077
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,540
since we are here in the South I want

1078
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,009
you all to dig deep channel your inner

1079
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,900
southern woman on the count of three I

1080
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,180
want you to say bless their hearts one

1081
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:29,390
two three

1082
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:31,440
excellent thank you you're halfway there

1083
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:34,170
so now you might be like well why should

1084
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,980
I care about a culture of security let

1085
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,619
me tell you about the sugar-bowl

1086
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,810
principle so you drop a sugar bowl say

1087
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:41,730
on your kitchen floor the ceramic pieces

1088
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:44,310
go everywhere the sugar goes everywhere

1089
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:46,680
and you have two choices you can either

1090
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:48,359
clean it up right away get everything

1091
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,899
all spic and span like nothing ever

1092
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:52,319
happened

1093
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:54,060
or you can leave it and it can sit any

1094
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,950
confessor and maybe people are cutting

1095
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,569
themselves on the ceramics or the sugar

1096
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,669
starting to get up underneath the tile

1097
00:41:57,569 --> 00:42:02,700
and you're getting ants and it's so

1098
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:05,460
spread out it's a bigger mess what's

1099
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:09,000
houses Carlita security I would rather

1100
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,250
have an end user reach out to me at 1159

1101
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,079
before I'm about to go to lunch and I

1102
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:16,230
have to eat lunch at my desk to fix a

1103
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:18,990
problem versus them saying nothing

1104
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:22,020
and an alert going off at 4:59 on a

1105
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:23,939
holiday weekend which and I have to stay

1106
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,890
and fix something because nobody said

1107
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,869
anything but if they had said something

1108
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,839
or sooner because we were approachable

1109
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:32,400
we could have been remediated it I can't

1110
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:35,670
think of an easier way to explain why

1111
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,040
having your users not fear you is better

1112
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:40,440
I'm okay eating lunch at my desk I

1113
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,810
usually did it anyway but it's a holiday

1114
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,220
weekend I want to go I don't want to sit

1115
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,680
there on a Friday night working on this

1116
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:50,250
one Halloween I said in my driveway with

1117
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:52,259
my laptop working on an issue and handed

1118
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,569
out candy while I was remaining on the

1119
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,690
other hand that wasn't so fun

1120
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:58,950
I'd rather work through lunch so

1121
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:00,270
sugar-bowl principle you want people to

1122
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,859
feel comfortable you want to be

1123
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,869
approachable to come to you to let you

1124
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:05,730
know when things happen rather than be

1125
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:06,960
surprised when nothing you know when

1126
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:08,609
nobody says anything and then be

1127
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,910
surprised when something goes chaos

1128
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:12,839
chaotic on your network another reason

1129
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:15,390
why I should care about a culture

1130
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,310
security is security departments are a

1131
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:21,000
cost center and if you're not familiar

1132
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:22,950
with that term bless your heart it's the

1133
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,589
opposite of a profit Center profit

1134
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:28,828
Center makes a company money and usually

1135
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:30,750
is kind of left alone but a security is

1136
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:34,410
usually a cost center meaning you cost

1137
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:36,900
money so one way that you want to kind

1138
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,350
of endear yourself to a company is to be

1139
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,060
better at these things

1140
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,100
of customer service so that you can

1141
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,509
prove your worth as a call center now

1142
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,730
some of you may be looking at me and

1143
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,230
going lady did she just tweet in June

1144
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,990
that you got laid off and you've been

1145
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:53,500
doing Hovis yes I did get laid off in

1146
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:55,509
June however how was I able to get

1147
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,450
another really cool job that I can't

1148
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:00,370
talk about yet so quickly because I was

1149
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,589
able to talk about all the innovations I

1150
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:08,080
did all the initiatives I spearheaded

1151
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:10,570
all the things I was able to do using

1152
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,759
the 7 step principle all my interviews I

1153
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,170
talked about it I was able to land on my

1154
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,090
feet because of something out of my

1155
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:21,190
control because of all these skills so

1156
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:23,800
I'm not a hypocrite and again why should

1157
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:25,780
you care about culture security kindness

1158
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,760
is a currency and again I mean this in a

1159
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:30,070
positive way things will come back to

1160
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,990
you returns on investment it is in your

1161
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:34,540
best interest as an individual and as a

1162
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:36,580
department to exercise kindness and

1163
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:39,190
empathy towards our end users because

1164
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,840
it's going to go a long way to having a

1165
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:43,030
culture security where people are

1166
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,160
excited to report things I had some

1167
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,420
users that were so eager to report

1168
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,370
things all the time sometimes I'd be

1169
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:52,900
like whoa slow down I don't care this

1170
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:55,029
much nothing's wrong nothing bad is

1171
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,920
going to happen from being kind and some

1172
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:59,200
people might be like well you know

1173
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,100
kindness is a is a weak thing that's

1174
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:06,339
being weak Oh contraire tenderness and

1175
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:09,790
kindness are not signs of weakness and

1176
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:12,520
despair but manifestations of strength

1177
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,259
and resolution so if you can get

1178
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,500

1179

1190
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,130
hands in the back you want to come up

1191

1194
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:11,599
question was asking if thank you see

1195

1196
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,210

1197
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:20,300
