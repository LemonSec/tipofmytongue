1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:11,719
thank you Jason well shall we get

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,719
started

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,759
all right I guess it's about time to get

4
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,759
started

5
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:24,300
hi I'm Lee Neely this panel is on the

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,130
five things we wish users would stop

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:33,270
doing we have assembled an awesome group

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,969
here of some of the finest female IT

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,680
professionals I know or pretend to know

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,050
and I was going to let them introduce

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,460
themselves but the continent the concept

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,260
here is we all have situations that

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,430
users do unusual things that we wish

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,949
they wouldn't that are counterproductive

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,590
to business or themselves and I was

16
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,839
talking to my wife Shelly about this

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:00,989
idea and from a male perspective I'm

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,930
like okay let's fix the problem and then

19
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:07,710
maybe go to public shaming and she's

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,630
like no no education is a better move so

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,139
what we want to do is talk about the

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,850
five things that users do that we wish

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,500
they wouldn't a little bit about why we

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,320
believe they do them and what we can do

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,790
to help them choose better but before we

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,869
start I want to pass the mic let the

27
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,640
panelists introduce themselves hi I'm

28
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:32,729
Leslie Carhartt otherwise known as

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,799
pancakes hello and I have been doing IT

30
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,929
for a little over 20 years I've been

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,540
doing security for about 12 years

32
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,400
my focus is industrial control system

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,079
cybersecurity shameless plug I'm

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,850
speaking on that at six but this is

35
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:51,360
going to be more fun I'm Shelly Clements

36
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,240
this is my baby I had gone to a series

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,310
of issa meetings and there seemed to be

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,189
a theme that everybody kept going

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,229
I had these users that did this I want

40
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,139
to shoot him I had users that did that I

41
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,270
want to shoot him and when he was going

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,209
G what do I want to do this year I go

43
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,650
education so that's how this came about

44
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:15,480
I also have been an IT for over 20 years

45
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,099
I went from blowing up which was a

46
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,119
heck of a lot more fun in some ways to

47
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:23,879
going back to school and getting a

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,200
degree in computer science and working

49
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:31,018
on cybersecurity I want to stand up

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:36,899
since the table is really short hey hi I

51
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:39,720
remember right I hi I do right now I do

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,099
like application security and education

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:47,040
of people and just in general from

54
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:50,700
developers to users to parents to kids

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,650
to whoever can possibly learn about how

56
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,569
to use technology more securely I

57
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,220
Jason Street and I run a class that is

58
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:01,319
about building a security awareness

59
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,579
program it's called achieving security

60
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,388
awareness through social engineering

61
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:08,670
attacks where we demonstrate how to use

62
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,170
like some hack hack 5 tools and ocean

63
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,869
and some other things to demonstrate

64
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,298
vulnerability to to people so they

65
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:30,440
actually understand the risk rather than

66
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:35,699
having it be a theoretical thing mr. I

67
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:37,919

just for the rounded out I'm Lee Neely

79
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,710
I'm in cybersecurity over at Lawrence

80
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,080
Livermore Lab been over there for 30

81
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,080

Directors sans news bite editor little

85
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,230
things anyway so why don't we kick it

86
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:52,190
off with what we think our number one

87
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:54,140
issue is and you know actually before I

88
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,600
go there how many of you guys know about

89
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:00,590
the xkcd password that they just were

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,060
hacked 560,000 records do you know what

91
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:06,940
the number one password that was in the

92
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:13,430
dump was do you know what number two was

93
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:20,540
correct battery horse staple and with

94
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:24,560
that who would like to kick it off okay

95
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:26,030
so my yes okay so my number one thing

96
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:32,150
that I think that users should stop

97
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:34,099
doing that the user should stop doing is

98
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,440
over sharing on social media I am so

99
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,750
passionate about this like people will

100
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,370
just talk about anything they post

101
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,690
pictures of their kids of their public

102
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,350
profile pictures even though their

103
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,880
profiles are locked down they they share

104
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,250
their home phone numbers and addresses

105
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,800
they share pictures of their kids doing

106
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,419
it's at school like these are really

107
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,070
scary things that people shouldn't be

108
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,419
doing okay sorry these are really scary

109
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,830
things that people shouldn't be doing

110
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,560
but they don't really understand the

111
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,859
threats or why they shouldn't be doing

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,750
it

113
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,570
but over sharing on social media just

114
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,660
becomes this huge problem for the

115
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:12,020
company because if you can get to the

116
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,320
user or you know their their phone or

117
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,430
their personal computer or figuring a

118
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,070
lot more about them then you can

119
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,169
Spearfish them you can you can maybe get

120
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,940
into a phone and then get into a network

121
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,409
when it's plugged in so there's there's

122
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,870
a lot of different reasons why that's a

123
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,620
problem not just for the company but for

124
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,620
the users themselves

125
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,950
my top and my number three keep bouncing

126
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:42,849
back and forth depending on what's going

127
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:47,680
on users opening mail from parties

128
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:52,180
unknown and weak passwords how many of

129
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,390
you saw the last spider-man movie what

130
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,910
was happy Hogan's password on his cell

131
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:03,700
phone

132
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:06,520
passwords no I did - I did - and and

133
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,640
it's something that keeps coming up and

134
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,799
it was also twenty years ago when I

135
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,760
started in this field a lot of what I

136
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,790
was working with was passwords and there

137
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,039
were certain programs that you can force

138
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:25,150
on people to choose a more difficult

139
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,220
password I don't know the one that I had

140
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,719
that was screw my ex number one or

141
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,310
something like that I thought was pretty

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:39,580
good but you know seriously it was and

143
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:42,310
the word was not screw but trying to

144
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,820
help people I was really happy several

145
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,640
months ago when it came out that little

146
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,090
sayings were actually really helpful for

147
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,610
people to remember because I don't know

148
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,200
about you guys but right now based on

149
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,180
what some of the companies where my

150
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,460
credit cards are my checking accounts

151
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:03,940
are some of the other things that I

152
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:06,849
belong to I've got a really long

153
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,710
spreadsheet on my machine that has all

154
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:12,040
these different passwords because what

155
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,620
works perfectly well one area you know

156
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:20,490
there's different requirements and it's

157
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,490
really hard to keep all of them in track

158
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,109
sure and it doesn't want it I don't okay

159
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,869
so I'm going to turn that on its head a

160
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,310
little bit so my number one might my top

161
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,260
one is not speaking up when there's a

162
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,750
problem and there's a number of reasons

163
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,460
why I say that is the first one is you

164
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,780
see the phishing email or the obvious

165
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,099
thing you clicked on something and you

166
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,870
don't tell your security team because

167
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,700
you're embarrassed or something but the

168
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,450
the other take on that is not telling us

169
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,860
secure

170
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,050
people when we're doing something wrong

171
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,940
because we have all these like these

172
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,620
these tropes that we keep telling people

173
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,510
over and over again like use a strong

174
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,490
password use a password manager and

175
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,840
stuff and sometimes those are really

176
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,250
tricky things to do like have you ever

177
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,080
tried to convert all of your passwords

178
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,270
saved in a bunch of browsers and stuff

179
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,640
or somebody else's to a password manager

180
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,890
that's not an intuitive process that's

181
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,930
really really hard to do so I would like

182
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,110
to see more end users telling their

183
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:13,810
security people to go F themselves like

184
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,640
but seeing it just like you know telling

185
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,140
us what's wrong telling us I can't use a

186
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,280
password manager because here's the

187
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:33,880
problem yeah I definitely give us some

188
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:35,199
explanation you want to fight so I feel

189
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,550
like I'm at a disadvantage because I

190
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,940
don't actually deal with users anymore

191
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,939
I'm a nut that's not a disadvantage so

192
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:51,190
I'm gonna use my user base as an example

193
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:53,470
because I do MSSP stuff so I think like

194
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,050
my users are sysadmin x' and net admins

195
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,410
and security admins like at corporations

196
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,880
right and I think their biggest mistake

197
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:04,120
and I hope this doesn't like off rail

198
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,439
anybody else's like things but it is not

199
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,560
understanding a sim isn't a magic

200
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,600
solution that you can just install and

201
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,119
you can send logs at and boom you're

202
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,310
just gonna it's gonna it's going to be

203
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,840
done you have active security alerting

204
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,819
you're gonna catch all of the threats

205
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,610
and all of the red team activity and

206
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,840
it's just you know in there in a couple

207
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,310
days and you're done no it's like a

208
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:30,790
process right an ongoing process that

209
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:32,260
you have to keep revisiting as you know

210
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,939
if you have an MSP or if you do it

211
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,860
internally you know it's that's that's

212
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,510
gonna be someone's full-time job that's

213
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,980
not something that you can just like oh

214
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,280
I'm gonna install an anti-virus and

215
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,380
we're done no it's it's something that

216
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,760
you needed to treat as less of a project

217
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,760
and more of just an ongoing thing

218
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,470
well actually what I was gonna ask for

219
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,079
our panelists is the out you've named

220
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,540
your number one what can we do to help

221
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,280
users do the right thing and make the

222
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,410
right choices I mean I love the idea of

223
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,329
speak up when we cyber people are being

224
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,069
unreasonable although we get a pretty

225
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:14,390
good feedback loop at the lab they are

226
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:16,280
not shy it is often called the smartest

227
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:20,330
square mile on the planet and they know

228
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:22,220
it and they don't read they'll read the

229
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,960
first sentence I mean that's only my

230
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,820
users right read the first sentence and

231
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:33,200
a half of the email and and and ignore

232
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:40,730
the rest we we get we've give them

233
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:42,170
cookies so so yeah so and whether you're

234
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,080
directly dealing with users or your

235
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:49,099
users are the CEO who who believe in

236
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:53,540
that in the magic unicorn solution with

237
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,220
rainbows coming out of you know we're so

238
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,839
I'll pass the bike back down like I said

239
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,360
I'd like to see your ideas on how we can

240
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:05,540
how we can move the bar how we can how

241
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:07,070
we can how we can do stuff okay so I had

242
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,050
another one actually on here that's kind

243
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,490
of falls into that that falls directly

244
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,120
into that so forgetting that they can

245
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:16,400
contribute to security so as a solution

246
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,900
I think remembering that they have

247
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,280
expertise that they can bring to the

248
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,680
security space and I'm in industrial

249
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,630
control systems now and I'm dealing with

250
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,760
a lot of eclectic legacy systems you

251
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,410
know from the 70s and 80s and the people

252
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,910
who know those systems the best are the

253
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:30,170
guys who have been there for 30 years or

254
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,390
the girls who have been there for 30

255
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,890
years and you know those industrial

256
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,020
systems is infrastructure systems

257
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,340
amazingly well they might not know

258
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,460
everything about security but they could

259
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,710
be very interested in it and I'd like as

260
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,180
a solution to those problems to have

261
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,100
users remember that they can contribute

262
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,209
to security and there are elements of

263
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:53,090
knowledge that they bring to the table

264
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:55,580
that we don't have when I notice some of

265
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:57,790
these things happening when I was

266
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:01,790
working on this special information

267
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:03,170
project the boss originally had been the

268
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,790
one who was trying to

269
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,949
trained people and what they needed to

270
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:11,329
do here's step one step two step three

271
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:14,510
and I saw people that were just glazing

272
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:16,790
over in his classes and I came out of

273
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:20,389
one of them and told him flat out I go

274
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,849
I'm taking over training and I'm gonna

275
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:25,910
be working one-on-one with people we

276
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,769
went from 65 to over 650 when I had left

277
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,170
the program and those were people that

278
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:32,810
were using the system at least weekly

279
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:36,560
and they knew what to do because I would

280
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:40,670
sit down with them and go this is what I

281
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,619
need and let's let's work here and if I

282
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,540
saw their eyes starting to glaze over

283
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,029
it's like okay let's use another word

284
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:52,670
because I was working with PhD

285
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:56,779
physicists chemists Neer's mechanical

286
00:13:52,670 --> 00:14:00,829
engineers chemists computer security

287
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:04,420
people scientists of all kind and and I

288
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:08,000
learned you have to also sometimes have

289
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:10,729
an unique language for each of them how

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,230
you explain thing to a physicist is not

291
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:19,100
how you're going to explain it to a

292
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:21,230
chemist and by working one-on-one we the

293
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,940
problems that we had with security with

294
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,480
what was happening with the passwords

295
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,480
what was happening with sign-ons

296
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,370
this is on the classified side of course

297
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,880
really dropped down during my tenure

298
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:39,019
there because I knew what they were

299
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,459
doing yeah so I'm gonna keep standing

300
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:47,209
and making it awkward for everybody else

301
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:49,219
at the panel okay so so over sharing on

302
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:51,529
social media the reason people use

303
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,410
social media is to share things it's

304
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:57,110
very counterintuitive but I think that

305
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:00,260
one of the things that we can do as a

306
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:03,250
company is to actually has a couple of

307
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:06,829
advantages so by training our employees

308
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,810
about how to protect their families and

309
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:12,410
how to protect themselves outside of

310
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:15,529
work we they will take those principles

311
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,699
we show them about oversharing or show

312
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:18,710
them about how ascent works

313
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,210
spearfishing works and and how to look

314
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:24,020
at their kids phones and look for apps

315
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,310
that hide their their fenced of accounts

316
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,260
or whatever like they're fake Instagram

317
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,369
accounts they have one for that their

318
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,710
parents see and one that everybody else

319
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,060
sees how to look for those apps it's a

320
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,450
calculator but they're really like

321
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,119
Instagram how to configure their

322
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,340
wireless routers how to set up guest

323
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,020
networks how to set up a VPN on their

324
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,550
phone like by teaching them how to

325
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,160
protect themselves it makes it relevant

326
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,959
to them and then they retain that

327
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,030
information and better they will become

328
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,680
advocates for other people's like their

329
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:54,079
friends and family which is you know

330
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,640
good for society but they will also take

331
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,850
that information and bring it back to

332
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,600
the company and they will you still have

333
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,890
that knowledge that they learned from

334
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,320
about how to protect themselves and

335
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:09,800
hopefully apply it back to the company

336
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,450
so oh I mean they're good they're always

337
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,650
going to share stuff but we can show

338
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,570
them how to lock down their privacy

339
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,970
settings we can show them things that

340
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,920
are relevant to them and what tell them

341
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,840
why and talk to them about the threats

342
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,640
and what can happen as a result then

343
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,960
make it personal because if we're not

344
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,670
making security personal to them they're

345
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,170
not gonna care because they do not care

346
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:36,020
about your data they care about their

347
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:38,180
data I'm gonna lay down instead of up so

348
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,189
going back to the magic stem problem I

349
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,109
say work closer with your security

350
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:46,460
vendors and all your other vendors

351
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:49,040
straight they're usually there to help

352
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,070
you accomplish some stuff and you are

353
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,790
paying them keep them accountable you

354
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:59,390
know actually work through you know the

355
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:01,910
implementation and don't just stop there

356
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,129
you know make sure they're continuously

357
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:07,329
working on it and not just installing

358
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,330
and forgetting it as well

359
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,170
do you number two yeah so we don't have

360
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,450
to I don't know I like passing the mic

361
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:20,030
all the way down no it's okay I'll do

362
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:23,410
number two to trying to think in order

363
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:27,349
because I just randomly wrote these down

364
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:29,690
I'd say installing like next-gen

365
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,379
firewalls without actually configuring

366
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:37,130
anything

367
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:39,800
is number two so yeah they have a

368
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:43,190
firewall on their perimeter and you know

369
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,740
whatever threat list stuff they have on

370
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,060
there there's lowing everything so it

371
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,190
doesn't really matter anyways and they

372
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,570
put all those any-any rules and you know

373
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:55,460
all their outbound traffic is allowed

374
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:57,080
and I see it all the time also kind of

375
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,930
like the second step down from that

376
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,929
would be just denying things when you're

377
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,940
you know soccer your MSSP tell you hey

378
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,290
this is a bad idea dress that you're

379
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,680
contacting and then they'll just block

380
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,629
that IP address from being accessed yeah

381
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,460
so like lack of configuration on that

382
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:17,360
really expensive equipment that they put

383
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:19,880
in and you know it's not like they need

384
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,740
to be pros you know that you don't have

385
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,990
to be a network engineer I mean you

386
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,260
should to put it in I guess but if you

387
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,520
if that's not your full-time gig you

388
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,280
know and you have somebody else doing

389
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,629
that for you you know making sure

390
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:41,410
there's audits and everything in place

391
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:44,360
as well okay so I think my number two is

392
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,180
over trusting the technology that's

393
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,040
designed to protect them so so we put

394
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,840
things in place we put block lists and

395
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:55,490
blacklist in place we put block list in

396
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:59,480
place we we put all these things we put

397
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,700
a subject lines and say external we we

398
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,720
we teach them we do all of these other

399
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,890
things but but a lot of people are

400
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,570
feeling like they're more protected than

401
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:14,630
they really are if we teach them about

402
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:17,629
the failings of what the technology is

403
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:20,570
that is designed to protect them and we

404
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:22,160
we say okay it does say external but if

405
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,740
somebody's account was compromised it

406
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,360
still could be coming from internal so

407
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,850
you still have to be aware even though

408
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,270
that header is there that shows you that

409
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:35,959
the email is external so I think that

410
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:38,710
just but the problem is I think I just

411
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,710
gave a solution to

412
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,790
but yeah I think just like the blinky

413
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,070
boxes are great and everything but it's

414
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:48,399
really education that is going to help

415
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,929
solve the problems of the users it's not

416
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,600
putting in a bunch of things to protect

417
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:55,250
them like putting them in a rubber room

418
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,780
it's it's teaching them that things are

419
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:02,390
sharp and things are hot and that they

420
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:06,530
shouldn't touch them so I'm going to go

421
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:08,930
back to basics a little bit here how

422
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,879
many of you still have users that are

423
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:16,910
opening email from people that they

424
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:20,800
don't know and how many of them continue

425
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:24,650
to click on a link within that email and

426
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:28,850
they're doing it and it's what can we do

427
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:31,520
there is a friend of mine I was bouncing

428
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,830
this presentation off of and he said the

429
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,540
company that he has worked for for the

430
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:43,820
last maybe ten years has the entire

431
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:46,879
company go through training like every

432
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:50,149
three months and he goes you know I've

433
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,190
been going in hit read question you know

434
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,610
just going through it he goes it's just

435
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:58,100
now after several years that some of

436
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,899
this stuff is really starting to sink in

437
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,780
and this is a guy that's been doing this

438
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:07,730
quarterly at least it's sinking in come

439
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:10,399
on right and it's and it's finding

440
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,990
where's a better training program and

441
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,270
that's something like you know okay I

442
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,690
was doing one on one which was really

443
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:20,330
helpful I worked at Lawrence Livermore

444
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:24,380
trying to do one on one with 6,000

445
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:30,199
people is just a hair daunting for doing

446
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:32,780
it and having if they click on that

447
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,820
fishing link if the company is sending

448
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,610
out as part of their training program

449
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,040
and it's oh you just wound up in you

450
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,580
know phishing prison for this okay how

451
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,889
much is that teaching them but it is

452
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:50,510
helping I don't think it's as bad as it

453
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:52,880
was 10 15 years ago but the cyber

454
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:55,360
security expert at the end of the table

455
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,360
I know better

456
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,270
alright so I think my second one would

457
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:04,129
be people not demanding privacy and

458
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,300
security from various vendors that

459
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,460
affect their lives especially in their

460
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,070
personal lives we're in the land of

461
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,740
smart everything we're in the land of

462
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,000
cloud connected everything social media

463
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,060
everything we're putting our data

464
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,100
everywhere and it's everything from with

465
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,560
how long did I sleep last night to like

466
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,990
very personal stuff about your kids your

467
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,730
health you know every every aspect of

468
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,080
your life is monitored from the moment

469
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,370
you're born now it's all posted to the

470
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,020
Internet it's all tracked by credit

471
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,780
agencies and health companies and and

472
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,760
all these smart vendors and nobody's

473
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,350
demanding security and these devices

474
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,390
they're demanding cheap they're

475
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:41,090
demanding quick and available they are

476
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,890
not devant demanding secure and private

477
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,149
and nobody's reading those long privacy

478
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,190
policies and so what that's our fault

479
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,710
for not making sure that those privacy

480
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,060
policies are legible to users that needs

481
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,340
to be legislated that needs to be

482
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:56,149
something that's established across the

483
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:59,120
board in our in our countries but yeah

484
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,890
that needs to come from consumers but

485
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,000
that type of legislative change we can

486
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,740
only do so much as security

487
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,980
professionals I'd like to see consumers

488
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,960
out there saying I want my data to have

489
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,390
some semblance of privacy I want to have

490
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,520
the ability to say no like we saw in the

491
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,590
EU you know as some attempts at least to

492
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,680
let people say no I don't want my data

493
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,909
to share it so yeah I'd like to see more

494
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,230
of that I'd like to see people care a

495
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,940
little bit more about that instead of

496
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:30,410
getting the cheapest smart coffeemaker

497
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:32,330
they can that that actually was

498
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,200
reminding me that I don't think the

499
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:40,429
average consumer is asking should we

500
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:44,260
it's shiny it's new it's cool sign me up

501
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:46,490
I'll take two I'll take a thousand the

502
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,260
interesting thing about the the social

503
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,080
media people posted up so I was flashing

504
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,730
back how many you have had friends who

505
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,040
basically almost posted from the

506
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:58,120
hospital the full name date and time of

507
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,120
birth of the newborn

508
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,409
do you think that might be useful later

509
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:08,120
and do you think it disappears once it's

510
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:10,260
posted I don't think the average person

511
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,229
really think we saw we saw a

512
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,330
cybersecurity professionals we get it I

513
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,070
don't know how to cap the users get that

514
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,990
pretty much once it's online you can

515
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,010
find it I mean teaching them about

516
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:24,060
teaching about Osen is one way but I

517
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:26,850
don't know how many eye glazes you get

518
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:29,120
on at Joe average I don't know what we

519
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:32,340
can do but I'd love to see us do more

520
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:38,729
but anyway so we're ready for ready for

521
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:41,730
our next one okay I guess there going to

522
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,990
be other direction no sorry so you know

523
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,420
I want to follow up on something that

524
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,950
Amanda brought up earlier and I think

525
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,810
we've we've all kind of got this on our

526
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,570
list which is the the take on the

527
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:53,970
expecting perfect security from devices

528
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,350
and security products that we I think I

529
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,180
think we probably all have something to

530
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,679
that effect on our lists so I'll just

531
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,390
elaborate on that a little bit more it's

532
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,730
not even just buying the magic black

533
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,010
next-generation box that is supposed to

534
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,290
do security for us it's expecting any

535
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:09,390
product out there to just do perfect

536
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:11,399
security and not understanding that

537
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,500
everybody will ultimately be vulnerable

538
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,510
to fishing and to a breach and it's just

539
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,060
you can reduce the risk

540
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,740
there's defense-in-depth you increase

541
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,179
the deterrence in your network to try to

542
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,130
keep more and more adversaries out but

543
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,510
there was an instructor in college who

544
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,560
told me a wonderful parable that's

545
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,410
really stuck with me and a lot of

546
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,450
colleges has gone away but uh-huh so

547
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:33,210
this this telecom guy said so if you

548
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,800
have a house you put like you put a door

549
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,480
in the house right and that keeps like

550
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,610
the neighborhood kids from just walking

551
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,750
in and out of your house right they

552
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,830
don't they see the doors closed they

553
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,750
don't walk in and then you put a

554
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,179
deadbolt on that door and the deadbolt

555
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,430
that like deters the casuals thief from

556
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,750
like just opening trying your door and

557
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,910
seeing if they can walk in and steer at

558
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,410
steal your TV and then you maybe put an

559
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,300
alarm system you put ADT out there or

560
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,620
something and that deters the more

561
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,360
dedicated people who are ready to throw

562
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,489
a brick through your window but if

563
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,320
somebody is paying $10,000 to hire a

564
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,690
hitman to kill you guess what that guy

565
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,580
is doing that that hitman is coming in

566
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,060
and killing you you're gonna die I'm

567
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,419
sorry

568
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,860
uh-huh I'm sorry guys and Security's

569
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,110
like that it's like you mean we build

570
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,799
layers of defense in depth

571
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:17,240
we deter and we deter and we deter but

572
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,710
we people have to understand that there

573
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:28,880
you have to plan for that worst-case

574
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:31,640
scenario yes you know what he gave me

575
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:36,170
for my birthday a really nice Kimber

576
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,470
micro 9 concealed carry and I'll show

577
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:41,120
you what I can do with it

578
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:45,710
well no it's back at the house come on

579
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:49,850
out come on out yeah kind of going along

580
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:51,650
with that is you also do you have users

581
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,799
that are going places they shouldn't go

582
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:58,100
and sometimes it's unintentional years

583
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,049
ago there there's a place out in Manteca

584
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,280
anybody from California you've heard of

585
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:07,129
Manteca RV sales or whatever the hell

586
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,678
people at lunchtime would go out there

587
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:12,290
to see about renting an RV and then it

588
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,640
turned out on the back end everything

589
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,389
that they were putting in there was

590
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:20,000
being sent to Russia

591
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:22,790
seriously it was and the lab thought

592
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:32,299
they had everything dialed down really

593
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:34,040
tight and it was yeah but there's there

594
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:37,970
sites that are even worse

595
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:40,850
we have personally a friend that never

596
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:43,880
found a site he didn't want to go to and

597
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:47,149
there was there was a about a year there

598
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:50,000
that every three months this guy's

599
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:53,570
computer was being brought over to our

600
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,750
house and can you please clean this up

601
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:59,928
just one more time because of what was

602
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:02,030
happening and and I can't tell you how

603
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:06,590
many hours I spent working with this guy

604
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:08,330
going you can't do this and oh no he was

605
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:12,350
a professional at Johnson & Johnson and

606
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:17,879
he knew everything so that was pretty

607
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:23,189
not great okay so

608
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:27,530
um whatever three three okay okay all

609
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:30,990
right number three I think that um that

610
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,760
people are not willing to put themselves

611
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:36,299
in uncomfortable situations and they're

612
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:40,140
not willing to deviate from cultural

613
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:43,530
norms so the the idea that it's rude to

614
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,890
not hold the door for somebody is a

615
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:50,940
reason the piggybacking occurs it

616
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:53,460
without feeling empowered to you can

617
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,809
hold the door for someone and teach them

618
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,690
you can hold the door but then ask to

619
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:59,850
see their badge or or watch to make sure

620
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,580
that they go over to security to as a

621
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:05,549
guest or something like that so so being

622
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,100
polite without without compromising

623
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:09,780
security I think that if if you're not

624
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,189
willing to put yourself in an

625
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,840
uncomfortable situation if you're not

626
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,010
willing to ask for help if you're not

627
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,059
willing to go to security and say I

628
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,620
don't know what to do about the

629
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:18,928
situation I got this email should I open

630
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,428
it or there's a person downstairs and I

631
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:23,100
saw them come in and they didn't use it

632
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:27,000
bad what should I do

633
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,649
getting over that that ego and I mean

634
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,419
this is a very hard thing to fix but

635
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,919
it's a it's a culture thing it's an

636
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:34,159
education thing as a training thing

637
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,720
where you have to make sure that people

638
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,840
understand that they have the power to

639
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:47,520
make or break the security controls that

640
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:51,330
you have in place nice I think my number

641
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:56,220
three is not not teaming up your red and

642
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:57,689
blue team contractors together it even

643
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,880
if you have them internally like if you

644
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:02,460
have a red team blue team internally I'm

645
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,580
not doing purple teaming so I'll see a

646
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,260
lot of times like so I do all blue

647
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,480
team's stuff you know one of our

648
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,270
customers like oh you know we had a pen

649
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,980
test or we're going to have a pen test

650
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,809
and then never hear what the results of

651
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,990
the report were you know we may get a

652
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:22,408
hey you didn't catch this but there's no

653
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:25,260
real communication going back and forth

654
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:28,110
between the two teams I think some of it

655
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,158
is the vendors maybe not being cool with

656
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,559
it because they don't want to like

657
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,710
release what their secrets are or

658
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:36,690
you know any information about you know

659
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:41,039
the insider Network I don't I don't know

660
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:43,139
you kind of already have it but it it

661
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,360
it's a really big problem when it comes

662
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:47,820
to doing defensive stuff because we

663
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,939
can't you know fix what we don't know is

664
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:54,210
broken especially when you're you know a

665
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:56,700
contractor MSSP or whatever because you

666
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,679
don't know you know the networks and and

667
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,019
everything that they have internally as

668
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:11,119
well as you know red teamer that broke

669
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:15,559
in or their internal team for the record

670
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,559
Shelley's a much better shot than I am

671
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:23,090
just and and my friends have advised me

672
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:25,529
never piss her off if she has a weapon

673
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:29,009
in general it's a good that's bet you

674
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:30,509
can leave off the last part it works I'm

675
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:32,039
reminded we have a lot of awareness

676
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:34,649
training at Lawrence Livermore because

677
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,759
we do have some secured spaces and I

678
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:38,428
know some of the people in the audience

679
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,629
here are excellent at social engineering

680
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,490
they're into where they where they

681
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:42,840
aren't supposed to be and I have from

682
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,789
time to time wondered how well they do

683
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,470
out there and I don't mean that in a

684
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:48,539
negative way I mean that at a respect

685
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,899
because there's some damn good people

686
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:53,460
that do this stuff and I'm thinking

687
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:55,498
about a company that doesn't do as much

688
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,039
awareness and have as much perimeter

689
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:59,749
security

690
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:04,200
it's got to be toast for a lot of them

691
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:08,159
but you know well you just educate pick

692
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,869
your risks right so those are our top

693
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,950
three I think we want to we want to go

694
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:18,749
for one more we got got enough time so

695
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:23,070
I'll hand it over all right so I think

696
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:25,110
my last one is so arthur c clarke once

697
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,610
said anything that's significant

698
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,799
sufficiently advanced is

699
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,928
indistinguishable from magic but in the

700
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,580
the 21st century that's kind of become

701
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:34,499
anything that i haven't spent enough

702
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,240
time on YouTube watching is

703
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:38,340
indistinguishable from magic

704
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,889
and that's true for security and I

705
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,689
wished it people would realize that

706
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:44,129
security isn't magic it's not something

707
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,340
that's unattainable it's something they

708
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,050
can learn about

709
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,260
like anything else like you don't have

710
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,760
to know everything about modern cars to

711
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,650
be able to do some car maintenance and

712
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,260
you don't have to know everything about

713
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:58,510
cooking to cook a decent meal we should

714
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,590
all have some skill sets across the

715
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,950
board it's just part of being a

716
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,720
well-rounded human and people can learn

717
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,040
about security and we should enable them

718
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,630
and facilitate them to do that and it

719
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,670
shouldn't necessarily be like a forced

720
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:12,070
oh death by PowerPoint security

721
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:13,060
awareness thing just enable people to

722
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,590
learn about it because it's interesting

723
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,600
and can encourage them to come to

724
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,159
conferences like this and encourage them

725
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,840
to watch talks and learn about things

726
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,120
that interest them in security whether

727
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,570
that's lock-picking or you know internet

728
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,429
security um I think that everybody can

729
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,960
learn something about security even if

730
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,610
they can't know everything about it none

731
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,160
of us know raise your hand if you know

732
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:35,709
everything about cybersecurity I'm not

733
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,410
raising my hand okay Amanda knows Amanda

734
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,020
isn't one person in this room who knows

735
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:43,830
everything about ok there's one more I

736
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:48,010
don't care you're not Amanda

737
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:49,120
whatever whatever anyway the only person

738
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:52,870
in this room who knows everything about

739
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,780
cybersecurity is Amanda and none of the

740
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:57,429
rest of you do I don't and it's it

741
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,050
that's ok where we spent like our whole

742
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,060
careers in our whole life studying IT

743
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,560
and cybersecurity and we don't know

744
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,600
everything about it so it's okay to not

745
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:15,210
know everything about it just go out and

746
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:18,370
learn things I bow to you so I was at a

747
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:20,880
meeting no conference and there was a

748
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:24,069
gentleman there that was talking about

749
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:26,680
his company that I believe was based in

750
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,920
Atlanta and it was one of the few

751
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:33,250
companies that was doing prostate cancer

752
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:36,940
testing so guys really you know they

753
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:40,989
wanted this company to go forward and at

754
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:44,220
some point despite it being against

755
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:47,669
company policy his head administrator

756
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:51,489
had downloaded music file-sharing

757
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:55,570
software onto her peer-to-peer excuse me

758
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:58,620
peer-to-peer and a company that was

759
00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:04,080
quote-unquote working with the FCC

760
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:04,609
he was doing scans FTC okay I can't talk

761
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,040
either

762
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:10,590
[Music]

763
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,290
found a way in and here was the company

764
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:17,730
and here it was and they said well give

765
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:21,770
us $40,000 and we'll clean up this mess

766
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:24,330
and the guy was pretty savvy he went in

767
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:27,570
stripped out her machine took care of

768
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:29,190
everything and there was it wound up

769
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,180
being a really long story do you

770
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,300
remember his name

771
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:36,509
we got the book somewhere at home

772
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:39,480
the FTC was behaving kind of like the

773
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:41,580
IRS here's our rules but we don't

774
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,370
necessarily share them and now you're

775
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:48,360
gonna get hit with big fines via this

776
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:52,100
other company but there was a company

777
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:56,550
policy already in place do not do this

778
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:59,490
lady had signed most of you your

779
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:01,830
companies have a computer usage policy

780
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:04,399
that you have to sign off I won't do

781
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:06,990
this I won't do that kind of thing yeah

782
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,180
did it anyway she thought you know I'm

783
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,399
the head admin I can do it pretty much

784
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:15,299
whatever I want and it goes back to you

785
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:18,510
talking you've got to go hey I have seen

786
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:21,930
this talk to your people go all right

787
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:25,640
here we go more remedial education to

788
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,640
try and fix this problem

789
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:32,400
okay I'm gonna cheat and do two because

790
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:36,750
I have the Talking Stick okay okay um

791
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,850
okay so the first one is not listening

792
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:42,300
to the voice inside their head that says

793
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:43,920
something is wrong if if you see

794
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,850
something that's a lizard if anybody

795
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,040
sees something that's a little bit off

796
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:49,290
we have very finely tuned lizard brains

797
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,690
that give us signals that say you know

798
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:54,570
hey something might be wrong and you

799
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,940
should be scared and run away or Aysen

800
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:59,220
you're going to get eaten so if if you

801
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,350
don't listen to that voice if you ignore

802
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:05,009
it if you have the false sense of

803
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:07,319
security if you are just going about

804
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:11,220
your day and and just letting your

805
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,460
amygdala just flatline then you're not

806
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,379
going to notice

807
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,640
things and or you might notice things

808
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,710
but you're not going to pay attention to

809
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,150
them you're going to be trying to do

810
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:23,410
things as quickly and as efficiently and

811
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,330
getting the things done you're you're

812
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,649
running around like crazy or you're

813
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,110
trying to do everything that needs to

814
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,970
happen and and you're not paying

815
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:34,420
attention to those little voices that

816
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:37,689
say like hey maybe I shouldn't transfer

817
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,970
$100,000 via wire to this person who SMS

818
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:42,130
me like I don't know how this stuff

819
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,799
happens I mean people have to think like

820
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,330
this is a little off but I really want

821
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,850
to keep my job so I'm gonna do this

822
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:52,600
because if I don't I might get fired so

823
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:53,970
listen to that voice and then um crap I

824
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,740
forgot the fifth one

825
00:37:53,970 --> 00:38:06,910
all right maybe I'm not gonna cheat but

826
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:09,100
yeah do two more so if you actually

827
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:12,790
think I know everything about InfoSec I

828
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:37,980
also have a really good talk on quasi

829
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:40,930
prime numbers and my life my last one is

830
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:44,710
my users thinking that one log type is

831
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:46,569
is perfect to do to be able to you know

832
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,220
handle all of their security alerts as

833
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:51,000
well if you can't tell this as a

834
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:54,220
recurring theme I do a lot of blog stuff

835
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,090
you know we'll have you know customers

836
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:59,290
send us their ids/ips alerts you can't

837
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,360
really correlate what's actually

838
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:05,980
happening in an attack if you just get

839
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:08,290
one you know you know one one piece of

840
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,930
software or one log type there's no

841
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:14,620
correlation that happens across you know

842
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:16,330
is that user logging in in three

843
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:20,290
different places are they just you know

844
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:22,060
coming in from one area it really gives

845
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:25,750
us a whole lot of blind spots and it's

846
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:27,940
really hard to convince them that

847
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:30,490
you know sending us all the logs is what

848
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,319
we really want with some softwares you

849
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:35,618
can't I mean you can do that but it's

850
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:39,130
going to end up breaking your budget but

851
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:42,630
prioritizing log types as is something

852
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:46,720
that I think they get wrong a lot I

853
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:49,920
remembered what it was okay okay so

854
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:55,089
privacy should be a basic human right

855
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,980
yes thank you so but a lot of users are

856
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:59,078
willing to give up their privacy and the

857
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,960
privacy of their friends over figuring

858
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:03,130
out what kind of potato they are or

859
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,910
what's cut which Star Trek character

860
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:08,440
they are so and they will not only give

861
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,240
up their own privacy for the stable give

862
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,010
up your privacy and the everyone in

863
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,109
their contact book by uploading the

864
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,789
contact books two things the social

865
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:18,460
media sites and things like that that

866
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:19,750
they'll they'll post as much as you try

867
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,390
to hide your face from the internet

868
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:25,599
other people will post photos of you and

869
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:27,190
I think that the users are just they

870
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,690
just don't understand what privacy is

871
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,180
and a lot of the younger generations

872
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:34,299
have grown up not without any privacy so

873
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,710
they don't care and you know some of us

874
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:39,190
that grew up without the internet and I

875
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:41,349
know I'm dating myself here but we know

876
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,720
what you know at least some privacy is

877
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:46,329
so so I think that you know users just

878
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:49,058
need to understand what they're doing

879
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:51,890
and how it impacts others I mean just in

880
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:54,089
general but it in terms of privacy -

881
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,660
[Music]

882
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:58,869
that's awesome

883
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:01,000
and we yeah I don't know how many social

884
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:02,890
media posts I've said that I I used to

885
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,609
follow click on those damn surveys and I

886
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:07,328
realized that was really really stupid

887
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:09,788
unfortunately there's not enough people

888
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:14,849
who have realized what stupid is I just

889
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:18,730
put my photo online they'll get it the

890
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:20,470
so we got a few minutes left we could do

891
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,940
some more or we could throw it open for

892
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,470
customers why don't we throw it up into

893
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:27,539
you guys for the question these gals are

894
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,538
really awesome so I see a hand over here

895
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:36,450
just talking I'll repeat the question

896
00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:36,450
okay that'll work

897
00:41:47,490 --> 00:42:05,169
in any way even though that our company

898
00:41:51,780 --> 00:42:06,790
but feel like worthless herb in there so

899
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,470
the question basically is we have our

900
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:10,870
vendors providing products but they are

901
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:12,609
doing things that are not in our best

902
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:14,290
interest but we feel like we're the

903
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,120
small fish and the big fee and we just

904
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:25,029
have to take what they give to us who

905
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:28,150
would like to respond okay if you're an

906
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:30,970
introvert find an extrovert pair up

907
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:33,610
become allies extroverts need introverts

908
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:36,160
and because introverts get the work done

909
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:39,220
extroverts like make everybody else do

910
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,520
work right so find somebody who will

911
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:45,730
speak up for you because pair up find

912
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:56,259
allies that will help you yeah find a

913
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:59,830
voice exactly thank you yeah everybody

914
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:03,190
give me my question is how do you go

915
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:05,799
about and explaining to people that your

916
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,030
threat model isn't my threat model it's

917
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,610
like I think a lot of the things in

918
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:11,530
information security is like oh well I

919
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,180
never have to worry about this it's like

920
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:16,270
I've got this I'm hide behind seven

921
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:17,859
proxies it's like so I'm fine it's like

922
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,410
how do you try to convince people it's

923
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,720
like look just because you live this way

924
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:24,970
you've got this these rest early that

925
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,549
doesn't mean everybody else has these

926
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,839
issues or doesn't have these risk and I

927
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,940
think y'all are the perfect people that

928
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,230
actually explain that you know your

929
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,570
threat models might be a little bit

930
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:37,320
different than mine so it's like talk

931
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,320
about that a little bit

932
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:45,399
I would love to answer that one so does

933
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,009
anybody here play Dungeons & Dragons or

934
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,150
its ilk okay if you play Dungeons &

935
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,740
Dragons you're really good at solving

936
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:52,599
this problem I just gave a talk at

937
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,250
another National Laboratory about this

938
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:56,410
topic trying to get people to understand

939
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,359
how to threat model and what I did is

940
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:01,690
you know human human brains run on their

941
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:02,950
euro divyam we run on narratives and so

942
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:05,830
making people think about a specific

943
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:07,359
problem and comparing it to how their

944
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:09,520
neighbors perceive that problem

945
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,259
especially with familiar devices like in

946
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,720
that lecture I did fitbit's

947
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:16,060
let's threat model out fitbit's and how

948
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,140
your threat model will vary against your

949
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,340
neighbors and then I let them pick their

950
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,720
own devices and they could pick any

951
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,700
smart device they wanted that's in their

952
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,549
home they could pick their Alexa or

953
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,740
their Smart TV and I had them just I did

954
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:28,599
step by step to help them threat model

955
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:31,390
it's just like playing an RPG you know

956
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:34,780
what happens if this happens what if you

957
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:36,069
get divorced or you win the lottery what

958
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,050
how does that impact your threat model

959
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:40,000
then thinking about this one device and

960
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:42,340
just doing that bad exercise and playing

961
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,109
that game in a safe environment is a

962
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,400
really great way to get people

963
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:48,220
interested in threat modeling and

964
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,570
understanding how my threat model for

965
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:51,098
smart locks on my apartment or are

966
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:53,530
completely different than my neighbors

967
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:55,089
threat model who doesn't care that about

968
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:58,540
anything is subject for getting his TV

969
00:44:55,089 --> 00:45:02,220
stolen so yeah that's the make it a game

970
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,220
make it a story and make it a game

971
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:15,640
okay thanks for doing this this is a

972
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:19,869
very borrows panel so I think it's many

973
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,950
questions about Lindy so a lot of the

974
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:23,470
things which you guys are talking about

975
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:26,020
are essentially about tying it back to

976
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:27,759
the you know being human like we have

977
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:30,430
curiosity we try to be helpful in

978
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,380
general we want to feel connected we

979
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:36,430
want to show that we are better off than

980
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:39,310
someone else also we do not like to be

981
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:41,680
in uncomfortable situations and we

982
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:43,150
always do not listen to the inner voice

983
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,940
and say okay let's just do this quickly

984
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:49,480
because efficiency or I need to watch

985
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:51,520
this show on TV so and also at times

986
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,660
bosses are gonna boss and you know

987
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,980
somebody would want to

988
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,500
I'm your boss I want to be a domain

989
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:58,030
admin because I'm your supervisor or in

990
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,190
right now I want you have the all the I

991
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:02,770
in Rose or I want to have the global

992
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,440
admin on Azure or equivalent so how do

993
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:07,660
you solve and more important how to

994
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,210
communicate and talk about this thing so

995
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:12,569
this is a little bit fundamental in my

996
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,570
opinion

997
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:19,299
I mean I mean so it's more like how do

998
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,580
you I mean you know solve this human

999
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,500
condition kind of question right you

1000
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,240
know people would want to overshare

1001
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,460
people would want to feel connected

1002
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,859
people would want to help bosses would

1003
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:45,730
try to you know do the boss things and

1004
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:50,350
all of this I have found that people who

1005
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:51,930
over share it eventually comes back one

1006
00:46:50,350 --> 00:47:03,279
way or another to bite them in the ass

1007
00:46:51,930 --> 00:47:06,279
and no agreeing with you and there are

1008
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,900
times and it's really hard and it and

1009
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,680
and maybe it's a little bit of this

1010
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:13,240
introvert extrovert thing there are

1011
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,089
times that you have to go up to your

1012
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,310
boss and go you're really doing a shitty

1013
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:23,350
job on this and I'm gonna take it over

1014
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:25,210
you know and and I did that once yeah

1015
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:32,830
there's probably nicer words it's the

1016
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:36,280
end of the day and I'm tired it's it's

1017
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:38,680
the human condition you overshare you

1018
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,900
you you go somewhere you shouldn't go

1019
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:45,160
with your computer it's gonna be costing

1020
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:48,040
you money my kids swam for a long time

1021
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,839
and their coach once said sometimes you

1022
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:53,590
have to just throw them in the pool and

1023
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:56,410
watch what happens and and save them if

1024
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:59,830
you have to but they will learn and I'm

1025
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:02,850
really big on thinking that we humans

1026
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:08,080
can learn and that we can ultimately

1027
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:10,240
find the right path and sometimes people

1028
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:15,180
just have to be kind of nudged a little

1029
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,180
bit on that type one

1030
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:22,570
thank you this is an excellent panel one

1031
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:24,710
question I have is in your experience

1032
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:27,830
one thing you have to keep in mind is

1033
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:29,390
that the the functions are the users

1034
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:31,160
might not have the same threat models

1035
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,920
they have they have different incentives

1036
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:37,160
right but my question to you is to what

1037
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:40,880
extent have you been able to have your

1038
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:43,100
users support your messages of better

1039
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,110
security within your organization's in

1040
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,839
other words is you don't have the budget

1041
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:50,869
because of X how often have you been

1042
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:58,520
able to get the users to go tell your

1043
00:48:50,869 --> 00:49:03,860
boss hey listen we need X I'm really

1044
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:07,220
glad I know the answer to this one so I

1045
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:09,920
did like a internal purple teaming

1046
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:14,660
fishing thing right with almost almost

1047
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:19,190
no budget so we were able to get a lot

1048
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:21,259
of user driven ideas around security

1049
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:23,740
when it came to just kind of giving them

1050
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:26,780
Amazon gift cards every now and then for

1051
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:29,450
submitting you know spam report I mean

1052
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,760
spam email or phishing email or weird

1053
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:34,580
things like they would get put into a

1054
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,190
drawing and you know they there was more

1055
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:39,950
of an incentive there for the users to

1056
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:41,990
be able to like now I care about

1057
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,399
security because it's there's something

1058
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:45,979
a gamification there's something in it

1059
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,070
for me now and making it a little bit

1060
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:56,960
more accessible and easier for them to

1061
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:59,510
participate in it the private companies

1062
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:06,850
frequently have a bigger budget for that

1063
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:11,690
kind of bribery yes yeah government

1064
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:13,549
those companies it ain't happenin it you

1065
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:17,090
know so then they have to try and find

1066
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:23,990
other ways but they've been really slow

1067
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:26,600
I know that yeah I think that um rather

1068
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:28,279
than punishing people for making

1069
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,450
mistakes you want to hold people up as

1070
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,029
models of good behavior

1071
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:34,950
you want to provide recognition as much

1072
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:36,960
as monetary what whether it's monetary

1073
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:38,788
or in the newsletter or at the you know

1074
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,289
the next quarterly meeting or whatever

1075
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:48,510
so positive reinforcement works much

1076
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:50,160
better than negative okay we're about

1077
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,559
out of time I wanted to do two things

1078
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:56,339
really quick first I wanted to thank

1079
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:59,930
this awesome group of women who did me

1080
00:50:56,339 --> 00:51:04,410
the courtesy of saying yes when asked

1081
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:06,118
and I want to challenge all of you to

1082
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:08,098
take the information you've learned here

1083
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,109
not just from this session and don't

1084
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:15,980
just take it back to your cybersecurity

1085
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:15,980
peers take it to your users give the
