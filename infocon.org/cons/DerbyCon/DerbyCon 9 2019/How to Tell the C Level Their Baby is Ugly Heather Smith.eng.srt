00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:33,180

4
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,559
is ugly because it probably is so I

5
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,690
don't know if any of you read the

6
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,280
pamphlet or you came here blind or what

7
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,649
you're expecting to see but hopefully

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,730
you get some of it if if not I hope you

9
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,969
brought something to drink so I'll go

10
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,430
ahead and get into this Who am I

11
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:02,340
there's supposed to be a picture there

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:08,939
is there a picture there oh this might

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:11,390
go poorly um let me try something real

14
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:20,520

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,020
doxed myself in the program my name is

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,570
Heather Smith I go by litmus most of the

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,189
time just mousse if I introduce you and

19
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,048
I don't introduce myself as Heather it's

20
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,699
not because I'm like weird about my name

21
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,130
it's just because I've gone by mousse

22
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,000
for like years I'm a dfi our dumpster

23
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,429
diver I see all the things I was

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,549
formerly a project manager and indeed an

25
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,619
analyst so I've had a lot of experience

26
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,799
trying to convince management to do

27
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,320
things that they didn't want to do look

28
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,320
at logs all day most of my time is

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,639
report writing that's a lot of fun not

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,250
going to be talking too much about that

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,880
I scream into the void I'm a pretty

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,890
benevolent contractor I'm white hat and

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,810
I've seen some shit because I'm a

34
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,860
contractor I might have seen your shit

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:17,100
alright so fact most babies are ugly

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:20,700
I like this all right so your baby might

37
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:23,370
be ugly ish mfa isn't enabled and you

38
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,730
Yolo your password management so many

39
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,470
times I have seen this in fact a buddy

40
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,929
in the Dallas group said the other day

41
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:35,400
that he saw Trello as a password manager

42
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:38,010
the other day so that's fun your baby

43
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,120
might be ugly if your Mac environment is

44
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,620
doubling as your users iTunes library

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,780
guys if we're not monitoring this

46
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,400
insider threat is just like oh yeah

47
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,680
we're gonna have all the sensitive

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,150
documents created on this users Mac and

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,940
they're just gonna sync it to home and

50
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,209
if they go away so does all of those you

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,900
know files with them your baby might be

52
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,270
ugly

53
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,360
if personal email is accessible and not

54
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,700
monitored I see two things as a caveat

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,290
because I know this is a pain point for

56
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,239
a lot of us get fish all the time

57
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,560
personal email is enabled in the

58
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,630
environment they have to use it because

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,269
some executive needs it that's all well

60
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:19,350
and fine if you're not monitoring it

61
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:22,890
though like shame on you so your baby

62
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,230
might be ugly if you only are monitoring

63
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:28,500
events on the endpoints this is the hill

64
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,450
that I died on I am super big into the

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,040
defense in depth I hear every company

66
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:36,420
say you know we have the Silver Bullet

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,870
no you don't know so yeah don't don't do

68
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:44,309
that your baby might be ugly if you roll

69
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:48,090
your own cryptography there it is uh I

70
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,519
have only met one person in my life who

71
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,530
I think could probably roll his own

72
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,120
cryptography and be okay and he's

73
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,130
sitting in the front row and he goes by

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,019
Ridgeback and he's right there and when

75
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,769
I told him this he laughed at me and

76
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,769
said fuck no

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:11,920
so don't do it your baby might be ugly

78
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:17,500
if you find five Enys on a firewall let

79
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:20,529
me tell you a story this one hurts so I

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,300
found five NES on a firewall I found my

81
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,440
money's on a firewall to mission

82
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,840
critical systems and when I asked why

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,030
than any source in any destination was

84
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,799
not enough to make it work they were

85
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,719
like well we thought that it might

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,760
exclude some users and we didn't want

87
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,590
any downtime so we did any user and I

88
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,050
said yeah there's there's there's two

89
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,479
more Eddie's there it was like well yeah

90
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,669
we have a lot of services so you know

91
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,699
any of them will do okay so you put an

92
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:51,099
unnie there and then and I was like okay

93
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,539
so so any service and I was like and and

94
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,520
and then that leaves one more and they

95
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:58,210
were like yeah any application so we

96
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,159
didn't know the difference between

97
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,930
service and application ladies and

98
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,750
gentlemen five innings on a firewall

99
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,080
this is just a pate all right

100
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:11,830
so how do we communicate these things to

101
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:18,250
a sea level to make sure that I get

102
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:21,359
changed effectively um guys if this was

103
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:25,150
my boss I would never quit

104
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,460
so sea level is typically human they're

105
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,659
just like we are

106
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,760
except they go to many many more

107
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,020
meetings hopefully I hope you don't go

108
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,530
to that many meetings they're

109
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:39,219
constrained by time so a lot of what I

110
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:41,138
found in working with them is if you're

111
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,820
not able to start out with the meeting

112
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,729
potatoes of something and sorry

113
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,940
vegetarians I'm still living in Dallas

114
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:50,860
so I use their analogies if you're not

115
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,960
able to get to that that chunk of

116
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,389
exactly what you want in a very succinct

117
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,330
way they're going to be frustrated you

118
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:00,070
know they just don't have time for you

119
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,289
or from me or anybody else they don't

120
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,389
even have time for themselves they're

121
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:08,050
very sick of meetings so bullet points

122
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:10,000
on paragraphs they're very focused on

123
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,360
the CIA triad because they've had to

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,780
drink that kool-aid

125
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,729
how do I effectively tell the people

126
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,710
that work laterally to me because you're

127
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:20,240
not just working with a/c so you're also

128
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,549
having to work with the sea so who then

129
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,430
has to work with his whole suite or or

130
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,349
her whole suite or anybody above them to

131
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,750
where if it's publicly traded what are

132
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:31,069
you communicating you know there are

133
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,650
non-technical people everywhere that

134
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:35,810
have to be communicated to so how do

135
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,780
they how do they communicate that and

136
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,340
it's in dollar amounts and it's in you

137
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,948
know what's happening to our environment

138
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,258
so keeping in mind where they stand and

139
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,240
what they care about that's kind of

140
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:49,150
where I found the sweet spot is if you

141
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,960
can tie it back into that

142
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,780
confidentiality integrity and

143
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,020
availability you can probably get stuff

144
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,849
done and just make it a Horror Story and

145
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,530
then because they work with so many

146
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:01,009
non-technical people on the other side

147
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,460
of the fence

148
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:08,289
maybe not you if you are able to

149
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:10,580
translate whatever you found two ways

150
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:12,740
succinctly both technical and

151
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,479
non-technical they'll probably take it

152
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,469
and use it because now they only have to

153
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:23,949
copy and paste so where are my red

154
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:27,699
teamers at oh my god really that's it or

155
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:31,729
are you shy so I've got the front row

156
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:33,289
so red team I'll just talk to you and a

157
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:36,919
few scattered sorry I

158
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:38,229
so I've I've seen red teamers have the

159
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:41,659
most difficult time with this

160
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:44,389
communicating to the c-level why they

161
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:47,029
should be breaking their shit it's a

162
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:50,599
very difficult like kind of line to

163
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:52,819
tutto and so having a top-ten list and

164
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,699
coming in with questions in mind of what

165
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,800
they care about most and scoping around

166
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:00,110
that even if you know and you find

167
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,300
something that is completely left field

168
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,620
because it's an unknown unknown they

169
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,210
don't know about it you didn't know it

170
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,949
existed if you have ten things generally

171
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,529
speaking use your social engineering

172
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:15,680
skills tie it back into that top ten and

173
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:17,029
have them like affirm in writing that

174
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,849
those are the things that are most

175
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:23,870
important to them and so have that that

176
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,650
communication off off the bat always

177
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,830
have a scope

178
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,690
make sure that they've agreed to it if

179
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,270
you don't they'll come back and say I

180
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,309
didn't say that even if they didn't say

181
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,329
it they'll say I didn't say that

182
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:39,588
it happens they forget writing his best

183
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,169
including screenshots even if they're

184
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:45,890
overtly technical this is something that

185
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:49,579
I learned the hard way in working with

186
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:53,810
some sea levels because it was frowned

187
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,730
upon to be too technical too fast and

188
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,729
really what that meant was language and

189
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,260
they seemed to love the codes so if you

190
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,880
have a picture even if they'll never

191
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,700
understand it and I'm not saying that

192
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,860
sea levels come from you know areas that

193
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,210
are non-technical it's not that but

194
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,279
nobody can be an expert in all the

195
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,900
things so just assume that maybe they

196
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,460
don't know exactly what you've done in

197
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,920
your screenshot but include it anyways

198
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,750
because it shows your value you're doing

199
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,360
something that they couldn't do or that

200
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,740
nobody else and the team is doing and

201
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,290
it's kind of the proof in the pudding of

202
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,089
here is a picture that you don't have to

203
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,390
analyze here's the non technical

204
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:31,490
language under it and so those captions

205
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:35,360
and that non-technical language should

206
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:38,630
answer who what how and why and it's in

207
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,860
business speak so as basic as you can

208
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:45,439
make it of you know somebody came over

209
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,320
and they popped our domain controller

210
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,830
and now all of the users are basically

211
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,800
not necessarily our users you know as as

212
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:58,850
simple as possible of to get your point

213
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,930
across teamwork makes the dream work

214
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:04,760
where are my blue teamers

215
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,170
ah okay this makes this yeah I do DF IR

216
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,069
I probably should have said this talk

217
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:12,529
was for everybody but um love you guys

218
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,770
so red team should love blue team blue

219
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,620
team

220
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:18,110
I definitely love my red team working

221
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,270
together to arrive holistic solutions is

222
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,790
where I've seen most c-level sign off

223
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:26,180
quicker because you're mitigating any

224
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:29,060
gap in a whole solution of you know

225
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,219
we've proven that the attack was either

226
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,660
successful or unsuccessful and we've

227
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,730
proven where the blue team

228
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,949
or can't see something and so doing

229
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,329
those peer attack and defense workshops

230
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:40,370
and and going through your own

231
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:43,399
environment and trying to see end to end

232
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,620
and even pulling in your networking team

233
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,959
they don't even have to be security and

234
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,699
getting people involved more people you

235
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,649
have involved and the more resources you

236
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:54,620
have involved probably the stronger your

237
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:58,100
arguments gonna be when you do this

238
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:02,800
learn from my fale have everybody and I

239
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:06,500
mean everybody timestamp and UTC

240
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,329
everything that they do and don't leave

241
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,939
it up to assumption that oh that's just

242
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:13,040
what everybody does don't do that

243
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:14,240
timestamp everything in UTC and make

244
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,800
sure that they match up at the end

245
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,779
because then you can do an easy timeline

246
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,519
and you're off doing more work and

247
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:22,269
that's really that that teamwork is how

248
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,980
you're finding the unknown unknowns so

249
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:26,689
how do you translate this to your C

250
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,180
levels this can be kind of difficult

251
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:30,889
because this is again much more

252
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,079
technical like workshop than you're

253
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:36,620
doing with with your experts in the

254
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:38,870
field so literally I boil it down to if

255
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,660
attack is successful here's what you

256
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:44,660
need to know what is the average time to

257
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,810
mitigate it why do we care about this it

258
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,509
goes back to that CIA triad of is there

259
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:53,420
downtime are things available what's

260
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:55,639
going on you know it is it impacting

261
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,250
anything it's doing that kind of impact

262
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,829
analysis and then where are my resources

263
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,319
if my resources are pulled in on this

264
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:06,258
how much money am i spending on each

265
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:08,389
head and are there enough of them to get

266
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:10,730
it done you know and giving them more of

267
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:13,069
that of listen if this attack is

268
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:16,100
actually successful we're not we're not

269
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:17,360
prepared for it because X Y Z or we are

270
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,680
prepared for it but you're about to

271
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,779
spend a lot of money and so if attack

272
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,489
isn't successful what is in place

273
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,829
stopping it what have you already spent

274
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,470
money on what is it what is our sock

275
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:33,229
look like what are we doing right and

276
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:36,079
making sure that you're also reporting

277
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,300
those in a good way because generally

278
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,569
speaking you can probably say if attack

279
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:44,000
was successful this is your cost if we

280
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:47,029
stop it here's this little number that

281
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,470
is basically negligible in comparison

282
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,290
and I know you all have heard the

283
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:54,110
average cost of breeches like something

284
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,180
in the 7.4 million now I don't know I

285
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,930
didn't see the latest statistic I didn't

286
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,449
look it up I'm a bad presenter so

287
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,920
teamwork makes the dream work part two

288
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:06,620
you can do all of this and you can say

289
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,660
all of this until the cows come home I

290
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,220
can't tell you how many emails I've

291
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,009
written where I have it bold at the very

292
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,509
top I might highlight it in yellow

293
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:16,069
exactly what I want done if it doesn't

294
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:18,290
have a picture it doesn't fly with some

295
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:20,149
people not saying all of them but

296
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:25,759
pictures really make things stick out

297
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:28,699
and so I do this with means I am not

298
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,709
recommending doing this at home no your

299
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:33,800
sea level if they have a sense of humor

300
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:35,508
this might work if they don't I actually

301
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,729
what I do recommend is doing graphs and

302
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,620
screenshots at tables and taking

303
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,110
anything you're saying

304
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,550
that's a little bit lengthier and an

305
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,470
executive summary and when I say

306
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,870
lengthier it could even be as short as

307
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,509
two sentences still having a graph or a

308
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,579
chart to visualize that will drive the

309
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:53,689
point home so it's like when you're in

310
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:56,660
grade school when you're writing an

311
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:58,279
essay and they say start out with three

312
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,559
things that you're gonna talk about in

313
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,329
the body conclude with three things that

314
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,649
you talked about in the body you're kind

315
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,870
of doing that and supplementing with

316
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,730
pictures and tables and I've seen a lot

317
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,279
less pushback when you do that work

318
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,829
upfront and it takes less time than the

319
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,750
back-and-forth of arguing usually to say

320
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:17,449
you know why do I care about this which

321
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,120
is what a day a former c-level used to

322
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:24,139
say all the time and tell me why I care

323
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,720
hmm executive summaries you really want

324
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:28,490
to boil it down to if you're if you're

325
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,170
doing something that's proactive have

326
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,500
your hypothesis in there even if you're

327
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,750
doing an IR having high PI hypotheses

328
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,660
early on and having those kind of

329
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,209
documented even for yourself and having

330
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,459
that in Business Week will help with the

331
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:45,679
communication chain and sometimes help

332
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:47,959
drip drive change as you're going

333
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,339
so if you're an incident responder you

334
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,369
don't really want to wait until the

335
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:56,899
report to say hey you know we saw that

336
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,980
you had RDP exposed to the Internet you

337
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,500
know four weeks ago

338
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,360
use the report like as soon as you

339
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,480
notice say hey maybe we should maybe

340
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,889
shut this down and here's why and so

341
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,050
making sure that you have your

342
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:11,310
hypothesis even if it's not like you

343
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,260
haven't proven that's how somebody got

344
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,750
in if you notice it see something say

345
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,480
something your findings should have

346
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,250
executive summaries and then cost

347
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,110
analysis or impact analysis risk

348
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,540
analysis all of these things to make

349
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,329
better or change and I don't ever say

350
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,730
fix I really don't think that security

351
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:36,329
is ever fixed but we do make it better

352
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:39,180
so blue team so many of you should

353
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:40,739
recognize the chain at the top it might

354
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,920
have triggered many of you on a ticket

355
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,040
and the the trigger words come in at

356
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,599
very end there if false positive we

357
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,639
should tune it if true positive we

358
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,519
should prevent it right you would think

359
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,790
that that's just you know what what we

360
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,579
do know so review and closed ends up

361
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,110
happening a lot when those two steps

362
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,620
aren't taken either something is not

363
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,940
tuned so your tools aren't tuned or

364
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,339
preventive measures haven't been taken

365
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,079
you have a someone on the management

366
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,660
team who doesn't want to block for some

367
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,609
reason somebody on your management team

368
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,980
is worried about blocking legitimate

369
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:20,639
traffic a legitimate client legitimate

370
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,199
service or you know some firewalls don't

371
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,660
actually show you their rules

372
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,209
a couple do some don't share you know

373
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:31,199
the the behind the scenes behind the the

374
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:33,719
green screen and so tuning that can be a

375
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,370
little bit of a pain driving change

376
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,430
through doing packet capture it takes

377
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:44,459
time and analysis and further analysis

378
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:46,979
to tune so the the beating my head

379
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:51,180
against the wall that happened here was

380
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:53,389
months and months where I was working IR

381
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,589
and my sock was seeing the same tickets

382
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:59,149
and I can't tell you how many times I

383
00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:02,850
heard if I see one more of these

384
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:05,339
insert funny malware here I'm going to

385
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,799
jump off the building and I was I was

386
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:09,958
fearful for my sock because I really

387
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,879
think that they were about to they would

388
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,270
see the same attack every day spend a

389
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,560
lot of

390
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,750
I'm on it they weren't spending time

391
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,270
doing other analysis they had no time to

392
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,339
do threat hunting and it was clogging up

393
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,599
the whole chain of events so metrics for

394
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,849
your sea level

395
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:28,139
how much average time is being taken to

396
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,879
remediate these things where we're not

397
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,410
tuning them and we're not preventing

398
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,060
them so if they don't want to block

399
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,710
things if they don't want to tune the

400
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,850
firewall if they don't want to if they

401
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,230
don't want to look at the laughs and

402
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,550
they don't want to they don't want to

403
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,110
bother other teams that aren't under

404
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:45,629
them you know what what's the cost of it

405
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,909
you know and and not just to your team

406
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,530
so the the cost to the associates you're

407
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,570
paying for but what's the cost of

408
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,310
missing everything else that they're not

409
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:57,720
looking at at that time okay what's

410
00:17:53,310 --> 00:18:01,110
what's the cost of you know maintaining

411
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:05,660
a solution that maybe isn't it's got

412
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,659
defaults on what are we looking at so

413
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:29,810
it's like boiling hot did you sit on

414
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:29,810
this you would when are you talking next

415
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,539
[Music]

416
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,539
[Applause]

417
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:55,730
that's so terrible hold on I'm Scott I

418
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,870
hate you so much

419
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,639
you know what this is like a fine

420
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,639
whiskey we're gonna sip the rest of this

421
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:27,340
do that to your c-level and tell them

422
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,389
that if they don't change the thing that

423
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,240
there's more where that came from

424
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:36,100
because nobody will ever like say no to

425
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:38,350
you again um no so um the the risk of

426
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:48,040
impact and change is reiterated to hold

427
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:50,100
on this is great so so if change did not

428
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,149
change you're still gonna do over unders

429
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,480
you're making it something that they can

430
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:57,310
understand and really taking your sock

431
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,860
away from threat hunting from for

432
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:03,970
something that can be fixed is very very

433
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:05,949
costly and that's how you get external

434
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,680
consultants like me and your environment

435
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:11,890
doing IRS and you should never ever want

436
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,660
to see me again all right and then

437
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,830
alternative solutions and cost that's

438
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,630
actually really important and I put that

439
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:20,080
there for a reason I got distracted okay

440
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:23,590
so who works in an environment where you

441
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,740
have machines say Windows XP where you

442
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:29,139
cannot catch them or whatever reason yay

443
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,540
I know you people I've felt your pain

444
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,980
you can't patch them you can't because

445
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,270
of some proprietary software and

446
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,280
everybody students about it all day long

447
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,379
I'm just patch it no you can't do that

448
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,790
you can hit like a port on them and turn

449
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,960
it off for seven days and nobody knows

450
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,629
how because it's in a foreign language

451
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,550
like you don't know like how it works

452
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,560
you probably can't touch the machine so

453
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,720
getting a creative alternative solution

454
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,909
doing NetFlow doing something to where

455
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,100
you're putting out sinkholes for

456
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,590
something get some PI's in your

457
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,139
environment and do testing like what's

458
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:02,340
the cost of alternative solutions and

459
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,340
kind of present that as well

460
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:15,490
all right um so reporting this is one of

461
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:19,840
my favorite things to do I'm I'm a

462
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:22,720
masochist uh so I to gain c-level

463
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,520
approval for solutions um I think it's

464
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,560
really important to provide even if

465
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,170
you're just blue or you're just red to

466
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,580
provide both considerations we should be

467
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,230
feeding each other it shouldn't just be

468
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,659
one side or the other I think gone are

469
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,370
the days where we're either red or blue

470
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,980
we really need a hybrid otherwise we're

471
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:42,370
missing stuff in-between so doing risk

472
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,560
assessments looking at the staffing and

473
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,800
budget to implement solutions

474
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,690
what is the staffing and budget if a

475
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,120
solution is not implemented I would okay

476
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,000
so what that means is kind of what I

477
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,189
just said about you know if the worst

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,170
case scenario happens and you talk to

479
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,280
your disaster recovery folks do you have

480
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:05,320
the staff to respond very quickly to a

481
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,470
bad incident and what is your downtime

482
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,899
going to cost you and then how much does

483
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:14,320
the average external dfi our team or

484
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,360
team member cost so looking at that and

485
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,270
using that to kind of like drive your

486
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:23,979
your your solution and the reason behind

487
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:27,010
it and then taking that and putting it

488
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,320
in a way that's kind of more businessí

489
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:33,070
and boring for them they love it um I

490
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,830
also kind of love it so I like

491
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:38,800
flowcharts I used to be a project

492
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,240
manager I'm very big an agile scrum not

493
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,620
as big on Gantt charts because things

494
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,500
can go wrong this is something called

495
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,389
waterfall I made fun of it I stole this

496
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,990
mean this is the one that I didn't make

497
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:51,430
very much stolen liked it a lot

498
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,530
panelize plan executed three baseline

499
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,240
execute three baseline execute cold slap

500
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,340
of reality switch to agile method

501
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,850
finished project very very late pretend

502
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:04,659
you can avoid this next time you can uh

503
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:07,090
so um a lot of the the visuals that come

504
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,720
with this is providing them a workflow

505
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:12,110
and a chart or or a timeline something

506
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,240
that shows

507
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:18,469
this is I've already thought about this

508
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,510
we've done the assessment this is where

509
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,120
you can just present this here take this

510
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,649
this is this is exactly what your

511
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,389
solution is and you're basically handing

512
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:29,600
it off and in such a way that they now

513
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:32,510
have leverage to argue for your time and

514
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,399
the thing that you want to do and it's

515
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:37,010
when you present something like this

516
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:39,350
it's not just arguing to them because

517
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:41,390
it's there's so many other

518
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,908
considerations it's not like sea-levels

519
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,710
want to say no to you so giving them the

520
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:47,990
ammunition to where it's easy for them

521
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,909
to get agreement and buy-in from either

522
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:54,230
laterally from the rest of the c-suite

523
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:57,110
from the board from whoever else is

524
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,760
above them is super important and the

525
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:02,090
more ammunition you give them in

526
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,639
different forms the better off you are

527
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:07,189
and this is this is where actually red

528
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:09,049
and blue has to unfortunately become

529
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,730
special specialists in project

530
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:13,158
management as well because that's really

531
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,559
what we're suggesting whenever we find

532
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:18,470
something is a new project to fix

533
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:22,250
whatever we found or to continue going

534
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:25,610
forward in a better way I'm enclosing

535
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:28,360
and I wow I went quick hold on let me

536
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,360
drink the rest of this

537
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,020
yes you probably should here you know

538
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:47,450
what you should just have them yes there

539
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:47,450
you go yes it's disgusting

540
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:11,580
sir how did that taste thank you thanks

541
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:15,480
to that did you know fun fact you can

542
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,970
have six NES on a firewall because a

543
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,800
certain company who I will not mention

544
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,090
decided that you have is so it's even

545
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,669
right so five it's an uneven number

546
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,169
right so you have it configured on one

547
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,340
side where you have address address and

548
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,040
so used your source and there's your

549
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:34,199
destination and then you have the other

550
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:35,159
yields so user service application there

551
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,900
are six of them

552
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,280
I always forget the sixth one because

553
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,110
it's over on the source side and I was

554
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,910
like why would anybody ever do that and

555
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,560
it was just a slight comfort to me when

556
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,620
I found the five that I didn't find six

557
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:50,490
um but it is possible so if you ever see

558
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,080
it tweet me about it I will send you

559
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,240
stickers and probably like bake you

560
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,800
cookies and a sympathy cake like because

561
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,210
that's just atrocious and you should

562
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,899
never never go through something like

563
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:03,240
that um so kind of to wrap up and I'll

564
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,880
actually say a little bit more here

565
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,280
because I I think it's important and

566
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,130
there there's strategy around this so

567
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,690
sea levels are people like us some of

568
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,920
them have a very very diverse technical

569
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,990
background some of them don't some of

570
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,410
them went to business school there are

571
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,450
all walks of it and approaches to them

572
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:25,140
should be as formulaic as you approach

573
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:36,990
your work and the reason I say that

574
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:40,880
I'm gonna keep yes yep no and it tastes

575
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,880
like warm whatever the fuck

576
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:49,709
so the the reason I say it's formulaic

577
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:52,740
is because repeatable process is

578
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,780
important and you're almost like doing a

579
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,610
Pavlovian experiment with your sea level

580
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,010
and this is not a social engineering

581
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,260
talk but it almost should be because if

582
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,270
you find out what works for them it's

583
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,400
gonna work again so if you find out the

584
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,960
graph or chart they like if you find out

585
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,760
the bullet points they like the style

586
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,650
that they like your email like do

587
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,840
research on it when do you get the yes

588
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,160
how much did you include how much did

589
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,889
you have to include don't overwork

590
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,160
yourself work smarter not harder and so

591
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,360
create a formula and a plan of attack

592
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,460
make sure that you are feeding your

593
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,790
other team members because we're all

594
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,270
important you know we couldn't exist

595
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:32,159
without red red could exist without blue

596
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:34,740
you know and and none of us could we

597
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:39,419
would all be screaming if we didn't have

598
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:41,580
our engineers for our firewalls and and

599
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,350
what have you and they also drive make

600
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,720
friends with them they also drive like

601
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,629
you know equipment purchases and stuff

602
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,660
like that so you know make sure that

603
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:54,179
you're you're you're coming together and

604
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:57,000
you're you're kind of testing out this

605
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:59,400
idea of how am I going to communicate to

606
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,919
them and including everything in it do

607
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,630
something in a business document make it

608
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,900
a PDF make it pretty people like pretty

609
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:08,910
things you know it's we all put stickers

610
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,450
on our laptops you know so kind of do it

611
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:15,299
like that be tenacious about it so

612
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:17,130
metric your failures to create wins and

613
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,629
that's something with the how many

614
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,900
tickets am i working on this the same

615
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:25,169
stuff that we're not tuning where are we

616
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,450
getting pushback on like hey I have a

617
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:29,520
firewall and it's collecting peak hats

618
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,440
on the same infrastructure that it's

619
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,650
running on I really want to have an ass

620
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,320
that I point this to but I've been told

621
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:40,180
now okay so document

622
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,100
what you're not seeing and then what you

623
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:45,550
have to do to get around that and and

624
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:47,620
and like do do a research study on

625
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,450
whatever that failure whatever impact

626
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,870
that failure has and then present it

627
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,820
later I know is not necessarily a

628
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:58,169
permanent no when it comes to making

629
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:02,439
security better so be tenacious about it

630
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:03,730
that said you can't win them all if you

631
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,370
could none of us would have ever

632
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,660
switched jobs we'd be so happy and we'd

633
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,870
still be in the same environments we

634
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:13,480
started it so no one to walk away if

635
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,280
you're in an environment that isn't

636
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,050
listening to the solutions you're giving

637
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,700
and you're following all of this advice

638
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,919
and you're providing charts and you're

639
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,480
providing risk analysis and impact and I

640
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,730
really mean doing your best this isn't

641
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,200
just like hey I told them that maybe we

642
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,600
shouldn't have pie venues on a fire wall

643
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,820
and they just didn't get it and you know

644
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,169
so so go above and beyond a little bit

645
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,510
but if you're still getting that

646
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,810
pushback and you know that your

647
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:39,250
environment is a raging dumpster fire

648
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,320
don't put your name on that like don't

649
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,760
continue to torture yourself talk to the

650
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,500
people around you in the industry and

651
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,690
see if you can't make it better where

652
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,400
can you go to effect change and get the

653
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,840
some filament you need out of your

654
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,190
career because we all do this because we

655
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,169
love it and then no matter what make

656
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,750
memes share laughs never stop loving

657
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:01,780
what you do it's so important like don't

658
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:05,380
get burnout you know we're we're not

659
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,600
good at what we do when we don't care so

660
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,160
if you find yourself that you've stopped

661
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,740
caring and you're getting too many

662
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,240
failures definitely move on and reach

663
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,730
out to this community everybody in this

664
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,430
room reach out to them because they care

665
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,560
just as as much to buy a ticket come out

666
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,150
to Derby con and spend a weekend not

667
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,669
talking about like number not at

668
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:26,410
Disneyland you know we're we're talking

669
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:32,260
about technical things we're talking

670
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:34,690
about work so never stop and that's

671
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,700
pretty much it I included for everybody

672
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,140
a house you for Gantt charts if you

673
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,350
choose to torture yourself with this it

674
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:44,590
is very effective for a road mapping but

675
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,480
it is a little bit of self torture um my

676
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:49,770
slides were designed by my best friend

677
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,420
in Florida I am sort of woman I mean

678
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,850
review and Generation thank you to so

679
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,030

stole from or who helped out and

681
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:01,680
curating and then I really really wanted

682
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,840
to dedicate this to my dogs hackers

683
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:09,980
family using this front row right there

684
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:12,629
[Applause]

685
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,220
if you don't have a hacker family come

686
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,370
see these folks in the front row and

687
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:42,020
move to Dallas they're great does

688
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:54,540
anybody have any questions yes um yes

689
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:58,920
okay so Danny asked sure you use your

690
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:00,330
name on Twitter Danny asked who's

691
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,790
sitting right here in the front row if

692
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,889
you want to come talk to him afterwards

693
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:07,020
what is it when is the time he also

694
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:09,390
offended me a blazing-hot

695
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,090
I so whatever I'm gonna do what I want

696
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:15,270
um he asked if there was a time if I had

697
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:18,179
a story of one I absolutely met complete

698
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:20,370
resistance from the sea level just feet

699
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,880
in the ground and what I did to change

700
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:27,510
their minds and if anything actually

701
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,890
worked trying to think of one this

702
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:33,510
that's really solid it's it's probably

703
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:36,770
it's probably that end point one that I

704
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:41,580
said was the hill I was gonna die on so

705
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:44,010
had a hat an organization that was very

706
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,870
much tied to the the product they were

707
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:50,010
using and in love with it and had drunk

708
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:53,790
all the kool-aid and they were so afraid

709
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:57,870
of network downtime that they wouldn't

710
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:59,370
monitor or tune their network they were

711
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:02,899
letting everything get detected on

712
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:06,498
endpoint and so I tried to point out

713
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:09,830
and no product is a Silver Bullet stuff

714
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:11,989
can get around it and once you're

715
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,299
through the network that's already of

716
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:16,429
reach like they're there in like

717
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:18,019
something has come in even if it's a

718
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:19,969
script even if it's a fish something

719
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:22,099
chopped down you know that's something

720
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:24,859
entering your environment that shouldn't

721
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:27,979
be there so consider it that way

722
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:29,330
fat shit's already happening I kept

723
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:33,169
getting pushback like what's gonna

724
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:37,039
happen to the business so the way I

725
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:39,859
effected change is I went okay stuffs

726
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:43,519
not going to happen at the macro level

727
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:47,330
so let's affect the micro level so I

728
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:50,330
found that the firewalls were configured

729
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:52,639
to default on a specific kind of

730
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:55,879
firewall that I shall not mention to

731
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:58,488
send a reset flag instead of trough when

732
00:33:55,879 --> 00:34:01,399
I was blocking so it was waving and

733
00:33:58,489 --> 00:34:03,379
saying hello to anybody that sent an

734
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:05,238
attack and saying hey there there is a

735
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:09,319
server here you should keep trying and

736
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:13,309
so I took I took one IP address that I

737
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:14,808
was like oh this is from a country you

738
00:34:13,309 --> 00:34:18,440
know that probably doesn't like us very

739
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:20,510
much and it looks pretty obviously

740
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,549
malicious so and they were trying China

741
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,889
chopper so I was like oh okay this is

742
00:34:22,549 --> 00:34:26,869
easy I was like what happened when we

743
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:28,940
send the reset flag and I saw a

744
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:31,039
Christmas tree of like a text right

745
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,599
after it and I was like here's my point

746
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,700
that I'm gonna prove and so I wrote a

747
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:36,770
report and I was very proud of this

748
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:41,109
report and do you know what happened I

749
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:44,059
got that one IP blocked of it fell so

750
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:46,730
that's about it so if you can't affect

751
00:34:44,059 --> 00:34:48,579
the big go small and like just just take

752
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,839
little ones and be positive about it

753
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:53,500
that's really it does anybody have any

754
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,500
other questions

755
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:56,559
yes

756
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:04,609
[Laughter]

757
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:08,599
so default was turned on so it was good

758
00:35:04,609 --> 00:35:13,098
we did have logs to look at however it

759
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:15,740
also comes with either single or partial

760
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:19,309
or single or multi packet capture and

761
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:21,339
that was turned off so can't can't have

762
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:37,930
it all

763
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:43,759
anything else so first I go to the bar

764
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:47,450
and no I so when I I did not fully

765
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:52,390
procrastinate I had all of this outlined

766
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:55,700
in writing before I did any of it and so

767
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,990
when I generate my memes I I'm gonna

768
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,759
answer this like it's a serious question

769
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:02,959
because I have a belly full of ice and

770
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:06,290
it's terrible I I actually just sit

771
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,960
around with friends and I say hey have

772
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,190
you ever seen something this terrible

773
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,390
there's probably a meme for that we

774
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,190
should make one and like that's

775
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:17,450
legitimately how we generate means and

776
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:21,470
actually I want to go back to one so if

777
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:25,790
I can get there ah this one hold on wait

778
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:29,089
nope this this is not mine this is

779
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:31,190
somebody I used to work with and this is

780
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:32,930
the pain we felt this is an old me like

781
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:39,950
we've we've had this around for a while

782
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:42,319
and it is it was a Friday after hours

783
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,399
and so like memes just happened and

784
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:45,349
that's why I kind of one of the

785
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,359
encouraging factors of being here at

786
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:49,160
Derby con and with a bunch of friends is

787
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,700
like just you know sit around and do

788
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,700
stuff like this
