1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,510
I know there's people in the room that

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:05,510
are like challenge accepted

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:13,469
alright so a couple of quick notes about

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,480
this talk first I wrote it at 5 a.m.

5
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,009
this morning I know there's people like

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,869
a lot of you are like well that's

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,740
expected

8
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:21,810
that's way John does all of his

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,430
presentations the other thing this has

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,979
been kind of a rough week not just

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,930
because it's the end of Derby con I lost

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,340
my aunt at the beginning of the week her

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,469
funerals right now and and also I've

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,450
been sick so I apologize if I'm a little

15
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,460
bit off I might be a little bit more

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,230
subdued and less insane than normal

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,170
maybe it's all for the best for

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,788
presenting anyway so let's get into it

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,809
we need to have a conversation or at

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,020
least continue having conversations

21
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,870
whatever it comes to cyber attribution

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,899
and cyber deception one of the things I

23
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,239
constantly hear still to this day and I

24
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,980
believe my first Derby con presentation

25
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,750
was on this topic so I thought it was

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,760
fitting that my last Derby con

27
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,830
presentation would be on this topic and

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,048
it's getting better but we still have

29
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,210
conversations like this where Brian

30
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,549
Krebs says deception technologies are

31
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,949
nice but advisable only if your

32
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,930
organization is already doing 99% of the

33
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,580
rest of the basic security stuff as it

34
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,520
happens a lot of the really cool tech at

35
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,539
Advertiser RSA is for a very exclusive

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,539
audience and he's wrong I hate to call

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,009
out Brian Krebs because that's not

38
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,009
that's not a fight I'm gonna win

39
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:38,360
that's not that's not going to work but

40
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,830
I'm gonna make my case on the next slide

41
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,039
it's kind of like arguing with Bruce

42
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,360
Schneier at once on security weekly and

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,920
it's in the archives Bruce Schneier

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,240
literally was arguing with me on

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,440
cross-site scripting across Erika's

46
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,850
forgery and he said something to the

47
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:55,789
effect of but I'm Bruce Schneier I'm

48
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:58,639
like well crap I'm done Jeff Moss found

49
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,340
her a black hat and DEF CON also a

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,910
really really smart person was that

51
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,770
black hat Europe last year and he said

52
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,209
one interesting omission Moss said was

53
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,850
the apparent lack of use of deception

54
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,530
technology I never heard one speaker say

55
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,780
and then I checked my canary or I

56
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,540
reviewed the deception tech who here

57
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,160
uses deception technology and like three

58
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,350
or four people in the audience about the

59
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,660
size maybe larger raise their hands and

60
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,000
it's like we'll see deceptions crap and

61
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:30,380
I don't necessarily believe that that's

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,720
the case either honestly when we're

63
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,730
looking at deception technology it's not

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,609
like you go up to a company air you guys

65
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:40,609
using deception technology like yes yes

66
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:46,070
we do you've just missed the point of

67
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:51,200
deception technology but a lot of us in

68
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:52,690
this industry we grew up and the idea of

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,820
even getting the basics and fundamentals

70
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,489
we never really got that and that's

71
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,380
important and I want to explain why if

72
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,970
you've been in this industry for about

73
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,880
twenty years

74
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,430
please raise your hand okay cool

75
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,370
God we're all old

76
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,540
now of all of you that just raise your

77
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,040
hand and you've been in this industry

78
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,200
for 20 years the crap that we were

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,599
trying to get work 20 years ago is it

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,879
working now

81
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,950
no we're still fighting the damn things

82
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,179
it's like I need help with my firewall

83
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,879
configuration shouldn't that have been

84
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,090
worked out like in the mid-90s no

85
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:31,429
apparently not so we have this tendency

86
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,099
to kind of focus on the things that we

87
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:37,220
know firewalls ids/ips things like that

88
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:39,018
and askew away from things that it would

89
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,319
be considered new even though deception

90
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:45,409
technology is clearly not new so the

91
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,000
purpose of this conversation today is I

92
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:49,370
want to be on the record and I want to

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,139
say we use deception technology and we

94
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,730
checked the canary tokens and I also

95
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,189
want to share with you not necessarily

96
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,560
the names of customers but as a pen

97
00:03:55,189 --> 00:04:00,409
testing firm we see deception technology

98
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,150
the varying levels of effectiveness but

99
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:04,429
let's go through and get started let's

100
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,379
start out with Brian Krebs once again

101
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,879
making it very clear Brian Krebs I love

102
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,540
you what you do for the industry is

103
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,840
awesome

104
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,160
but you were wrong and the reason why I

105
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,160
had this slide I used to have the

106
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:20,149
Verizon data breach report from 2013 and

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,949
it's not 2013 anymore and earlier this

108
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,380
year I had someone that pulled the

109
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:26,210
detection methods out of a recent

110
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,880
Verizon data breach report can actually

111
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,400
query that data directly and there's a

112
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,669
bunch of things on this slide that are

113
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,239
indications of exactly where the state

114
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:41,090
of security is in relation to the

115
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,500
technologies that we use I'm gonna focus

116
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,448
all the way over on the large

117
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,070
organizations I know we have some small

118
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:49,250
organizations represented here in this

119
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,539
room but the vast majority of the people

120
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,520
that are in this room work for companies

121
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:55,880
that can afford to send people to Derby

122
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,680
con and let's kind of focus on that one

123
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,389
of the things that concerns me is at the

124
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,330
top if we look at how organizations

125
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:06,500
detect their compromised the top one by

126
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:08,960
far in a way is 42.9% and it's external

127
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,849
monitoring services or MS SPS

128
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,549
so how many of you in this room or

129
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:17,029
penetration testers what will raise your

130
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,800
hands cool awesome now how often - MS

131
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:25,010
ESPYs actually catch you

132
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,390
very rarely right years ago we used to

133
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,570
well I'm not going to mention the vendor

134
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,310
they're actually here but we had this

135
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,080
problem where one of the vendors

136
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,790
couldn't even detect clear text command

137
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,740
and control like netcat see it's gonna

138
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,470
be in the presentation Edie absolutely

139
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,240
keeping the fire live and clear tex

140
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,210
netcat command and control and they

141
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,250
wouldn't detect it and finally I started

142
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,229
writing little things like hey people at

143
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,270
company X if you can detect this please

144
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,270
call me and they never did

145
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,060
I guess they wrote a signature for my

146
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,530
name though because one of our customers

147
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,900
whenever I did that like yeah we got a

148
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,789
signature it on the c2 on your name hi

149
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,549
this is John strand call me so that

150
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:07,340
concerns me because by and large most MS

151
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,900
SPS don't do very well and the other

152
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,960
thing that concerns me is if you notice

153
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,460
a bunch of these are external I went

154
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,020
through and I put read around all of

155
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,950
them in the top one should be read as

156
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,990
well something like over 65% of all the

157
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,390
detects in the Verizon data breach

158
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,960
report from last year were from external

159
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:28,460
entities it was not a technology that

160
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,140
was super awesome whiz-bang that they

161
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,659
had purchased they didn't purchase an

162
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:36,110
awesome firewall IDs system IPS system

163
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,210
it was somebody else outside of the

164
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,580
organization detected the incident and

165
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,500
this sucks

166
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,780
because all those old people in the

167
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,480
Greybeards and this is very very near to

168
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,010
be Greybeards we've been trying to get a

169
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,070
lot of this technology to work for over

170
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:54,440
20 years and it's still not working as

171
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,240
much as we would like it to work and I

172
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,160
also want to make it clear that I'm not

173
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,080
saying that deception technology is

174
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,790
going to fix that and we can replace

175
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,890
everything I'm just saying whenever

176
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:08,090
we're looking at security today we've

177
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:10,340
all been granted a set of tools and we

178
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,830
believe that those are the only tools

179
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,539
that are available to us and we need to

180
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,180
start looking a little bit differently

181
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,260
on the tools that we can use we

182
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,640
shouldn't just be looking at standard

183
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:24,349
ids/ips firewalls a a V EDR UVA and all

184
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,270
those different things because those

185
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,550
things are fine it's just they

186
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,210
absolutely do have some gaps so let's

187
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,960
get started

188
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,409
so another useless threat on another

189
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,138
useless

190
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:37,938
rant on threat intelligence feeds many

191
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:39,830
of you attend our webcasts or have been

192
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:41,539
to a class by me you know my feelings on

193
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,519
these I think threat intelligence feeds

194
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:46,369
are complete garbage at least the way

195
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:49,339
that most organizations use them and the

196
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:52,519
reason why I believe that is because

197
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:56,149
they are but the reason why I believe

198
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:59,209
that is because the whole concept is

199
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:01,009
fundamentally broken you go back years

200
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:02,479
ago into the 90s bringing up Marcus

201
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:04,159
Ranum the sixth dumbest ideas of

202
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,279
computer security and one of those six

203
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:09,050
dumbest ideas was blacklisting and many

204
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:13,129
threat intelligence feeds are merely

205
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:15,559
more complicated black lists we don't

206
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:17,479
ever encounter a customer where they're

207
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:18,709
like God they caught bhi us because of

208
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,979
their threat intelligence feed it

209
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:23,539
doesn't work that way and recently one

210
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:24,849
of the data breach reports from like

211
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:27,589
mandiant or Verizon I can't remember

212
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,909
they went and they checked of all the

213
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:30,589
threat intelligence feeds how much

214
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:32,269
overlap that they actually have does

215
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:33,318
anyone know what their overlap of a

216
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,889
whole bunch of different threat

217
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:41,509
intelligence feeds were no it wasn't

218
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:44,839
zero was but no it was an 80% it was

219
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:46,310
like 10 percent that three percent was a

220
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,630
different report but I do remember that

221
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,189
one but it was ten percent on being

222
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,959
generous so do you know what the

223
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:54,199
recommendation of the report was when it

224
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:58,910
came to threat intelligence feeds by all

225
00:08:54,199 --> 00:09:00,709
of them but let's back up and let's

226
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,329
figure out what the goal is of a threat

227
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,250
intelligence feat a goal is to try to

228
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:08,229
learn about attackers right there's this

229
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:11,029
huge like lack of knowledge of what

230
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,139
offensive cyber actually looks like even

231
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:14,149
though a bunch of people at this

232
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,579
conference are very much red team

233
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:18,740
focused IDI and I have probably taught

234
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:20,959
more people on offensive capabilities

235
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,970
than anybody else on the planet but

236
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,589
there's always more and whenever we're

237
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,149
teaching our classes we always have

238
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:29,680
these students that come up to us and

239
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:33,740
they're like IDI is it really this easy

240
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,239
yeah kind of is but we're buying this

241
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,189
intelligence to get a better

242
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,290
understanding and maybe there's a better

243
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:40,730
way that we can get intelligence but

244
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,740
it's not something that we purchase or

245
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,529
something that's old it's not months out

246
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,959
of date but something that's more up

247
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,910
to what we're doing now a little bit

248
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,410
about attackers especially when you're

249
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,449
dealing with nation state level

250
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,649
attackers if you I'm not gonna have

251
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:56,469
anybody raising their hands for this but

252
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:58,810
if you have ever done cyber offensive

253
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,160
operations for a government the United

254
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,399
States government or any other

255
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,379
governments if Chinese government if

256
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,379
you're here raise your hand everyone in

257
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:10,809
this room owes you a beer we just want

258
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:13,540
to say thank you we appreciate it

259
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:17,170
Russian government's huh once again we

260
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,870
probably owe you as well you owe them a

261
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,719
vodka right so some people are like no

262
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,999
you owe me vodka right but they have one

263
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,579
rule and that rule is don't get caught

264
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:30,129
don't get caught don't get caught that's

265
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:31,959
the rule right and that means that

266
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,490
there's a higher level of paranoia with

267
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,410
a lot of these attackers that they just

268
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,720
do not want to get caught but the risk

269
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,129
of getting caught is very low for many

270
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,100
of them but if we could increase that

271
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:43,360
risk we are actually going to impact the

272
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,079
speed at which they're taking over

273
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,809
organizations as well so getting started

274
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,029
canary tokens canary tokens org from

275
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:53,740
thinkest has is amazing you can actually

276
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,509
go to their website I'm sure we'll end

277
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,610
up bombing it with everybody going there

278
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:59,470
right now but you can download canary

279
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,629
tokens and you can run it in your own

280
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,790
organization and we have we actually

281
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:05,529
have set up canary tokens and we have it

282
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,759
running @bh is and we have a number of

283
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,850
customers that are running it because

284
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:12,129
it's stupid easy they have made it very

285
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,959
very very simple to set up token

286
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:16,180
technologies let's go through some of

287
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,729
them also some of the technology is in

288
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,709
ADHD the active defends harbinger

289
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,990
distribution and you can pull that down

290
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:25,420
at Black Hills InfoSec calm Ford /

291
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,759
projects ADHD don't pull it down today

292
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,370
though 1 we don't want to crash the

293
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,009
network here at the hotel again but

294
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,800
we're going to be releasing an update as

295
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:37,179
soon as I get home the week after next

296
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,370
I've got a whole update that I did just

297
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:42,819
for my class that I ran the last two

298
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,769
days so scenario recon if we go through

299
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:47,469
attack phases and cover how an attacker

300
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:49,959
will go after an organization we have an

301
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,670
entire class on that for days dedicated

302
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,500
to it there's a number of things that we

303
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,089
can cover very quickly and the goal of

304
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,439
the different technologies and

305
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,470
techniques that I'm going to talk about

306
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:59,719
are things that

307
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,430
you all can set up in your organization

308
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,870
without bringing in attorneys and not

309
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,150
having to go through crazy change

310
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,190
management talking about impact to the

311
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,260
organization and oh we're gonna stand up

312
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,540
full high interaction honeypot servers

313
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,569
but rather trying to come up with stupid

314
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,980
simple things that you can turn on very

315
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,140
quickly and get some level of

316
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,660
attributional technology and deception

317
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,960
technology working the first one I'd

318
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,959
like to talk about is AWS keys I have on

319
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,540
the next slide here in a little bit the

320
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,700
the number of security firms that are

321
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,010
simply crawling the entire internet and

322
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,220
looking for open s3 buckets or keys that

323
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:39,830
are on github repositories is disturbing

324
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,330
if you are one of those firms where

325
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,550
you're crawling the internet constantly

326
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:46,840
looking for open as three buckets and

327
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:50,569
keys that are exposed you are jackasses

328
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,710
I'm gonna be blunt about that and don't

329
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,320
don't get me wrong we love ourselves

330
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,670
some stunts hacking that's great but if

331
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
you're trolling the internet finding

332
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,240
open s3 buckets you're like look at all

333
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,860
this data we found and you run right to

334
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,310
the reporters to actually disclose it

335
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,370
publicly

336
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,829
that's not novel you're not really doing

337
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,940
anybody a favor there are some

338
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,100
researchers that are working very

339
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,900
diligently to come up with tools to

340
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,510
improve the security of people to

341
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,819
identify if they have s3 buckets and

342
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,520
things in a Google cloud computer that

343
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,680
are exposed and that's what we need so

344
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,380
let's catch them so what you can do is

345
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,150
you can generate a token and you can put

346
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,420
this up on a github repository and

347
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,890
basically call it something like

348
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,290
super-secret AWS keys and make it

349
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,230
completely publicly exposed and then in

350
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,270
its hacker will try to run or access

351
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,450
that s3 bucket with something like s3

352
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,770
Explorer and if they try to jump in it's

353
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,300
gonna say unable to perform this

354
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,490
requested action you can't get to this

355
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,099
bucket sorry but in the background

356
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,720
you'll get an alert and notification and

357
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,990
it'll actually pop up and say that

358
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,660
somebody is trying to access this bucket

359
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,760
this is s3 bucket that you have and you

360
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,250
can see the IP address and the date/time

361
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,680
stamp now to be completely honest with

362
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,570
you trying to do geolocation based on IP

363
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,189
address is problematic a little bit

364
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,500
later on in the presentation I'm going

365
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,190
to give you some tips on how you can get

366
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,090
a little bit

367
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:16,040
more refined resolution into where an IP

368
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,780
address is so if you have something like

369
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,329
this and it says this is the IP address

370
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,800
it's usually off by quite a bit and I'll

371
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,240
demonstrate that and show you how you

372
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,829
can get a little bit closer and get a

373
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,770
little bit more accurate with

374
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:30,020
identifying the IP addresses once again

375
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,870
that context is I a couple of articles

376
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,250
up here you see them all the time

377
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,720
where people are talking about oh look

378
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,820
at all this data that's available in

379
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,530
Amazon you have the decipher website

380
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,170
which I've got to be honest with you I

381
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,270
actually love the content to decipher

382
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,920
but their color scheme it makes my eyes

383
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:49,400
bleed

384
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,370
it is absolutely horrific somebody needs

385
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,439
to change that immediately all right

386
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,180
executables how can we actually come up

387
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,160
with an executable and get an attacker

388
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,359
to actually run that executable this is

389
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,630
something we just got done talking about

390
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,170
in class so it is very common for

391
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:09,320
organizations to share executables in

392
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,900
particular for VPNs right so you can say

393
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,210
Union in order to access our VPN you

394
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,730
have to use this specific version of our

395
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,760
VPN software and they share that client

396
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,620
out someplace it is absolutely possible

397
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,990
to put some geolocation and some

398
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,130
tracking inside of those executables

399
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,790
whether or not you're doing it for

400
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:31,010
legitimate usage of those VPNs or if you

401
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,930
want to stand up a fake VPN service and

402
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,750
have some type of attribution associated

403
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,209
with it so you can create these

404
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,160
executables put them out on the internet

405
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,710
somewhere where an attacker would run

406
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,449
across them a helpdesk folder or share

407
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,740
someplace and then they would download

408
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,470
them run them and then you were able to

409
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,420
identify that IP address right there

410
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,250
is somebody who's interacting with

411
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,990
something they shouldn't and this

412
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,820
becomes a theme in the rest of this

413
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:59,030
presentation that cyber threat

414
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,040
intelligence folks not a story about you

415
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,100
know this company got hacked using this

416
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,990
particular technique in Ohio we can see

417
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,970
well this particular IP address right

418
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:09,980
now just downloaded something that no

419
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,600
one should ever interact with and we now

420
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,790
have a connection directly from that IP

421
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,089
address they're the ones that are coming

422
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,290
after you and that's great because when

423
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,450
you're buying threat intelligence feeds

424
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,880
and you have IP addresses or even hashes

425
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,630
the attackers are constantly modifying

426
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,300
their

427
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:29,000
needs to stay in front of the wave of

428
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,319
detection where if you can see what

429
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,300
they're doing right now then it's

430
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:33,729
applicable to your organization the way

431
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,319
that threat intelligence feeds are not

432
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,720
so the set up we just create an

433
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:41,509
executable binary profile you can upload

434
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,250
any executable of your choice I just did

435
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,230
Rufus for this just because it was in my

436
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,779
drop or not my Dropbox my downloads

437
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,850
folder threw it up and then a little bit

438
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:52,490
later it generates the canary token I

439
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,370
can download it and then if you run it I

440
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:58,399
called it free candy because hey why not

441
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:00,620
and then it pops up and it says the

442
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,389
signed executable we have the source IP

443
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,369
address gives us the date the date/time

444
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,569
stamp is my audio getting weaker I don't

445
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:08,359
know someone's turning it down or it's

446
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:10,069
just going away but now we have a lot of

447
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:12,260
information about who actually executed

448
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:14,809
it but the problem I have with this one

449
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,299
is the channel for the callback is

450
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:20,178
actually DNS the way canary tokens works

451
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:22,250
is some of the Canaries will be connect

452
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:25,130
Li to an IP address and other Canaries

453
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,319
will resolve a name a host name and you

454
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,809
can pick that up and do some tracking

455
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:32,379
based on the resolution of that hostname

456
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:35,418
DNS resolution is not all that great

457
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:38,330
wouldn't it be better if we actually had

458
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:41,210
a real executable whose sole purpose in

459
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:43,039
life was doing geolocation and I'll show

460
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,740
you we actually released him some code

461
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,289
here that actually does just that as

462
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:52,250
well then the other thing that we can do

463
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:54,110
is why not make it real almost any VPN

464
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,390
software that anybody in this room is

465
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,760
actually running they have scripts that

466
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:02,059
can execute whenever somebody logs into

467
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,190
that VPN so why go through the effort of

468
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:06,530
trying to create an executable that's

469
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,539
going to do geolocation and do all these

470
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,490
different things when instead you can

471
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:13,580
just use the built-in functionality of

472
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,370
your VPN and I'm just using Open VPN as

473
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,470
an example with Open VPN you can it set

474
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,408
up scripts that as soon as somebody

475
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:24,980
authenticates you will run PowerShell

476
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:28,580
you can run Python you can run Program

477
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,330
Files of cmd.exe from the system itself

478
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,580
and then you can just use your

479
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,100
imagination insofar as what you want

480
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,689
from any systems that connect now I get

481
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,399
questions all the time they're like well

482
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,260
wait a minute how do we differentiate

483
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,360
Queen our users and anybody that's

484
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,840
trying to attack you do this in two ways

485
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,100
one you can fire it for every single

486
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,220
connection that's made in through your

487
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,959
VPN and that would be just fine there's

488
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,060
no problems with that because you're at

489
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,250
least collecting that log data and that

490
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,590
telemetry so you can see what is going

491
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,510
on the other thing you could do is you

492
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,730
could stand up an Open VPN instance

493
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,770
that's not connected into your

494
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,140
environment I think that that last part

495
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:09,110
is really important and anytime an

496
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,150
attacker tries to download open VPN in

497
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,860
run Open VPN it's running someplace

498
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,140
other than your organisation but you're

499
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,550
getting full location and attributional

500
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,410
information about the attacker that

501
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,260
actually connected to that Open VPN

502
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,360
system so far none of this as long as

503
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,610
you aren't running like download and

504
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,199
execute meterpreter if you're just

505
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,550
trying to trace route if you're just

506
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,130
trying to get IP address information

507
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:34,850
you're just trying to find out where the

508
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,860
attacker is you're probably ok I'm not

509
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,800
going into laws very much in this

510
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,580
presentation at all but a great ruling

511
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:46,070
is US vs Jerome hacking camp and in that

512
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,929
the judge ruled it is one thing to track

513
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,700
a computer system by its IP address or

514
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,360
geolocation information in an effort to

515
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,520
track it down

516
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,889
it is something else entirely different

517
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,620
to violate federal wiretapping laws to

518
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,030
do so so that's a bright shiny line if

519
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,100
you're gonna try to implement any of

520
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:03,530
these things make sure it's set up for

521
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,290
IP address and locational information

522
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,629
because very least you'll have some case

523
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:12,200
studies and some case law that you can

524
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,370
actually lean upon as well so some ways

525
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,650
that you can do this you can actually

526
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,739
put these executables in a variety of

527
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,960
different of like directories on your

528
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,390
web server disallow no index no follow

529
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,330
for all user agent strings registration

530
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:29,150
and admin admin page admin email

531
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,090
whatever places that a normal user would

532
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:35,540
never go to you can actually put them in

533
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:37,639
also you can query wireless networks

534
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,580
that are nearby and you can do this with

535
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,020
net sh WLAN and you can show the

536
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,580
networks and I'm going to share with you

537
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,470
some code that we have written at Black

538
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,840
Hills information security that you can

539
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,970
easily convert into an executable or put

540
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,720
it into a macro and an Excel spreadsheet

541
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,710
that will

542
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,390
trigger and do this type of search based

543
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,130
on the concepts of honey badger and it's

544
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,480
in the honey badger framework but

545
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,400
extending it a little bit so we can

546
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,710
actually get executables and full macros

547
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,049
built into it as well

548
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:09,020
cloned websites I love this one so what

549
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:11,090
you can do is if you have a website that

550
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,780
is an authentication portal it requires

551
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:16,309
user ID and it requires a password you

552
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,740
can put this snippet of code you can

553
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:19,220
actually obfuscate this code fairly

554
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,500
easily

555
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,070
but you put this snippet of code in that

556
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,760
page and then any time an attacker goes

557
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:31,340
through and clones that site as soon as

558
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,890
the site stands up and they stand up PHP

559
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,850
or nginx it's gonna reach out and try to

560
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:39,590
grab the jpg to render that server

561
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,709
properly and you're gonna be able to

562
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:46,370
identify the IP address of that server

563
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:49,820
before a single spam message is sent to

564
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:53,299
you so we run this on our servers

565
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:55,340
attacker clones it you get an alert you

566
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:57,440
add that into the block list for your

567
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,840
email gateway and now or even on your

568
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,750
egress leaving your environment and now

569
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,879
you're never going to see those emails

570
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,309
from that spearfishing server hit your

571
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,530
inboxes and if somebody tries to go

572
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,450
through it you can block it and I go

573
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,830
back to cyber threat intelligence right

574
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,880
well we're gonna buy cyber threat

575
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,320
intelligence so we're gonna say well

576
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,299
here's all the different websites though

577
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,370
we use for spear phishing attacks

578
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:22,879
we should block those those were used

579
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:26,780
last week those were used a month ago

580
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,909
the attackers have moved on if you do

581
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,500
this you're getting attribution and

582
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:31,880
cyber threat intelligence for an

583
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,700
attacker that's going after your

584
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,200
organization right now and you're

585
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,840
stopping that attack before it even

586
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,880
starts and that's ultimately what we're

587
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,158
trying to get so this is actually one of

588
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,440
the technologies that we run at Black

589
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,330
Hills information security because I

590
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,309
want to be able to say we checked our

591
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,990
deception technology and we saw our

592
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,360
alerts because now we're on the record

593
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:55,640
somebody's actually saying that so we

594
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,199
receive these periodically I'll show you

595
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,330
a map that shows all the ones that we've

596
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,549
gotten in the past year but we're able

597
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,460
to actually go through and set up

598
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:06,590
filters so these sites are not

599
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,630
possible so people can't get to them or

600
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:11,120
we can basically filter emails that come

601
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,860
in with links going to these websites as

602
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,679
well this is awesome

603
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,389
this is easy this is not setting up a

604
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,060
honeypot and watching that honeypot

605
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:23,060
closely this is not setting up a full

606
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,919
windows 2003 box to see if a hacker can

607
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,320
break into it this is stuff that I think

608
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,480
we all should be doing because this is

609
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,820
the cyber like threat intelligence that

610
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,610
matters far more than anything that you

611
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,980
can actually purchase so this is the

612
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,810
history I just pulled this this morning

613
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,190
these are all the different IP addresses

614
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,840
that have cloned the Black Hills

615
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,890
Information Security website that I've

616
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:48,620
stood up all over the place so yeah this

617
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,810
works so we checked our cyber deception

618
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,239
technology and we checked our tokens and

619
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,740
this is what we actually saw and it

620
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,030
works pretty well by the way I know some

621
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,430
of you are like I can't wait till he

622
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:01,010
releases the slides I'm gonna remove the

623
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:03,680
bar now I took screenshots of the

624
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,850
picture with the bar so that's it's not

625
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,870
going to show you guys were laughing

626
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,149
because they know that's what you were

627
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,570
gonna do because I've done it in the

628
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:13,280
past

629
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:15,620
alright so word Docs um so I actually

630
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,730
used the slide in this picture from dr.

631
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:21,439
Seuss in one of my presentations and you

632
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,910
know we had the would you run it from a

633
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,800
share would you run it from a chair

634
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:26,390
would you run it from tor if the FBI

635
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,800
comes should you open the door and they

636
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,700
were like you should just write a hole

637
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:34,340
dr. Seuss book like that maybe if I have

638
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,740
more time right we can actually use Word

639
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,360
documents and we can track Word

640
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,190
documents whenever they open we talked

641
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,439
about this a number of years ago at my

642
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,820
first Derby con and I wanted to share

643
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,200
that with you and kind of give you some

644
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,310
additional technologies and techniques

645
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,290
that you all can use this has been

646
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,360
around forever and it works really

647
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:52,310
really well you put documents up

648
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,629
someplace where they shouldn't be like

649
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,520
for example let's say you're a pen

650
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:58,190
testing firm you could create a website

651
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,410
called files dot pen testing firm comm

652
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,670
and you could load these files up there

653
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,250
and make them look like I don't know

654
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,900
reports from customers and see you is

655
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,250
actually crawling around trying to find

656
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,020
your reports pulling down those

657
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,030
documents opening those documents and

658
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,620
find the people that are actively going

659
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,860
after your pen testing company

660
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:18,350
hypothetically you could totally do that

661
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,580
so this morning my brother is

662
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,649
staying with me down at the Galt House

663
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,199
and Bryan works with us at Black Hills

664
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:28,700
information security and I got up at

665
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:31,070
5:00 a.m. and I sent him this email it

666
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,929
basically said please open this thanks

667
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,840
with a randomly named document attached

668
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:37,190
to it now any other employee I would

669
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,199
hang out with I would let you guys sleep

670
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,450

671
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,590

676
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:02,419
take the pillow off the top of his head

677
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:03,860
Bryan open this document so he's like

678
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:06,020
what do you want just open your computer

679
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,949
and open this document it's like god

680
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,809
this sucks

681
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:15,500
and he opened up this email and he's

682
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:20,539
like is this legit I'm like now dude

683
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:22,940
open it I don't think I should I think I

684
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:25,070
should call CJ our CEO Oh like no I'm

685
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,090
the owner of the goddamn company in your

686
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,460
older brother

687
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:30,649
open this document or I'm gonna beat you

688
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,440
and it's okay because you're my brother

689
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:37,490
the police will be like carry on all

690
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,929
right so he opens up the document and we

691
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,940
generated the alert and the whole time

692
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,650
he did it he's like I'm failing us I'm

693
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,990
feeling something here like my brother's

694
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:47,110
testing me for social engineering you

695
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:49,220
know at what point will you talk

696
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:52,908
waterboarding next quick into the

697
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:54,590
bathroom I hate waterboarding but yeah

698
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,539
triggers and we actually get the source

699
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:59,928
IP address and I put in the joking

700
00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:04,039
minder of he opened it so that was fun

701
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:07,789
now here's a problem so he opened up

702
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:09,679
this document and the document fired but

703
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:12,260
it's not really all that accurate it put

704
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,080
us way down by Walmart whenever he

705
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:17,150
opened the document on his computer and

706
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,129
he was joined to the hotel wireless

707
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,419
network which once again sorry I tried

708
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,799
to get him to do that we're not supposed

709
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:22,970
to do that I'm like join the hotel

710
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:24,950
wireless network I don't want to join

711
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,390
the hotel wirelessly joining the hotel

712
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,799
wireless network Brian it's just gonna

713
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,260
be if you're for a few seconds I'm gonna

714
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:33,080
call systems on you I'm like oh come on

715
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,780
it's quick let's do it so he opened it

716
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,610
up and that's we're open from now you

717
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,250
know that we're not there we're actually

718
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:42,530
downtown Louisville so that wasn't all

719
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,230
that accurate but I want to share with

720
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,389
you how you can get a little bit better

721
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,710
granularity because that sucks right so

722
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,110
one of the things you can do is trace

723
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,330
route to that particular IP address what

724
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,669
you do is you trace route and then you

725
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,949
take the last routing hop which is at

726
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:01,220
the bottom of the screen and then you

727
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:03,590
take that IP address and you geo locate

728
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,500
that IP address that the reason why this

729
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,929
works is most of the IP addresses for

730
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:12,350
home users in particular those IP

731
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:14,840
addresses are handed out via DHCP so it

732
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:17,060
doesn't really know where you are it's

733
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,100
gonna be within the town maybe if you're

734
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,070
in South Dakota the state but it's gonna

735
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,919
give you this random TCP IP address and

736
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,929
you're gonna be all over the place but

737
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,840
routing infrastructure with routing

738
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:33,680
infrastructure we tend to get a lot

739
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:36,230
closer so you take that last IP address

740
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,120
and you geo locate that instead and

741
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,650
that's where the point of presence is

742
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,709
for routing and as you can see it was

743
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:44,870
about a block away from where we are so

744
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,700
that's pretty cool right so that's gets

745
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,250
us a little bit more accurate I've done

746
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,140
some cyber deception and hacker tracking

747
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,000
classes for the United States military

748
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,380
and it always disturbs me whenever they

749
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,660
look at something like this and are like

750
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,560
oh that's good that's close enough

751
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:07,490
[Applause]

752
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:09,350
what oh god all right but the document

753
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,700
that you generate from canary tokens and

754
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,500
we're planning on contributing to this

755
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,800
project a lot more now that I have some

756
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,600
more time they're not tracking in all

757
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,120
the ways that you should be and that

758
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,429
means that they're tracking doesn't fire

759
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,290
for a lot of Linux document processors

760
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:26,030
LibreOffice and I know people are like

761
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:28,570
whoa you can use Libre Office on Windows

762
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,680
I'm like why the hell would you do that

763
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:34,250
once again if anyone's here from Libre

764
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,740
Office you have one job one job be

765
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,900
compatible with Microsoft Office do that

766
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,570
please they just fail out all the time

767
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,910
so and the active defense harbinger

768
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,399
distribution we have word web bugs

769
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,410
and word web bugs use cascading

770
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,150
stylesheets and they also use image

771
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,950
source tag so you can use both of those

772
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:54,440
and you tend to get a lot more accurate

773
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,480
and a bunch more of the text editors

774
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,549
that are out there will fire so you'll

775
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,500
get a B word will fire libreoffice will

776
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:03,559
fire you'll get Apple TextEdit on some

777
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,450
versions of Mac will fire and then also

778
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,428
Microsoft Word and Microsoft words for

779
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,630
word for Mac or CH for word for Windows

780
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:10,549
it works for all those different

781
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:12,559
versions so this increases the number of

782
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:15,320
document editors that'll actually beacon

783
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,299
back now once again we're not standing

784
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,100
up a honeypot we're not doing any of

785
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:20,658
that we're just creating documents and

786
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,090
seating around the environment seeing o

787
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:26,360
who opens them another way that you can

788
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:30,860
run that god there's a spider I killed

789
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,209
it okay we're good so the other thing

790
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,580
that you can do with this is think in

791
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:36,230
terms of Incident Response if you have a

792
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,840
computer system that you believe to be

793
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,909
compromised you could drop a document on

794
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,740
that computer system like something

795
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:44,570
juicy the attacker is absolutely going

796
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,039
to want to open what would be a good

797
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:50,120
name of a document that an attacker

798
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:52,250
would want to open passwords dot like

799
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:57,199
doc right not that that has ever

800
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:58,850
happened Sony but and by the way I want

801
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,650
to make it very clear we have friends

802
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,750
that worked at Sony security team and

803
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,539
they're awesome they well they were

804
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,549
awesome a lot of them have moved on and

805
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:08,720
there wasn't Sony's fault for years I

806
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:10,010
remember talking with them and like we

807
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,530
want to do the right thing but it's just

808
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,820
it's just budget management they were

809
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,559
not the exception

810
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,270
they were the norm they're much like

811
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:19,668
every other organization but yeah they

812
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:22,760
had documents with passwords dot docx

813
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:24,200
which is very helpful for attackers one

814
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,629
step forward this is one that was

815
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:30,530
contributed by Bo I think I asked you

816
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:32,179
all yesterday at about 5:00 I was like

817
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:34,960
hey you guys have pentose that you had

818
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:36,830
cyber deception and Bo sent me this one

819
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,169
this is a company that was running

820
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:43,158
javelin and I absolutely loved javelin

821
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:44,990
except there's a couple of things once

822
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:47,240
again I love any of the cyber deception

823
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:49,340
vendors that are out there anyone at Evo

824
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,040
allusive all of those they're amazing

825
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:54,168
I'm a Symetra who just got bought so

826
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,159
gati got his company bought which is

827
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:59,720
awesome good for them

828
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,790
but javelin was always a bit weird to me

829
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,680
javelins whole claim to fame is we use

830
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:09,389
machine learning for cyber deception

831
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:14,880
like oh that's cool how well what we use

832
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:23,550
is artificial intelligence to machine

833
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:27,360
learn your network I'm like how in what

834
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:28,919
they did was and what they do is and I'm

835
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,929
picking on him now because they're owned

836
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,340
by Symantec there's a big long history

837
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:36,230
between us and Symantec that goes back

838
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,230
to derbycon about four years ago and

839
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:42,810
what they do is they learn your user

840
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,490
pattern for how you create user accounts

841
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:47,010
like last name first initial force

842
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:49,620
initial last name and also the naming of

843
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:52,500
machines and then they stand up all

844
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,449
kinds of different machines with that

845
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,650
naming convention and user accounts with

846
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:00,510
that naming convention that's it that's

847
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,670
how they use artificial intelligence and

848
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,320
machine learning now just out of

849
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,820
curiosity I mean that's kind of neat but

850
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,710
how many of you could actually name fake

851
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,350
machine accounts and fake user accounts

852
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,940
using your naming convention at work not

853
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,250
enough of you just raised your hands

854
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,780
that's a little bit disturbing thank you

855
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,230
for raising both to kind of help

856
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:21,060
humanity as much as possible

857
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,670
unfortunately Bowe discovered that

858
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,679
whenever you're pulling this information

859
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:28,410
you see the last it's log off time right

860
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:35,910
log off time the last log off time was

861
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:37,410
December 31st 1600 at 7:00 p.m. how the

862
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:40,020
hell do you come up with that type of

863
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:42,210
epoch time right so all of them that is

864
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,940
epoch time it's never logged off ever

865
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:46,830
which is weird because a lot of epoch

866
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,310
time and memory on Windows is January

867
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:53,639
1st 1601 I don't know why this is almost

868
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:55,350
a day earlier but whatever it's Active

869
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,720
Directory and I know that this January

870
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,600
1st 1601 is generally agreed upon as

871
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,280
beginning of the Gregorian calendar but

872
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,260
that's a whole nother conversation so

873
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,300
it's pretty easy to identify these so if

874
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,070
you're with javelin you probably need to

875
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,969
use some machine learning to randomize

876
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,770
those last logoff dates

877
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:14,239
yeah we use artificial intelligence to

878
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,550
find out what time it is and then we

879
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:19,489
walk it off

880
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:22,250
that'll help so how do you do that for

881
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:23,629
free sorry I hate that like I said I

882
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,550
love javelin they were bought out by

883
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:27,380
Symantec that's great and now I'm like

884
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:31,040
here's how you don't have to pay for it

885
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,810
which seems wrong but one of the things

886
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,639
you can do is you should you should

887
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,460
create you should do this anyway just go

888
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,879
into your environment and create honey

889
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:43,840
users in Active Directory now in my

890
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:47,840
example actually named it admin ADM

891
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:50,720
administrator and don't worry at all

892
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,630
about being too obvious please because

893
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,459
as pen testing company everyone names

894
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,620
their administrator accounts the most

895
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,840
obvious things in the world like well

896
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,190
this is the SCADA admin account you know

897
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,970
it's the SCADA admin account because

898
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:07,190
it's named SCADA admin or the domain

899
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:09,709
administrator what should we call it

900
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:11,420
domain admin so I'm good yeah domain

901
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,670
admin sounds like a good idea let's do

902
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,260
that so be obvious the attackers are

903
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,630
absolutely going to go after it

904
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:21,140
um this is the important part though

905
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:24,170
this is really important you need to set

906
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,240
its logon hours - none of them like you

907
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,610
can't log in ever with this account and

908
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,089
I told my class some things that I did

909
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:34,340
years ago when I was younger one of the

910
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:37,430
administrators that I worked with he was

911
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:40,760
kind of a jerk so I went into the

912
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:43,669
profile and I said his log off hours to

913
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,500
be a smiley face on this grid so he'd be

914
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,880
working and then all the sudden the

915
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,350
computer wouldn't work he's like what

916
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,570
the hell happened an hour later would

917
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:53,150
come back there just be like right eye

918
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:55,400
right eye he's like what do you mean oh

919
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,070
you'll figure it out but it was a full

920
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,410
smiley face there the other reason why

921
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,920
this is important is it was earlier this

922
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,930
year or it was actually last year

923
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,400
Derek banks called me up and I don't

924
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:10,279
think Derek's here at this conference

925
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:14,090
this week I wish he was but Derek goes

926
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:17,690
he John I'm like yeah I think I found a

927
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:19,940
honeypot account I'm like why well it's

928
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,680
a domain admin and it has a password it

929
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,099
was something like password one two

930
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,910
three four I think it's a honey

931
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:29,640
like well is it really a demean admin

932
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:32,019
he goes yes look well then use that

933
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,058
that's not a honeypot that's a

934
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:35,439
vulnerability at that point and I think

935
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:36,579
we actually did talk to them and they

936
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:43,949
were like what you found our honeypot

937
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:48,430
accounts like okay we need to talk

938
00:36:43,949 --> 00:36:50,440
that's not that's not what I said in the

939
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,029
webcast but the attacker won't

940
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,650
necessarily go after these accounts

941
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:55,420
directly usually what they'll do is

942
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,910
they'll just do a password spray using a

943
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,650
tool like domain password spray and they

944
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:03,459
will pull all the user accounts and use

945
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:05,259
a password of summer 2019 against every

946
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:07,058
single account and it's indiscriminate

947
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:08,949
so if you have these accounts sprinkled

948
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:10,599
in your environment you're gonna be able

949
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:12,819
to trip some alerts so you're gonna be

950
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:14,589
able to set this up set up a similar

951
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:16,390
that if anybody ever tries to login with

952
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:18,578
this account you can shut it down or

953
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:21,190
better yet just shut the entire

954
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:23,049
workstation down and this is relatively

955
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,369
low impact in your organization if

956
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:26,890
anybody interacts with this count at all

957
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:29,650
and they need to be treated as a hostile

958
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,699
actor in the environment and also this

959
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,249
goes back to if you're gonna use

960
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:34,690
deception technologies I have people

961
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:36,308
that ask me they're like well we're

962
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,569
gonna set up a honeypot on the internet

963
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:39,269
on a network connection that has nothing

964
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:41,920
to do with our network connection that's

965
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:44,769
not a honeypot for your environment

966
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,880
that's a research project for you you

967
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:47,799
want to put honeynet

968
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,829
in deception and attributional

969
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:54,038
technologies in the pathways that an

970
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:55,599
attacker will actually use so this is

971
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,630
absolutely in the pathway that an

972
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,849
attacker would actually use it trying to

973
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:02,709
clone your website on the outside of

974
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:05,529
your environment is in the pathway in

975
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:06,940
which an attacker will actually use so

976
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:09,339
when you're hunting you're always

977
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,499
setting up the the stand and everything

978
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:14,078
in the paths that what you're hunting

979
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:15,819
will take thing is no different when

980
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,839
you're dealing with cyber deception and

981
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:21,759
attributional technologies as well

982
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:24,069
Kerberos ting we had a customer that was

983
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:26,859
running some tools they put in a bunch

984
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:28,269
of fake service accounts and as soon as

985
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:30,038
those service accounts attempted to be

986
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:32,410
interacted with it automatically

987
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:34,049
generated an alert and even after all

988
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:37,149
these years of me talking about cyber

989
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:37,960
like cyber deception and attributional

990
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,360
technologies

991
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,370
it's so funny to me how my testers try

992
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,660
to play it off like it ain't no big deal

993
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,549
if they get busted by one of these

994
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,799
things like yeah well I

995
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:50,470
yeah they detected my kerberos ting

996
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:55,090
attack but it didn't really matter I got

997
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:59,740
to me an admin it's okay I'm good no I'm

998
00:38:55,090 --> 00:39:02,290
fine it's okay no it's fine it's good

999
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,720
I'm like this is a good thing though if

1000
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:06,400
we actually get caught that's not

1001
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,290
ultimately what we're looking for and I

1002
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,270
love adding this to report effective use

1003
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:12,640
of traps multiple hosts in the domain

1004
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,950
were installed as traps this is actually

1005
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,960
a customer that was running canary from

1006
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,399
thinkest all over their environment

1007
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,780
activities conducted by BHS reveals that

1008
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,780
these traps were vulnerable to multiple

1009
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:24,370
insecurities and made tempting targets

1010
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,260
in the interaction with these hosts

1011
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,390
triggered alerts and the customer and

1012
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,340
these to the customer and these were

1013
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:32,770
reported to be H is during the test and

1014
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:35,050
and I might have to change this I don't

1015
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,300
know which one of you added this in well

1016
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,280
these should not be relied on as the

1017
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,480
sole amount of security that you provide

1018
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,730
an added layer of defense and they

1019
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,830
absolutely do if they're put in the

1020
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,180
proper location and it's the right area

1021
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,670
that an attacker is going to go through

1022
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,950
this is going to create a much more

1023
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,690
difficult environment to break into the

1024
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,040
other thing I love hearing from pen

1025
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,110
testers like well like totally be able

1026
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,000
to find those honey pots funny thing

1027
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,860
about finding honey pots is if you find

1028
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,330
a honey pot you have to interact with

1029
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,730
the honey pot if the interaction of the

1030
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:05,980
honey pot goes down the the defenders

1031
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:08,200
know you're there and that's what we're

1032
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,350
after and that works really really well

1033
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,430
whenever we actually see it deployed in

1034
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:14,740
organizations I always keep that in mind

1035
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,600
it's not hard to do and if you're using

1036
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,850
something like Symetra or think as

1037
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,220
canary one of the nice things is they

1038
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,480
actually maintain those honey pots for

1039
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,589
you keep them up-to-date if there's any

1040
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,470
vulnerabilities it doesn't introduce

1041
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,580
them into your environment just great a

1042
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:31,299
honey badger update this is the new

1043
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:33,220
stuff that we're releasing so we had an

1044
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,890
intern working on this eventually it'll

1045
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:37,839
get merged into the main honey badger

1046
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,390
with Tim tomes but right now my intern

1047
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,680
and Tim tomes are kind of fighting with

1048
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,779
each other and as near as I can tell

1049
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,430
they're both jackasses and I don't want

1050
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,750
to take a side in that it's probably a

1051
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,819
little bit more than you guys want to

1052
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,740
deal with but whenever I hear them talk

1053
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,680
at each other I swear to god it's right

1054
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:55,240
on the level of

1055
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,230
versus spaces and that just rhymes me

1056
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,029
but this works and I'm gonna give you

1057
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,700
the link where the functional version of

1058
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:04,460
honey badger is right now but this is

1059
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,348
just VB that you can convert into an

1060
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:09,079
executable relatively easy to tie into

1061
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:11,720
what I mentioned earlier you can compile

1062
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:14,809
it with mono and then run it and it's

1063
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,669
going to work and this is actually far

1064
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:19,940
more accurate geolocation in this

1065
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:21,260
situation it was 777 meters as far as

1066
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,020
the accuracy and if it's in an

1067
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,550
executable or it's in a macro it's super

1068
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,530
simple to take that executable and

1069
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:30,230
invoke it or like kind of merge it with

1070
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:32,000
other executables or it's super easy

1071
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,740
with the macro to actually put it into

1072
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,119
an Excel spreadsheet don't ever use Word

1073
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,759
documents I don't want to get into that

1074
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,470
now Word documents don't know don't work

1075
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,240
real well because even my late

1076
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,859
grandmother towards the end she was like

1077
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,868
yeah I'm not gonna open this Word

1078
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:48,680
document like why grandma it has a macro

1079
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:50,690
I'm like that's off and hackers know

1080
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:53,149
that for sure so use an Excel

1081
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:54,619
spreadsheet or put it into an executable

1082
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,720
and it'll work really really well for

1083
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:57,980
you and here's where you can get it I'll

1084
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,180
leave it up for a couple of seconds so

1085
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:04,010
you guys can take pictures of it with

1086
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:05,690
your phone so go ahead and do that but

1087
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:09,410
this is the version of honey badger that

1088
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:11,030
has it you will need a Google API key to

1089
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,500
actually utilize it properly so you

1090
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,369
won't need that because Google's getting

1091
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,339
a little more a little bit more

1092
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:19,099
stringent on API keys these days so you

1093
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:22,220
can download it alright oops I don't

1094
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:24,109
want to get to that yet so years ago my

1095
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,040
first derbycon or second or third I

1096
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:26,450
can't remember which I was giving a

1097
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,849
presentation on cyber deception because

1098
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:31,368
that's my broken record thing and I

1099
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:33,710
talked about using cyber deception at a

1100
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:36,559
bank in Germany and I didn't tell the

1101
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,299
story at the time but I wanted to now so

1102
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:42,440
years ago there was a large Bank that

1103
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:44,059
wanted us to go over to Germany for pen

1104
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,530
test engagements and a couple of other

1105
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:48,040
things cyber deception was part of it

1106
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:51,230
and they wanted me to go out over

1107
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:52,609
Thanksgiving which was tough I didn't

1108
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,559
want to go out over Thanksgiving so I

1109
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:56,690
sent them a proposal that was two times

1110
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,089
higher than our normal rate just kind of

1111
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:01,160
our go away rate and they signed it

1112
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:02,509
which is difficult because it was over

1113
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,549
Thanksgiving and I had to go down and

1114
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,210
tell my wife that we just signed this

1115
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,530
contract

1116
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:11,830
got sweetened even more because they

1117
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:11,830
said so this this rate is euros right

1118
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,990
yes so I go downstairs and I talked to

1119
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:22,850
my wife

1120
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:26,180
and she goes you signed what a contract

1121
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:30,440
over Thanksgiving and I'm like yeah I'm

1122
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:31,759
gonna be in Germany and she goes this is

1123
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,440
unacceptable I can't believe you did

1124
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,880
this is family time you're traveling all

1125
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,050
the time you're teaching all the time

1126
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,180
and now you're leaving us for

1127
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,500
Thanksgiving all this is justified right

1128
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,240
like I'm not trying to make my wife

1129
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,980
sound like she's a harpy that's

1130
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,080
completely what I was expecting going

1131
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,970
downstairs and she's kind of yelling at

1132
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:55,210
me and I set the contract down with the

1133
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:57,410
dollar amount and she's like blah and

1134
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:01,850
I'm like what are you doing she goes I'm

1135
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:03,529
going to pack so we go to Germany and

1136
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,120
the beautiful thing about this

1137
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,710
particular trip has my wife set up

1138
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,690
everything she set up the flight she set

1139
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:12,170
up the hotel the customer told us to

1140
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:14,240
stay at the specific hotel and it was

1141
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,890
really expensive and she's like that's

1142
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,799
too expensive so she found a cheaper

1143
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:20,839
hotel next to the train station in this

1144
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,190
town which some of you that live in

1145
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:26,000
Europe you already know where this is

1146
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:28,010
going so we get off the train we're

1147
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,580
walking down the street and I'm using

1148
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,710
GPS ok now turn right I look down the

1149
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:37,520
street and it's nothing but pink and red

1150
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:39,160
lights and she's my wife's like and this

1151
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,670
is a really great hotel that caters to

1152
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:46,330
Americans and I'm like totally that's

1153
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:51,470
going through my head is in the Navy

1154
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:54,770
this hotel cater to you in the Navy we

1155
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:58,040
know what she'll do so we walk down this

1156
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:59,660
street and it we go up to this

1157
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,759
it's Haute this hotel was actually a

1158
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,890
no-tell because the H sign was burnt out

1159
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,330
there's one of those classy places that

1160
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:07,040
had a gate in front of it that you had

1161
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:11,299
to buzz in - so we're buzzing the gate

1162
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,890
and the lady is like what do I so she

1163
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,750
lets us in we get up there we get into

1164
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:17,960
the lobby and she looks at us she goes

1165
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:21,599

1167
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:28,290
to put new carpet in your bedroom and

1168
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,910
her husband just like pops out of the

1169
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:31,470
back with his roll of carpet and he's

1170
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,808
like I'll be right back and he goes

1171
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,189
upstairs and the lady was really nice

1172
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:37,890
she made us dinner and she's like we

1173
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:40,559
almost never get you know like children

1174
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,970
here I'm like clearly you don't cuz for

1175
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,650
reference this is the place when you're

1176
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:46,259
walking down the street with your family

1177
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,880
I'm once again caters to Americans um

1178

1179
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:56,520
looking for a good time my kids would be

1180
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:58,770
like so the guy goes upstairs and he

1181
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,420
puts in the the carpet and then he's

1182
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,130
like okay time for bed and our rooms

1183
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,579
were two rooms are joined together and

1184
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:08,400
we get snuggled in bed and we're laying

1185
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,900
there and I'm almost in tears because

1186
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,700
we're in the red-light district and I'm

1187
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,720
like what the hell are we gonna do and

1188
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,240
the other thing that's going through my

1189
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,149
head is thank God my wife booked this

1190
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,459
hotel and not me as if I would have done

1191
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:23,910
it I would be in big trouble so all of a

1192
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:28,140
sudden the the male owner of the hotel

1193
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:30,299
like throws the door open comes up next

1194
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:35,670
to me and goes don't turn on the

1195
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:37,680
television and then proceeds to unplug

1196
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,540
the televisions in both our rooms which

1197
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,990
my kids see so naturally they're like

1198
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:46,079
what's on TV dad what's on TV

1199
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:47,910
and this was like a television that

1200
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,309
every single channel had a different

1201
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,890
style of porn it was amazing it was

1202
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:54,950
years before its time but we ran this

1203
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:59,720
technology at this particular customer

1204
00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:03,569
for about a week and we had well over

1205
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,919
250 people that ran the attributional

1206
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:07,319
technology so if you're ever wondering

1207
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,589
well anyone well an attacker run this

1208
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:12,690
the answer is yes we then took all of

1209
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:14,369
these IP addresses in the ASNs

1210
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,230
associated with these IP addresses and

1211
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:17,940
we saw if there were any outbound

1212
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:19,319
connections to these network ranges and

1213
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,849
we have found four systems in their

1214
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:26,460
environment that were compromised

1215
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:29,130
that's threat intelligence folks we can

1216
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,780
change the way we look at cyber threat

1217
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,350
intelligence and so far as what we are

1218
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,810
actually

1219
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:35,460
looking for we use it to learn about

1220
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:37,560
hackers and improve our defense or

1221
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,000
defenses and we can do better with

1222
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,730
deception technology now I want to be

1223
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,740
clear cyber threat intelligence is great

1224
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,330
when you're researching an IP address or

1225
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,339
something it's amazing for those

1226
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:49,319
activities but if you're like we're

1227
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,390
gonna instrument this and stop attackers

1228
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,830
from breaking into our environments more

1229
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,480
than likely it's not going to work as

1230
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:56,250
well as you think because the attackers

1231
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,560
aren't using the exact same techniques

1232
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:02,580
they did when mandiant recorded

1233
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:08,279
everything that they did ok um I want to

1234
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:12,480
say thanks these two weeks suck this is

1235

not here

1253
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:21,009
read Dave's article about it don't be

mad at Dave and the derbycon stuff they

1255
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:26,799
gave us an amazing gift and we owe them

1256
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:28,180
our things so that's it for my time I

1257
