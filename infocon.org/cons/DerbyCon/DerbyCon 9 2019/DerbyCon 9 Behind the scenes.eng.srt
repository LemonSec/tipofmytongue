13
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:24,170

15
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,299

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,320

17
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:33,470

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,070
containers open to get pachinko balls

30
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,649
and then you can play them in our

31
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,209
fabulous lineup of pachinko machines and

32
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,440
to encourage try to increase your

33
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:29,720

winnings are in the bottom tray and yeah

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,720
all controls are variable power since

39
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,548
this kind of vertical ping ball I heard

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,739
was excuses people could gamble but

41
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:50,950
still make it sort of a game of a sport

42
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:53,140
well of course in Japan

43
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,589
pachinko parlor operators don't have any

44
00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,790
prizes but usually within a right next

45
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:03,010
door is a place you can trade winnings

46
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:08,290
for prizes is the way that it usually

47
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:13,769
