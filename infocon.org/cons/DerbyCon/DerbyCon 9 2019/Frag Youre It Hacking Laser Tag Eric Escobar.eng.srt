1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,670
sorry my voice sounds like a frog I've

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,360
been talking a lot so hey my name is

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,440
Eric Escobar I'm a pen tester full time

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,870
and hacker of laser tag in my off time

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,580
this is not going to be a super serious

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,619
security talk like some of the stuff

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,139
I've given before because sometimes

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,509
security stuff is just for fun and

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,109
there's no big practical use no zero

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,369
days not not anything crazy and so I

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,619
just want to throw that out there that

12
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,239
this isn't like oh you can you know

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,980
compromise the endpoint systems of all

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,559
these laser tag systems this is a

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,000
weakness and how they're deployed and

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,050
hopefully at the end of the day if you

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,879
guys want to build your own that's

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,379
that's the takeaway here of how to do it

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,089
and in a little bit of why so first and

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,968
foremost I did not build this to be a

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,430
troll to young kids and my cousins who I

22
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,760
played laser tag with I built this

23
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:00,059
because there is a single laser tag

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,489
facility in my town and there's a whole

25
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,619
league associated with it and there are

26
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,990
people that come and play multiple times

27
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,270
a week and they absolutely wreck people

28
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,610
that don't come you know multiple

29
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,399
multiple times a week and make matters

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,140
worse they've like call it do defied it

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,610
what I mean to say by that is the more

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,900
you come the better weapons you get the

33
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,390
better armor you get all the better

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,790
things you get you get to level up so

35
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,740
really when you you know when you're

36
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,540
doing laser tag when you're fighting

37
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,939
against these guys they're trying to own

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,610
you so that they can level up and gain

39
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,889
experience so a roomful of little kids

40
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,450
that's absolutely what they want to take

41
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,829
out so they get all the experience so

42
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,650
they can level up so they can be on the

43
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,389
leaderboard so it takes away from the

44
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,820
fun of it because you have somebody

45
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,530
who's like 30 years old going in there

46
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,429
and taking a whole bunch of junior

47
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:54,090
highers like at a youth group so so this

48
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,490
is to combat those people

49
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,590
so first I'm gonna talk to the basics of

50
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,899
how laser tag works it's basically a

51
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,840
less than fancy TV remote a TV remote

52
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,310
remembers a lot of different codes you

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,729
know you have your up down power all

54
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,860
that stuff a laser tag gun all it all it

55
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,209
knows is just one single code and that

56
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,090
is you know the trigger when you pull

57
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:18,610
the trigger a single round going out all

58
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:22,269
infrared is is just a little LED light

59
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,190
that your eyes can't pick up and really

60
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:26,050
the signal here it's just a single shot

61
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,670
you know from your guns every time you

62
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,069
pull the trigger it sends a pulse a

63
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,780
light out it's not very sophisticated at

64
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:34,600
all and that's inherently where the

65
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,040
weakness lies so you probably when you

66
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,799
look at the front of your le or the

67
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,510
front of your you know remote you know

68
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:42,040
you notice that hey you don't see

69
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,829
anything there's just a little LED bulb

70
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,510
there well laser tag taggers when you go

71
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,160
somewhere you'll notice that when you

72
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,140
pull the trigger you actually see a

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,910
flash on the wall that flash on the wall

74
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,589
is completely theatrics it doesn't do

75
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,750
anything it doesn't mean anything it's

76
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,489
just to give somebody the impression

77
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,410
that hey when you pull the trigger light

78
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:00,579
and that is the pulse going out there so

79
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,109
what you actually see when you pull the

80
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:04,750
trigger isn't actually anything at all

81
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:06,400
that's visible light infrared which is

82
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,980
what actually is transmitting the signal

83
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,540
that is in the wavelength that you can't

84
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,890
see and if you've ever seen like a

85
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,230
security camera or something how they

86
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,029
kind of glow red that's that's infrared

87
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,130
light so what's nice is that if you have

88
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,900
a older phone camera that doesn't have

89
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,489
an infrared filter or a security camera

90
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,709
that has like a night vision mode on it

91
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,440
you can use that to at least see the

92
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,070
signals you know kind of debug stuff and

93
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,769
go from there

94
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,690
and so this is just a dumb example I

95
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:32,799
pulled off of Google that's what it

96
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,640
looks like if you're looking through

97
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,060
this from like a night-vision camera

98
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,649
from you know anything that can that

99
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,780
doesn't have an infrared filter on it

100
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,920
and it's a good way to troubleshoot and

101
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,230
it's also a good way to pick up any

102
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,290
hidden cameras just as a side note if

103
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,358
you're anywhere so kind of going forward

104
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,940
about you know this is what a similar

105
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:53,590
laser tag setup looks like you know you

106
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,450
see all the blinking lights on the front

107
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,950
in actuality those blinking lights are

108
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,578
only to indicate that there's a target

109
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,230
they're not in any way shape or form

110
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:04,360
receiving anything in between the little

111
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,760
blinky lights is actually the infrared

112
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,700
receiver and if you look really

113
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,079
at like a little clear bulb that's on

114
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,238
the front of these like targets or

115
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,520
jackets or whatever all they are just

116
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,910
normal infrared receivers like you find

117
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,019
in you know your TV's in you know your

118
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,850
you know pretty much any electronic that

119
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,980
uses a remote they all have the same

120
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,660
receiver and they're you know you can

121
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,580
buy about a hundred of them off eBay for

122
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,900
about five dollars so everything is

123
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,030
incredibly cheap because it's so

124
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,830
ubiquitous and it's in every device so

125
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,450
of course an engineer for this kind of

126
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,900
stuff is gonna is gonna take his time

127
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,400
you know and and get something cheap

128
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,289
because why not you know they're not

129
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,450
gonna reinvent a protocol because who's

130
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,650
actually gonna hack this I mean that at

131
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,450
the end of the day it takes somebody

132
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:52,090
pretty desperate to win a laser tag to

133
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:53,560
do this see I I came in like full

134
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,840
disclosure I came to the laser tag and I

135
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,490
had absolutely no level ups no power ups

136
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,440
and and so they were mopping the floor

137
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,960
with us and if you notice from the

138
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,820
tagger on the left there's there's two

139
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,130
little beams coming out of it that red

140
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,570
beam that is the action that's just like

141
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,030
normal light that you can see in the

142
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,070
purple one the narrow or one that is

143
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,659
just the infrared signal that is just a

144
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:18,640
little infrared LED and cool did bring

145
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,260
that in there so again these are these

146
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,640
are less than a dime a dozen

147
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:27,159
you know the both the infrared LEDs and

148
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,110
the receivers this is all that powers a

149
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,820
full entire game of laser tag this is

150
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,200
what is doing the transmitting and

151
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,760
receiving so if you've ever played laser

152
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,469
tagging up like a headband and you have

153
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,430
like the vest and all that stuff you

154
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,770
just have a bunch of the little

155
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,990
receivers on you and then the infrared

156
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,680
LED is basically just focused into like

157
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:46,300
you know like less than a like a pretty

158
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,320
much like a tight flashlight beam and so

159
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,880
that's what you're shooting when you're

160
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,340
shooting out of your laser tag even

161
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,050
though your eyes don't pick it up and

162
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,880
all of the scoring all of those

163
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,650
mechanisms and you know how it's

164
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,530
determined whether or not you're tagged

165
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,210
in tagged out if you get upgrades all of

166
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,210
that is controlled by a back-end server

167
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,460
so when when I shoot you know my gun and

168
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,900
it gets hit by a tiger that tiger then

169
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,870
communicates in the backend system

170
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,638
saying hey this ID actually you know

171
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,630
tagged to me what does that mean does

172
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,180
that mean it's gonna take away more

173
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,800
health does that mean this users out of

174
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,690
you know out of play

175
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,460
or if there's a healing frequency it

176
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,590
might mean that hey you get to respawn

177
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,859
you get to come back in so the end of

178
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:29,258
the day all that the infrared doing is

179
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,720
doing transmitting it is just saying hey

180
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,849
this user tagged this user now and the

181
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,509
back end is taken care of by gameplay

182
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:38,979
and everything else along those lines

183
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,300
now let's talk about exploiting this

184
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:43,150
weakness so you guys can probably

185
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,610
identify it at this point but infrared

186
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,198
is one way you know it's just you're

187
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,940
literally pressing the button and you

188
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,680
know the volume up or the power off is

189
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,960
gonna go off on your TV it's one way

190
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,460
there's no you know response back

191
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,190
there's no authentication there's none

192
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,900
of that nonsense every time every time

193
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:02,319
you shoot the gun the same code is

194
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,179
replayed out of that laser tag gun it's

195
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,030
not sophisticated at all it's just a

196
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,050
normal run-of-the-mill replay attack you

197
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,049
know that you see in a lot of other

198
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,659
wireless technology of just hey you know

199
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,520
why why design this with a ton of

200
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:18,340
security at the end of the day all this

201
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,580
is just a game you know no one's no

202
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:24,369
one's gonna look at this an attack it or

203
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,770
design a device to exploit the weakness

204
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,870
of it so this was my inspiration

205
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,448
this is posted about in 2014 on

206
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,159
Instructables way back in the day you

207
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,500
can see this person made a bomb looking

208
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:37,210
thing out of a 9-volt battery and

209
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,039
basically what this does is is similar

210
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:41,138
to what I created in that it has a

211
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,750
receiver and then it has a single LED

212
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,479
that retransmits that signal over and

213
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,340
over and over and over and over okay

214
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,199
that's really nice looks like a bomb but

215
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,349
I wanted something that had a better UI

216
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:56,650
and I wanted to cause pure chaos pure

217
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:59,650
havoc and I just wanted constant

218
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,859
firepower always from every direction so

219
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:05,258
let's let's take this and take it take

220
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,750
ticket to the extreme so I want multiple

221
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:09,940
LEDs I don't I don't want any of this

222
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,979
you know you know I don't want to like

223
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,069
oh look I'm shooting downrange I want it

224
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:17,380
to be a claymore that goes off every

225
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:19,240
every second you know I I don't want

226
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,250
this to be to be some run-of-the-mill

227
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,630
like oh look he has two guns no it's

228
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,080
like he has a gun a nuclear bomb

229
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,159
[Applause]

230
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,890
thank you I'm glad you guys appreciate

231
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,760
this he's telling my wife about it and

232
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:38,470
she's like well it's a lot of work

233
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:41,090
you're putting into this exactly right

234
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,919
the next thing that I wanted is I wanted

235
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,080
this thing to be high power when I say

236
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,120
high power you notice little blinky LEDs

237
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,490
they come in all ranges of power

238
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,040
I want it to be as absolutely powerful

239
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:56,570
as possible so I found one on Adafruit

240
00:08:52,040 --> 00:09:01,819
that allows a 1 amp pulse which which is

241
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:03,380
brights when seen from a camera you

242
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,330
could also use it to be an illuminator

243
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,740
for if you have a security camera at all

244
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,530
you can absolutely use it for that as

245
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,820
well the next thing is to is I wanted to

246
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,740
you I the one that I showed you

247
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,540
previously that was online as amazing as

248
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,250
that was it was a single you know you

249
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,170
shoot into it and then it just replace

250
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,970
over and over and over I'm one of the UI

251
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,589
so that I could do you know data

252
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,380
analysis look at the signals that we're

253
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,700
coming in and be able to do it from my

254
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,380
phone because I didn't want any of this

255
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,630
nonsense I'm trying to like plug in

256
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,160
buttons or wires or you know look like I

257
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,870
have a bomb and a laser tag thing I just

258
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,959
wanted to you know touch my phone and

259
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,160
say yep I want constant firepower and

260
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,410
the other thing that I wanted to also

261
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,819
want to data logging because you know

262
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,490
once you've cloned a signal if it's like

263
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,590
say a respawn signal that never changes

264
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,330
so why not just keep that with you just

265
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,380
so you can always have it you know

266
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,240
whenever you go somewhere

267
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,680
Plus this way to you can build profiles

268
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,230
for all the different laser tech

269
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,109
facilities that you visit really this

270
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,600
like really this is just absolutely

271
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,300
taking to the extreme is it necessary

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,960
100% not this entire talk is completely

273
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,790
unnecessary I just think it's really fun

274
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,070
next I want to say thank you to this

275
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,569
Rockstar so I'm a pen tester my

276
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,570
background is in civil engineering which

277
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,710
totally correlates and I reached out in

278
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,360
slack one day I was like does anybody

279
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,800
know an electrical engineer because I'm

280
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,300
probably gonna serve something on fire

281
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,729
because it wouldn't be the first time

282
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,839
and so when my co-workers reached out

283
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,310
he's like dude I'm an electrical

284
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,529
engineer like I talked to this guy

285
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,489
multiple times a day and he's like you

286
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,380
didn't know that I was an electrical

287
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,060
engineer so I said hey for your help I'm

288
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,160
gonna give you a nice shout-out in this

289
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:38,569
talk so this is his rock star in a

290
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,010
Corvette LinkedIn profile picture sorry

291
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,180
Michael out his name is Michael Howard -

292
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,750
I didn't put that in there but he

293
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,339
deserves a recognition so ok let's talk

294
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,680
about some of the design considerations

295
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,720
I wanted to be concealable I wanted it

296
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,219
to be obviously easy to use because

297
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,690
maybe I'm not gonna go play laser tag

298
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,730
but I want to hand it off to one of my

299
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,990
younger cousins and say hey you know

300
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,050
you're welcome for a complete and utter

301
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,330
domination I wanted to have again the

302
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,130
ultra white LEDs and I also wanted a

303
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,110
decent power management I didn't want

304
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,700
you know cables running everywhere and

305
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,920
you don't have to put stuff in my pocket

306
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,209
so I needed to figure all that out and

307
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,500
so it's the classic one of these things

308
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:15,949
I look up that shouldn't be that hard to

309
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,140
do you know and then a week later you're

310
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:22,130
like wow I am getting way too deep into

311
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,240
this so going forward I decide to base

312
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,740
everything off of a Raspberry Pi

313
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,750
raspberry PI's run pretty much

314
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,880
everything in my house from sprinklers

315
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,529
to my chicken coop to my security system

316
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,189
so I figured hey I have a bunch of these

317
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,920
lying around

318
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,589
why wouldn't I plus it has its super

319
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,349
small it's really power efficient has

320
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:41,120
Wi-Fi already built-in onboard and then

321
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,339
it can host all the webserver e things

322
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,020
and all of the you know file storage and

323
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:47,390
all that you could have done it with an

324
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:51,709
Arduino but I find that it's just easier

325
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:54,350
to boot up a PI and go from there next

326
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:56,449
let's talk about the infrared LEDs so

327
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,930
like I was saying I picked these up on

328
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,779
on Adafruit they have one ant pulses you

329
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:05,120
cannot just use that as an illuminator

330
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:08,089
at 1 amp consistently when they say

331
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,290
pulse they mean pulse I found that out

332
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,170
the hard way

333
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,219
these also produce a 20 degree count so

334
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,329
you can think of it kind of like a

335
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,820
flashlight you know it's a cone that

336
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:17,420
goes out at 20 degrees so that was

337
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,120
really important

338
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,479
for you know the over Lappe overlapping

339
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:27,200
chaos that was to ensue so this is kind

340
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:30,440
of the spray pattern I decided that I

341
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,970
wanted at least a 70 70 degree kill

342
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,670
radius that was pretty sufficient that

343
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,810
if I were if I were standing up here it

344
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:40,430
would take you all out you would all be

345
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:42,109
gone so I decided you know I'm gonna

346
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,910
have a little bit of overlap so at 5

347
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,180
degree overlap and then there 15 degrees

348
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:49,030
separated since there's 20 degree cone

349
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:52,040
so 70 degrees in total and again

350
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:53,439
completely and utterly unnecessary and

351
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,030
so if you were to look at this in a

352
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,980
three-dimensional way it's 70 degrees

353
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:00,920
this way with the 20 degree cone that

354
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,360
way I might even like future builds I

355
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,640
might even have a second layer that do

356
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,280
like a 10 degree or 20 degree tilts up

357
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,020
because one of the laser tag places as

358
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,699
actually two-story and I would really

359
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:16,010
like to take out both top and bottom

360
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:18,620
without having to go again

361
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,750
again totally unnecessary I'm gonna keep

362
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,580
reiterating this that this is not

363
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,580
important and it is not necessary in any

364
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,440
way shape or form and so you know I I

365
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,450
started having fun with some hot glue

366
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,740
and realized you know what I am NOT

367
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,780
gonna try and cram this in the tiny

368
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,100
little box instead I'm gonna 3d print my

369
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,160
own and this is where you start going

370
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,490
down the technical rabbit hole so you

371
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,810
can see from this I am able to space it

372
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,770
out at perfectly 15 degrees and again

373
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,599
totally unnecessary

374
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,250
I just keep reiterating that and this

375
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,770
this is this is how it generated that

376
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,810
cone because in the 3d software you can

377
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,689
like perfectly rotate things and before

378
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:58,310
this was like me drilling into it and

379
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,740
you know trying to hot glue it in there

380
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,329
and it was it was just a pain and a mess

381
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,980
and I was like man if I ever talk about

382
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,480
this this is gonna look embarrassing to

383
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,040
be like and look at my hot glue skills

384
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:12,590
you know with some like popsicle sticks

385
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,510
arts and crafts yeah exactly so this is

386
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,460
you know again you're like I'm just

387
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,710
gonna like 3d print a box how hard could

388
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,950
it be and then again you spend three

389
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,330
hours modeling something in Tinkercad

390
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,890
you know to get all the you know because

391
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,040
at this point you have all of your

392
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,720
design you want to

393
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,279
like mount everything perfectly so

394
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,290
nothing rattles around so there's no

395
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,839
Genki 'no sin there and then you realize

396
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,759
like all i need to top to this and that

397
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,430
top took way longer to design that it

398
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,019
should have because man 3d printing so

399
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,180
there's another shot of it you can see

400
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,459
that everything you know I have I have

401
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,380
my little calipers to do to go down to

402
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,569
like the millimeter to make sure all the

403
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,880
holes in the right place to get a hole

404
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:53,130
for the receiver to get a hole for the

405
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,160
you know you can see in the back to get

406
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,689
power into it it's just again totally

407
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,930
unnecessary but took a lot more work

408
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:03,690
than I thought it was going to all right

409
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,339
so power management so I got again

410
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,639
Adafruit I should have just asked them

411
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:10,319
the sponsor this but really this thing

412
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,880
is great it basically just works exactly

413
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:13,349
how your phone works when you plug it

414
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,939
into the wall it charges and when you

415
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,319
unplug it from the wall it doesn't turn

416
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,930
off it just goes off of it it's

417
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:20,490
basically like a UPS I ran it off of a

418
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,769
215 million power battery

419
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,940
it's totally sufficient for 30 minutes

420
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:25,949
of juice you can probably get more out

421
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,139
of it but also those batteries are super

422
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:29,758
cheap so you can absolutely you know

423
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:34,560
pick up a bunch of them if you want to

424
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:36,329
have extended playtime next was powering

425
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,800
the LEDs again it's like oh man like I

426
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:39,479
don't really know how all of this

427
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,579
electronic stuff works I know how the

428
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,889
the software part of it works and the

429
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:47,310
theoretical part of it but the IR LEDs

430
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:49,139
take 1.2 volts not 3.3 and my electrical

431
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,000
engineering buddy it was like oh man you

432
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,000
don't like you're gonna blow all of

433
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,940
those up which I did blow up a couple so

434
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,459
what I did is I connected directly or I

435
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,430
got a buck converter to step it down

436
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,260
from 3 volts to 1.2 volts to make it

437
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,609
more efficient that way didn't have to

438
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,199
had just have a resistor in there and

439
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,089
lose power and generate a bunch of heat

440
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,740
and all that nonsense I didn't really

441
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:14,060
understand this part but he said trust

442
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,060
me bro so I did

443
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:19,199
so the way that you connect to it the

444
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,639
way that you control this is all the

445
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,008
clans run in the background so if your

446
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,079
phone disconnects from from the hotspot

447
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:26,670
or the access point that is onboard the

448
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,040
PI it doesn't matter you'll still keep

449
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,300
firing your heart's content and again

450
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,740
it's all controlled on my phone that was

451
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,779
one of the big use cases that I wanted

452
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,029
and so how does this work you can either

453
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,639
connect the PI to a hotspot in your in

454
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:40,050
your pocket you can connect it directly

455
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,839
to your phone if your phone is a hotspot

456
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,939
or you can even stand up an access point

457
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,680
using the onboard Wi-Fi on the Raspberry

458
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:48,329
Pi and connect your phone to that a ton

459
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,620
of different options I ended up just

460
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:52,920
going the hotspot route just because it

461
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,809
was easiest so this is this is a picture

462
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,729
of like the templating of it just make

463
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:59,670
sure that I had everything in there eh

464
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,499
okay and that it fit this is the sides

465
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,670
built up on it there's a little bit

466
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:04,079
tangled mess in the front but that

467
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,030
eventually got cleaned up I just don't

468
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,619
have a picture of it you can see the

469
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,990
Raspberry Pi in there you can see the

470
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:12,479
the power boost you can see the buck

471
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:15,929
converter and all the other mess of

472
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,220
wires on the GPIO pins this is it up and

473
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,140
running so what's really nice is that

474
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,640
you just plug it into USB to charge it

475
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,649
so it's just just like a phone of light

476
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,439
yep micro USB you plug it in and it

477
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:27,359
charges away and so it manages all the

478
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,640
UPS capabilities and all that stuff and

479
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,439
it auto shut down if it has low battery

480
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,500
or anything like that

481
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,960
next the software end it's PHP I've

482
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,120
never written PHP but it's like maybe

483
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,659
five lines for each page it's nothing

484
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,879
nothing crazy it's horribly insecure I'm

485
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:46,620
literally just taking input from a field

486
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,880
not sanitizing anything and running that

487
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:53,699
directly as route on this Raspberry Pi

488
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,260
I'm a pen tester so I know I know that

489
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,630
that is not good but the end of the day

490
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,149
if you want to steal like my my hex

491
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,429
encoded files for my laser tag gun

492
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:05,219
awesome you'd also have to break my like

493
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:06,899
crazy wpa2 encrypted pass phrase so I'm

494
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,309
not at all worried about it but I just

495
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:09,539
want to like stave off anybody from

496
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,789
saying like well actually that's

497
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,789
insecure I know it is I built it

498
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,179
it uses Pi GPIO DITA cailli use the GPIO

499
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,760
pins to receive and send all of the

500
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,650
information and then I found this

501
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,840
software on some random Raspberry Pi

502
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,010
form and I can't find it anywhere else I

503
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,590
look for the github page it was written

504
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,300
back in 2015 it's like 200 lines but

505
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,449
without it it would have taken me a lot

506
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,649
more work to manage this basically you

507
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,090
can find the link to it right there

508
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,309
again these slides will all be online

509
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,110
you'll see all this nonsense later but

510
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:44,639
really this is just somebody's like oh I

511
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,139
just decided to write this because I

512
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,890
wanted to have like a home theater

513
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,809
control system and so the links that he

514
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,660
has are all now dead except for this one

515
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:56,040
this page is where it has it available

516
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,380
and basically the only thing that I

517
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:02,309
changed in this code was to make it shew

518
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,770
faster that's it because going back to

519
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,910
this it was just it was just a made for

520
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,010
a home theater so like why do you need

521
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:11,070
to transmit the same code you know 20

522
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:14,190
times a second so the inner flow the

523
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,350
interface work flow or the flow of it is

524
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,480
you just name the signal and you start

525
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,730
listening and so then you shoot your gun

526
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,590
into the device and then it basically

527
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,640
writes it out to a file I could have

528
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,678
done a whole database and all that

529
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,620
nonsense but why it doesn't really

530
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,690
matter then after that you select the

531
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,879
signal that you want to transmit you hit

532
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,650
fire and then by default it will run the

533
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,200
command in the background and start

534
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,610
pulsing out at 20 times per second and

535
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,650
in most laser tag games you have

536
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,570
anywhere from three to six shots to kill

537
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,160
you so in half a second literally you've

538
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,409
taken out an entire room of people so

539
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,440
you become the juggernaut at that point

540
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:51,660
like you are unstoppable this is I've

541
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,710
never played a video inside of a

542
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,100
PowerPoint so I don't know how this is

543
00:19:52,710 --> 00:20:00,059
gonna work

544
00:19:53,100 --> 00:20:01,678
oh snap it works so yeah this is just

545
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,389
screen recording in my phone

546
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,790
you hit the record button it's gonna

547
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,980
name it ir dot txt again doesn't really

548
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:10,139
matter I shot the code into it and it

549
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,080
says cool confirmed you did it and then

550
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,730
you just select it from your file list

551
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,710
and then you hit fire and it goes 20

552
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,300
times a second if you also wanted to

553
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,540
cause havoc the other thing that you

554
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,940
could do is you could put in all the TV

555
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,299
begun signals and just basically wipe

556
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,729
out

557
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:28,349
an entire sports bar again that's like

558
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:32,879
that's like bonus feature you could add

559
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:35,458
on and I mean think what you could do

560
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:37,439
with like 70 degrees by 20 degrees at

561
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:38,940
like 20 times a second you could just

562
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,679
turn it on off on and off on off and it

563
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,549
would work for everything you could

564
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,669
cause havoc

565
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:46,139
I will let you expand upon that I'm not

566
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:50,580
gonna say that I've already loaded it I

567
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:52,049
have but it's one of those things like

568
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,458
multi-purpose you know I like multi

569
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:56,009
tools I keep one in my pocket why not

570
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:58,409
have an IR multi-tool so that's user

571
00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:01,589
interface oh just like it's just gonna

572
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:03,929
play again so how do I work out I I

573
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:05,779
ruled the entire thing nerds nerds rule

574
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,729
the world so I'm gonna now take this

575
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:11,690
basically to talk about how it actually

576
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:14,099
worked than the one time that I used it

577
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,049
so I went with my younger high school

578
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:17,070
cousin to go play laser tag and we show

579
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:19,408
up and there's probably a bunch of

580
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,879
junior highers okay great and then this

581
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:23,879
guy walks in he's like see me on the

582
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:26,070
board that's me and I was like oh cool

583
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:28,468
I've never done this I don't know how

584
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:32,849
this works at all false I knew exactly

585
00:21:28,469 --> 00:21:34,379
how yeah I'm pretty good at this I come

586
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:37,200
a couple times a week you know with my

587
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:38,939
crew and it was like oh cool all right

588
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,799
again I don't know how this works like

589
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,469
is it over there and he's like yeah like

590
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,749
let's go so then the high schooler that

591
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,700
was working the place is like Oh anybody

592
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:49,919
have a player card will get you your

593
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,749
upgrades and I asked the guys like what

594
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,459
does that mean and he's like oh well he

595
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:56,159
gets to respawn with all the guns and

596
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:57,989
armor and tools that he had last time he

597
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,369
played and I said well we've never

598
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:00,929
played here he's gonna night light us

599
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:02,639
and he's like sir it's not like that I

600
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:04,409
think oh it's absolutely like that

601
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:05,728
you're giving them a better gun and he's

602
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:08,269
gonna nya ate a bunch of junior highers

603
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:12,089
and me a thirty year old and my cousin

604
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:15,299
and so again we start playing and this

605
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:17,700
guy's like you know going crazy and it's

606
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:20,219
like what he's taking out an entire you

607
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,870
know an entire rank of children as they

608
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:25,480
run down this ramp

609
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,820
and that's where I decided to unleash

610
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,440
havoc so I cloned my gun

611
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,330
no problem save it in there start

612
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,550
replaying and all of a sudden he just

613
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,780
dies instantly it was like huh and he's

614
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,250
like whoa like where did that come from

615
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,899
there was no one around him Oh also

616
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,480
while I was doing this I was flashing

617
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,220
dead so like I couldn't even be killed

618
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,990
because I was already gone but my gun

619
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:48,400
was still active and he didn't realize

620
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:50,710
it and so I'm basically just following

621
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,510
this guy around and he's dying but he

622
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:55,650
knows that I can't be killing him

623
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,650
because I'm already dead

624
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:02,950
it was absolutely awesome and then the

625
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,390
next piece of that is like okay that got

626
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,970
boring after about five minutes I'm not

627
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,680
that big of a troll and so then what I

628
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,680
found is like paint I can just go clone

629
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,690
the the respawn frequency so then I sent

630
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,640
my little cousin you know down the main

631
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,500
path and I just kept the respond

632
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,260
frequency right on him so he never died

633
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,570
he was invincible which is pretty

634
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,220
awesome and that was essentially the

635
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,570
takeaways I was like dude I have no idea

636
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,180
this works and he's like man that was a

637
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:31,000
weird game right and I was like I was

638
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,620
like I have no idea like I don't know

639
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,780
how this works I was dead the entire

640
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,010
time he's like you didn't respawn and I

641
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,129
was like oh is that a thing

642
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:43,000
he just had no idea so at the end of the

643
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:45,660
day this is completely not important not

644
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,880
important at all it's just a lot of fun

645
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,950
and it's it's that taking it to the next

646
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,240
level even though you don't have to so

647
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,860
if you guys have questions about it you

648
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,010
