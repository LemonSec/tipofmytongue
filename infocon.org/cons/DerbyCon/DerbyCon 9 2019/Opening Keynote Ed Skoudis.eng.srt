46
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,759
talk it's kind of new and experimental I

47
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,420
just wrote this recently over the last

48
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,500
three weeks

49
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,790
whenever talk is kind of new and

50
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,540
experimental and you don't know how it's

51
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,189
gonna go

52
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,750
it could go great it could go be a

53
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:03,029
disaster I dunno how to end it now I

54
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,430
learned this last night one of the

55
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,940
things that you can do at the end of

56
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:13,030
your talk is lather yourself up

57
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:16,570
with a whole bunch of shaving cream and

58
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,540
turn your body into sculpture so if the

59
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:22,150
talk doesn't go well I brought my towel

60
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,359
and I went to CVS this morning to get

61
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,190
some Barbasol for y'all so you and I

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,420
both have a vested interest in this talk

63
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:33,160
going well alright alright so anyway

64
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,119

65
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,160
InfoSec career tips I learned from Santa

66
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,210
dr. Seuss and other friends now you can

67
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,160
see who one of those other friends is

68
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,290
right there all right I'd like to share

69
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,299
with you some of the things that my

70
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,390
friends have told me over the years that

71
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,710
have greatly helped me in my career but

72
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,690
to kind of show you how this thing is

73
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,820
gonna work I want to start out with

74
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,980
they've mentioned stories I want to

75
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,930
start out with a story who here is

76
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,989
familiar with Rudolph the red-nosed

77
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,670
reindeer kind of hope everybody is right

78
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,860
have you ever really thought about the

79
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,679
meaning of that story Rudolph the

80
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,100
red-nosed reindeer let me tell you that

81
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,470
story there was a guy a reindeer he was

82
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,430
born he was unusual

83
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:21,400
he had a nonconformity his nose it was

84
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,590
bright red it was so bright you might

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,860
even say it glows how did the world

86
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,590
react to this it was a disaster they

87
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,320
shunned him they made fun of him they

88
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,230
used to laugh and call him names

89
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,850
he was so saddened by this thing the

90
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:42,429
world rejected Rudolph was terrible so

91
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,440
he self-exile he laughed but that's not

92
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,840
the end of the story how does the story

93
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,120
end when the world figure out a way that

94
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,920
they could use his unusual

95
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,430
characteristics the way that they could

96
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,130
exploit his deformity then and only then

97
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,739
did they love him they loved him so much

98
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,230
that he'll go down in history

99
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,570
so what fundamentally is the lesson of

100
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,820
the Rudolph story they will shun you for

101
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,100
your differences they will mock you they

102
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,859
will hate you until they figure out how

103
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:15,519
they can profit from that and then and

104
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,350
only then will they love you so what do

105
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,260
you do with that this is a childhood

106
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,950
story then we tell our kids what do you

107
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,840
do with that

108
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,840
well maybe you think you do this

109
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,699
all right now

110
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,770
I hear venison is pretty tasty and that

111
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:40,180
is one option but you can't live your

112
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,000
life like that right it's dead maybe we

113
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,310
can retell the Rudolph story a different

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,870
way of looking at it so the Rudolph

115
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,410
story it's about a guy who was born

116
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,940
reindeer decent chap he's a little

117
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,130
unusual he's got his nonconformity

118
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,580
people treat him badly for it it happens

119
00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:00,310
you see it every day right but what does

120
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,219
he do how does he react to that when the

121
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,550
world needs him when the holiday season

122
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,130
is threatened to be canceled Rudolph

123
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,350
steps up and takes care of the people

124
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,870
who were mean to him as well as all of

125
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,850
his friends to right hermien and Yukon

126
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,470
kornelius and all the other ones that's

127
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,060
another way of interpreting the same

128
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,090
story Rudolph

129
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,580
helps people and tries to make the world

130
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,169
a bit better place despite the fact that

131
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,639
the world didn't treat him so well you

132
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:30,310
see what this is all about is

133
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,200
perspective perspective and what I'd

134
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,780
like to share with you is some different

135
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,430
perspectives on things that I've learned

136
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,469
from my friends over the various years

137
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,900
and I hope these perspectives will help

138
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,099
you in your career you know there's a

139
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,950
guy on my team his name is Daniel

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:47,139
pendolino and Dan said something to me a

141
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,300

holiday hack challenge and what daniel

156
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:19,210
said is one of his favorite parts about

157
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,550
holiday hack challenge is how we often

158
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,169
take a different perspective on some

159
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,030
famous characters associated with a

160
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:29,349

that was sort of 8-bit graphics and we

164
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,460
had 8-bit audio and the villain was

165
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,569

205
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,698
amazing things so that's kind of what

206

I'll do the talk so here's the talk but

328
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,209
I started to brainstorm you know about

329
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,270
three weeks ago

330
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:40,800
you know how could I do a talk focus on

331
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,630
what Dave asked me to speak on that is

332
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,979
positivity but also to do it the way

333
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,720
that can kind of help people and help

334
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,790
you in your career so I came up with

335
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,080
this talk info set career tips based on

336
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,550

friends of mine and I need you to tell

me who they are and then I'll tell you

352
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:31,120
the lesson that I learned from them this

353
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,100
is so kind of interactive call response

354
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,860
kind of thing you ready all right so

355
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,440
here's my first set of friends who are

356
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,380
these people

357
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,360
Phineas and Ferb and you can't forget

358
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,220
perry the platypus if you have not

359
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,720
watched Phineas and Ferb you are letting

360
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,459
yourself down you need to watch some

361
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,970
Phineas and Ferb this great stuff it's

362
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:54,339
very creative it's fun it's silly these

363
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,920
are two well three I guess of the most

364
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:57,790
creative individuals around they're

365
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,140
really incredible

366
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,939
they build like roller coasters in their

367
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,410
backyard they built a space shuttle they

368
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,209
do all these wonderful and amazing

369
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:08,230
science experiments they inspire me and

370
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:10,239
from them I've learned a really

371
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:13,600
important lesson this is a really big

372
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:17,110
lesson people often don't understand

373
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,870
creativity you know people think that

374
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:22,660
creativity is like I don't know like

375
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,600
Coke Zero inside a coke bottle and as

376
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,420
you pour it out you have less of it

377
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,100
right as you exercise your creativity

378
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,180
you have you have less crates if you've

379
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,190
poured it out right

380
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,560
no no nothing could be further from the

381
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:39,040
truth creativity is more like a muscle a

382
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,020
muscle that you work out and Bill the

383
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,240
more creative you are the more creative

384
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,279
you are kind of a tautology but you know

385
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,130
what I mean right and what can you learn

386
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,279
from this you'll learn from this create

387
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:53,350
start creating things whatever it is I

388
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,240
was just talking to a guy wonderful chap

389
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,790
last week and he said to me the

390
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,529
following there's like a like a knife in

391
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,390
my heart he said well I'm just not very

392
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:02,350
creative it's like dude well of course

393
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,880
you're not greater because you think

394
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,770
you're not creative start creating

395
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,470
things whatever your thing is maybe it's

396
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,760
poetry so write some poems maybe it's

397
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,440
music maybe it's

398
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,720
whoa watch out for the off-by-one bugs

399
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,540
but maybe it's code and you like to

400
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,940
write code start creating things

401
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,810
maybe it's graphical arts maybe you do a

402
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:26,290
derby Khan logo for Derby Cod next year

403
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:29,430
right Dave maybe something like that you

404
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:32,829
need to work out your creative muscles

405
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:35,319
like every day or at least three or four

406
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,160
times a week create something happen you

407
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,350
don't even have to share it with the

408
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,150
rest of the world but create create

409
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,160
create great all right you guys good

410
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,689
with that one I got another one I'm

411
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,709
gonna put up a friend here and I want

412
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:49,960
you to tell me who this friend is

413
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,790
Forrest Gump yes so for stuff he's a

414
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,470
fascinating guy Peck sometimes I joke

415
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,969
and say that I'm the Forrest Gump of the

416
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,470
information security industry because I

417
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,060
just kind of wander around and bump into

418
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,320
people I hey how's it going hey you know

419
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,209
you're nice to him and it's just

420
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,680
everything kind of works out right so

421
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,020
but what I learned from Forrest Gump is

422
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,199
actually pretty deep and pretty profound

423
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:11,319
and I strongly urge you to incorporate

424
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,660
this into your own interactions within

425
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:18,370
the cyber security industry here's what

426
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:21,219
I learned don't assume that you can't

427
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,380
learn from someone who is dumber than

428
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,680
your who isn't as smart as you think you

429
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:29,320
are I'll tell you I I'm a teacher I I do

430
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,719
some teaching for sans I'm a coach I'm a

431
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,610
mentor and there are some teachers who

432
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,790
will tell you there's no such thing as a

433
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:39,730
dumb question they're wrong there are

434
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:42,069
some mind-bogglingly stupid questions

435
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,350
they just are but here's something that

436
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:47,050
I do as an instructor as a coach as a

437
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,940
mentor if I get I'm sorry call you out

438
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,130
here but if I get a dumb question you

439
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,010
don't say well that's a dumb question

440
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:56,350
instead you have an obligation a sincere

441
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,819
and firm obligation to take that

442
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,800
question that let's admit it's not very

443
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,800
good it's dumb question and you turn

444
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:06,879
that into you dig deep and you turn that

445
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,770
into an amazing answer that answers that

446
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,690
direct question right there but also

447
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,440
builds on it so that the rest of the

448
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:15,970
audience says wow that's a really really

449
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,579
insightful question because it triggered

450
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:20,290
that amazing answer you say I had a

451
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,389
friend who took my sands class several

452
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,530
years ago his name was Osama not that if

453
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,510
I'm a different one

454
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,040
anyway he was taking the class and he

455
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,290
came up to me at the end of day two and

456
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,520
he said I see what you're doing I'm like

457
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,110
what do you mean you see what I'm doing

458
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,820
he said you're taking really stupid

459
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,070
questions and converting them into like

460
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,889
really insightful and smart answers like

461
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,300
nah I would never do that he says that's

462
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,010
what you're doing SCOTUS I'm on to you

463
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,460
I'm like whatever I don't know I don't

464
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:48,480
know so for day three four five and six

465
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,610
Osama said about trying to come up with

466
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,040
stupider and stupider and stupider

467
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,199
questions to put me through my paces wow

468
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,139
that was really something but but

469
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,520
there's a sincere point here and that is

470
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,260
maybe it is true that there's no such

471
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,940
thing as a dumb question because if it

472
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,680
is a dumb question that's on the

473
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,080
instructor or the coach or the mentor

474
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,190
that person didn't turn what might on

475
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,780
the surface seem like a dumb question

476
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,690
and is something actually interesting

477
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,600
deep and profound and you as instructors

478
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,640
as coaches as mentors need to do that

479
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,969
because at some level we're all thank

480
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,240
you

481
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,530
that person appreciated a point right

482
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,610
because we're all instructors mentors

483
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,560
and coaches at some point in our life

484
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,290
one other point I take from this forrest

485
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,720
gump thing you're probably not as smart

486
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,879
as you think you are I know I'm not in

487
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,620
fact I assume when I walk into a room

488
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,350
even a room with how many people are

489
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,939
here point how many 3,000 even when I

490
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,949
walk into a room with 3,000 people I

491
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,720
assume I'm the dumbest person there and

492
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:46,930
everything just kind of works out all

493
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,250
right you know so in information

494
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,760
security and cyber scared if you want to

495
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,950
call it that really you need to have

496
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,020
sort of an attitude where you're helping

497
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,760
the community and you're working with

498
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,010
people and not judging them based on

499
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,400
your perception of their intellectual

500
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:05,260
capability versus your own don't spend

501
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,570
time thinking about how smart you are

502
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,129
that is a complete waste of your time I

503
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,080
try to avoid it that sometimes your mind

504
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,820
kind of goes if forget it just say no

505
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,199
that's not interesting to me and if you

506
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,820
think about how smart or dumb other

507
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,790
people are that's really not a useful

508
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,439
use of your time either okay all right

509
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,639
let's go to our next one who do we have

510
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,490
next you ready you got to tell me who

511
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,260
this is

512
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,780
The Beatles yes you guys are really good

513
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,190
at this game all right I'm not focused

514
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,440
on all of the Beatles here I'd like to

515
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,429
focus on that one you see kind of in the

516
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,179
center of the picture where everybody

517
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:40,470
else is around him what's his name

518
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:42,059
Ringo Starr Ringo Starr very interesting

519
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,749
guy and what did I learn from my good

520
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:47,879
friend Ringo that might benefit you

521
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:53,220
surround yourself with people vastly

522
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:54,539
more talented than you yes now there are

523
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,279
maybe two or three people in this room

524
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,289
that are offended saying Ringo Starr was

525
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:01,769
a brilliant musician he was he was

526
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:04,139
fantastic but I'm comparing him to John

527
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:06,119
Lennon and Paul McCartney and George

528
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:07,799
Harrison in fact check this out there

529
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,709
was an interview once of John Lennon and

530
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:13,110
they asked John Lennon is Ringo Starr

531
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,299
the best drummer in the world and John

532
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:19,918
Lennon responded he's not even the best

533
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:21,809
drummer in the Beatles Wow but the point

534
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,580
is there have been surveys they survey

535
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:25,529
people say if you could go out and have

536
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,039
a drink with anyone of the Beatles which

537
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:31,259
one would you go out with and hands-down

538
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:32,999
Ringo Starr wins every time cuz we was

539
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:34,110
just kind of a good guy a fun guy look

540
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:37,080
you might want to go out with John

541
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,758
Lennon and I realize he's deceased but

542
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,529
living or dead which one would you want

543
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,519
to go out with Ringo Starr wins you

544
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:43,919
might want to go out with John Lennon

545
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,899
for amazing philosophical discussions or

546
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,950
Paul McCartney to discuss music or

547
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:48,360
something like that or George Harrison

548
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:51,740
to just get kind of weirded out or

549
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,779
something but anyway Ringo Starr

550
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,730
realized the power of surrounding

551
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:59,970
himself with some of the most talented

552
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:02,429
people ever and it turned out really

553
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,249
really well for him the lesson that I

554
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:09,149
take from this is most of life is not a

555
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:10,950
zero-sum game your success does not mean

556
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:13,949
my failure in fact I want to set things

557
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,299
up so that your success helps my success

558
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,799
and we work together and I want to

559
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:19,168
celebrate your victories I want to

560
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,499
celebrate your wins I want the world to

561
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:25,409
see how fantastic you are and then I'll

562
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:27,539
just bask in your glow right it's a

563
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,369
wonderful thing when somebody else does

564
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:31,769
well that doesn't mean you've done bad

565
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:34,080
you celebrate their victories celebrate

566
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:35,429
their win okay and like I told you this

567
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,658
is actually pretty easy for me to do

568
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,289
because I just assume I'm the stupidest

569
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,470
guy in the room

570
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:42,240
so I hire people who are smarter than me

571
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,860
that's the only people I hire it's not a

572
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,629
very hard thing to do you see alright

573
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,269
cuz I'm pretty dumb but the fact is I

574
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:49,750
already have me I don't need another me

575
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:51,790
I need people who are vast

576
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,380
better than me at a variety of different

577
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,020
things and I'm so honored to work with

578
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,430
the team that I'm able to work with all

579
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,470
right so that's what I learned from

580
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:03,010
Ringo Starr you ready for the next one

581
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:06,190
you don't sound ready now see okay my

582
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:08,230
sincere hope is well I understand that

583
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,990
not all of these tips will help all of

584
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,720
you but my hope is that some of the tips

585
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,070
will help some of you it might be that

586
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,780
two months from now or two years from

587
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,669
now you've got a decision to make or

588
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,440
you've got a thing to think through in

589
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,500
your career and maybe you won't remember

590
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,810
me but maybe you'll remember my friends

591
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,030
you'll remember the stories from these

592
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,429
friends that's my sincere hope so that

593
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,000
said are you ready now all right who's

594
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:36,310
next

595
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,040
who's this guy Santa Claus yeah you know

596
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:42,010
yeah so Santa Claus he's been chap right

597
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,899
have you ever thought about what Santa

598
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,879
faces and where he lives

599
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,500
I mean looks at the North Pole right you

600
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,010
think he's got a good gig going up there

601
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,130
right

602
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:55,060
actually the North Pole is a frozen

603
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:56,860
wasteland it is a land of scarcity there

604
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,870
ain't much up there right it's cold

605
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,250
the winters are terrible I mean thank

606
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:04,209
goodness we had Rudolph to say that one

607
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,980
time right but what Santa has done is he

608
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,520
has carved out something for himself up

609
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,770
at the North Pole

610
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,139
so that he and the elves and the

611
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,629
reindeer are able to not only sustain

612
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,660
themselves but they're able to share

613
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,170
holiday happiness and joy with the rest

614
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,020
of the world

615
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:23,320
in other words what Santa has is the

616
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:26,680
abundance mentality Santa doesn't look

617
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,450
at scarcity and say oh I don't have much

618
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,730
there's therefore not much that I can do

619
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,400
Santa says how can i leverage the

620
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,680
resources that I have om Albee it may be

621
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,230
limited but how can i leverage that to

622
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,480
invest in people and to help the

623
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,190
community that's what Santa really does

624
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,040
you see if you were focused on the

625
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:47,200
scarcity that will make your life

626
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:50,500
smaller and make you more limited and

627
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,020
makes you very risk-averse but if you

628
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,690
understand that through your skills and

629
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,450
talents in the most amazing industry

630
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,460
around cybersecurity you can actually

631
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,830
leverage things and help make your own

632
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,870
career better and

633
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,059
everyone else's this is the abundance

634
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,908
mentality and Santa is I just think a

635
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:11,549
fantastic example of it and what a great

636
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:13,559
community we have I mean it is I'll be

637
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:15,750
honest with you it is a pretty cool

638
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:17,220
place and time to work in cybersecurity

639
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,890
especially if you have the abundance

640
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,090
mentality jobs are plentiful I look I

641
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,049
understand sometimes people get laid off

642
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,000
different companies have different

643
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:26,970
things that they're doing and such the

644
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,429
economy can be a struggle but we have

645
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:32,250
very low unemployment in this industry

646
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:33,870
there is an abundance of work for us to

647
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,029
do in fact we have far more work than we

648
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,289
can actually do it is a great time in

649
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:39,750
this industry to have that abundance

650
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:42,809

to it

693

it's just kind of a natural human thing

694
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,980
you know things are going pretty well

695
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,230

712
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:10,110
don't know all right next one can you

713
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,300
see this very well who is that guy John

714
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,699
McClane he's from that little movie die

715
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,500
hard and in holiday hack challenge 2018

716
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,900
you found yourself in Santa's castle and

717
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,700
it becomes the Nok kotomi plaza and

718
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,590
you're stranded inside and when it's

719
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,050
under lockdown and hans gruber is trying

720
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:30,300
to extort santa claus so what did I

721
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:31,919
learn from John McClane persistence the

722
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,960
guy never gives up

723
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:37,410
persistence persistent even when he's by

724
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,650
himself he continues to move forward to

725
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:43,890
his prize but how does he do that he

726
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:47,460
does it by maintaining a light attitude

727
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:51,090
and a light touch he laughs at absurdity

728
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,250
the world is absurd it absolutely is and

729
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,889
he laughs at that absurdity not in a

730
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,660
mocking fashion but just in a humorous

731
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,370
and life fashion and one of the most

732
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,250
important points of being able to laugh

733
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:04,500
at absurdity is being able to laugh at

734
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,480
the absurdity in yourself because we're

735
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,740
all absurd in some way right that's just

736
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,930
part of the human condition

737
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,730
so being able to laugh at the

738
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,380
circumstances even when they're hard

739
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,240
sometimes finding that humor is

740
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,060
difficult but being able to laugh at

741
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,540
that and being able to laugh at yourself

742
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,970
absolutely vital

743
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,800
I thank John McClane for that lesson you

744
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,809
guys ready for the next one I think you

745
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,519
are cool who's this

746
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:30,859
MARY POPPINS yes what did I learn from

747
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:31,999
Mary she's a delightful lady I'm just he

748
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:33,499
can be a little Stern sometimes but

749
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:36,729
she's pretty cool here's what I learned

750
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:39,409
from her just a spoonful of sugar helps

751
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:41,330
the medicine go down I am NOT gonna sing

752
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:43,639
it for you like the lady here is you

753
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,749
sing very nicely but I've gone so just a

754
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,570
spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go

755
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:48,950
down on the surface all this means is if

756
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,450
you got to give somebody some some hard

757
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,729
news or some bad news or there's a lot

758
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,470
of work to be done try to sweeten it up

759
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:55,999
a little bit you know say some nice

760
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:57,710
things with your with your tough things

761
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:59,570
try to try to dance around while you're

762
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,599
doing all this hard work it does mean

763
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:05,059
that but there's actually more to it if

764
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,729
you dig into what my good friend Mary

765
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:10,820
Poppins told me it's that this is all

766
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:13,489
about empathy when you're talking to

767
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,710
people you have in your mind a mental

768
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:17,450
model of that person in my mind I have a

769
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,039
mental model of Dave Kennedy it's not

770
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,509
the perfect Dave Kennedy that's the

771
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,739
perfect Dave Kennedy but I have a model

772
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:24,229
when I talk to him I can kind of

773
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:27,049
anticipate how he's gonna respond to

774
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:29,179
various things that I say when you take

775
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:31,070
the advice of Mary Poppins hear what I'm

776
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:33,440
telling you to do is as you're talking

777
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:37,220
to someone you need to structure what

778
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,710
you're saying for them not for yourself

779
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,509
you got to think about how they will

780
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,820
interpret what you're saying and how

781
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:44,269
they will digest that and here's the

782
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,869
hard part

783
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:49,549
you need to dynamically alter the way

784
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:52,309
you're presenting your information based

785
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:54,289
on how you see that person absorbing the

786
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:55,340
information now explain this in the lab

787
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:57,590
the other day because I was working on

788
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,209
this talk and Daniel great guy I

789
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,678
remember I mentioned Daniel earlier he

790
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,979
said oh so what you're trying to say is

791
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,669
this this this and this and I'm like

792
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:08,330
actually it's not what I'm trying to say

793
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:10,369
at all in fact I didn't do what I said I

794
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:13,009
should do because I wasn't anticipating

795
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:15,529
that you would interpret it that way my

796
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:16,999
mental model of Daniel was inaccurate

797
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:20,119
so I adjusted us and so let me

798
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:21,649
reacquaint it again anyway empathy is

799
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:23,928
important put yourself into other

800
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:26,988
people's heads to think about how

801
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:29,119
they're perceiving what you say and what

802
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:31,340
you do it will make you more effective

803
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,139
as a communicator and somebody who has

804
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,269
the ability to get stuff done right

805
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:37,969
thank you Mary Poppins great for the

806
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:39,369
next one this one might be hard I think

807
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:46,610
you're up to it

808
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:48,369
who's this Lazlo who Lazlo Ali pal and

809
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,019
where's he from

810
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:52,970
real genius yes remember the real genius

812
00:30:52,970 --> 00:31:03,169
does he live he lives in the closet in

813
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:08,090
the steam tunnels underneath the

814
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:09,639
university that's absolutely right so do

815
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:16,759
you want to hear a little secret

816
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:18,850
no no Derby Khan's cancelled have a nice

817
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:21,999
day no you guys want to hear a secret

818
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:26,918
all right let me tell you a secret

819
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:31,940
always have a secret room and what I

820
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:34,039
what I mean by this is it's a

821
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,929
storytelling tip I teach a class on how

822
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,919
to do storytelling and I think Jeff's

823
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:38,629
been in the classroom the other people

824
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:40,249
been in the class um so it's just on how

825
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:43,549
to tell stories and one of the advanced

826
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:47,059
storytelling techniques is to have a

827
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:48,499
secret they say that the four the four

828
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:49,428
most powerful words in the English

829
00:31:48,499 --> 00:31:52,850
language for getting somebody's

830
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:54,080
attention are I need your help

831
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,969
did you notice I started this

832
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,609
presentation with I need your help and

833
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:00,230
then I think the second most powerful

834
00:31:58,609 --> 00:32:03,080
words in the English language to get

835
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,869
someone's attention is I have a secret

836
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,070
or want to hear a secret because people

837
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:07,850
like well of course why wouldn't want to

838
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,470
hear a secret you get their attention

839
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,719
they might be face off he's telling a

840
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:16,429
secret right now so I'm sorry it's just

841
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:18,320
as simple as a story to say join your

842
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:19,609
secret you got their attention they want

843
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,379
it you gotta have something to tell them

844
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:21,710
that's interesting at least right all

845
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:24,230
right

846
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,759
so always have a secret room almost

847
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,440
always have a secret in your story

848
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,590
something that you reveal it doesn't

849
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,909
have to be so much hey I've got a secret

850
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,580
or want to hear a secret

851
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:36,289
you could withhold some information

852
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,509
that's important to your story to keep

853
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:40,279
your person kind of tug along I remember

854
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:41,899
I first came across this technique about

855
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:44,600
ten years ago in storytelling and I was

856
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:46,070
experimenting with it and I would hold

857
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,019
back certain parts of stories as I was

858
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,369
telling the stories and I wasn't doing

859
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:51,409
it very well I was kind of ham-fisted in

860
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:52,590
the whole thing and it was pissing my

861
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:53,970
wife off

862
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,409
I'd be telling some story and she

863
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:56,670
started asking me questions about this

864
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,650
or that that I was like not like I'm

865
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,810
leaving that out I'll tell you later no

866
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:03,060
no no so the easiest way to implement

867
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:05,010
this technique in storytelling is just

868
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,110
simply to say want to hear a secret

869
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,190
there are more subtle ways to do that

870
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,270
where you withhold information but

871
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,980
they're hard and I'm still working on

872
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,360
myself all right you ready for the next

873
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,630
one

874
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:18,899
cool who's this guy

875
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:21,870
Doc Brown fantastic what did I learn

876
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,360
from Doc Brown Doc Brown taught me that

877
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:27,570
you need to continually experiment and

878
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,850
learn in your own laboratory how many

879
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,379
people here have a laboratory where they

880
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,959
can do their technical Hansel's that's

881
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,400
fantastic if you did not raise your hand

882
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,470
because you don't have a laboratory you

883
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,230
must get one you have to build yourself

884
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:43,200
a laboratory places where you can go and

885
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:45,360
experiment and just see how the various

886
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,520
information systems the very cyber

887
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,830
equipment ICS whatever it is that your

888
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,810
gig how it's actually functioning in the

889
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,310
real world and you can only do that if

890
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:56,210
you have a laboratory and that you have

891
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:59,159
dedicated time to invest in yourself

892
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:00,990
working in that laboratory seriously if

893
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,600
you don't have a lab get one you might

894
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,710
say well I'm not a technical person we

895
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,290
should be I mean at least a little bit

896
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:09,090
right set up a Windows box and look at

897
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,770
how it's the password settings work so

898
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:13,679
just start experimenting grow more and

899
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:15,389
more and more yes cool and look I know

900
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,770
there's plentiful jobs that aren't

901
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,330
involved with technical work in

902
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,770
cybersecurity I do get that but

903
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:21,029
everybody kind of amping up a little of

904
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,739
their technical knowledge through their

905
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:27,919
own laboratory would serve this industry

906
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:30,870
well right cool next who's this guy

907
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:33,480
Billy Joel I went through this talk in

908
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:36,149
the office the other day and pretty much

909
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,730
nobody recognized him yeah does anybody

910
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:43,489
recognize not only Billy Joel but the

911
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:47,730
video of which song this still came from

912
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:50,790
keeping the faith this is something this

913
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:54,060
one line from this one song really

914
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:56,429
really powerful the good old days

915
00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:00,150
weren't always good and tomorrow's not

916
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:03,060
as bad as it seems right I think that

917
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,140
every day every day it just comes to me

918
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,390
I wouldn't have to make a point of

919
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,770
thinking it it just happens in my brain

920
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,390
you know the good old days weren't

921
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,870
always good tomorrow's not as bad as it

922
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,210
seems

923
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:14,100
why is this so important and meaningful

924
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:18,750
to me when my good friend Billy Joel

925
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:20,759
told me about it I really like history I

926
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:23,130
really like the past it just comes like

927
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,050
I built myself a giant steam punk office

928
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,550
because I like that I collect antiques

929
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:28,500
and things like a usually antique

930
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,180
cryptosystems or antique electric

931
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,850
gadgets and stuff because it just it's

932
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:35,250
fun for me and I thought to myself where

933
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:38,700
I think to myself why is it that I like

934
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:41,040
the Past so much what is it about it you

935
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,779
know I'm talking like 100 years ago 150

936
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,450
years ago 500 years ago a thousand years

937
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,500
ago 20 years ago right for some of you

938
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,020
20 years ago seems like a really long

939
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,700
time right why do I like the Past so

940
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,259
much and I thought well first of all

941
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,390
there's some great stories and I love

942
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,950
stories stories are fantastic but then I

943
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,480
thought it's not just the stories it's

944
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:01,290
also the people there's some fascinating

945
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,670
people from those time frames right but

946
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:07,800
then when I get really honest with

947
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:10,110
myself I want to hear secret when I get

948
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,420
really honest with myself I say I think

949
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,180
the reason I like the past so much is

950
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,940
because I know how it turns out it's

951
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:20,549
safe there were some really bad times in

952
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,570
the past right World War one I don't

953
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,080
think this is going to be controversial

954
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:28,200
World War one sucked anybody disagree

955
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,930
that's shot what a disaster or the

956
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,089
so-called civil war man that was a what

957
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:35,279
a train wreck that was right

958
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,200
bad bad bad stuff but I know how it

959
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,280
turns out and we kind of made it through

960
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,980
right so the past has sort of abounded

961
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:47,220
badness to it Nazism Hitler all that

962
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,570
stuff sucked it was bad but I kind of

963
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,850
know how it turned out and I think

964
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,260
that's why I like the past because you

965
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:55,520
know we don't know how it's gonna turn

966
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:59,040
out going forward the future is scary

967
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,750
who knows what's gonna happen right but

968
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,000
I remind myself the good old days

969
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,990
weren't always good and tomorrow's not

970
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,480
as bad as it seems

971
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:09,299
now what's out of that equation you got

972
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,300
the past you got the future tomorrow

973
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,820
what's left out of there the present and

974
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,360
I'm here to tell you the present is the

975
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:20,320
only thing you have any control over so

976
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,260
leverage that control

977
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,570
to make tomorrow better you see them

978
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,220
saying here really really important you

979
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:29,290
can't really control the future you

980
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,850
can't really control the past you can

981
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,920
learn more about the past and because of

982
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:35,549
what you learn in the past you can act

983
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,990
in the present to influence the future

984
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:40,990
think about it that way but the present

985
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:43,930
is all we have my friends so savor the

986
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:46,120
present and work in the present to make

987
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:48,279
the future a better place Billy Joel

988
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,630
told me to tell you and if you look at

989
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,840
our industry I move it to this a little

990
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:57,070
bit earlier our industry this time is so

991
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,260
incredible because there's so much

992
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:01,720
dynamism so many things happening in

993
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,070
this industry not only is it good jobs

994
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,299
with an abundance mentality kind of

995
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:07,360
stuff they talk about with Santa Claus

996
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,640
but also is a great place to contribute

997
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,670
to the community it's a great place for

998
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,580
you to be a mentor or an instructor or a

999
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:18,790
coach to help out other people so you

1000
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:21,610
can invest your skills your capabilities

1001
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:24,070
your creativity to help make the future

1002
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:26,020
a better place and that's what derbycon

1003
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,070
was all about Charlie Brown Charlie

1004
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,990
Brown's not in here but that is what

1005
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:33,840
their becomes all about now I have two

1006
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:35,649
more for you okay next one who's this

1007
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:39,040
the Cat in the Hat

1008
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:40,900
but let's not focus on the character

1009
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,870
let's focus on the person who created

1010
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:47,470
the character who created this character

1011
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:50,080
dr. Seuss also known as Theodore Geisel

1012
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:52,180
yes yes he said something dr. Seuss said

1013
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,450
something really important powerful and

1014
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:58,690
reflecting on the last derbycon I

1015
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,980
thought this and I saw this dr. Seuss

1016
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,530
has been telling me this for years but

1017
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,730
when I first heard this is the last

1018
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,760
derbycon here's the first thing that

1019
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:10,210
came in my mind don't cry because it's

1020
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,810
over Dave Kennedy smile because it

1021
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,860
happened

1022
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:18,180
isn't that lovely yes so what this is is

1023
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:21,220
it's about savoring things even after

1024
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,750
they're pass you see and that's gonna

1025
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,180
help you get to the future better this

1026
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,350
is so beautiful and so powerful I had to

1027
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,669
put it up I'm sorry to personalize it to

1028
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,460
say Dave Kennedy but it's for every

1029
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:33,519
single one of you right don't cry

1030
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:37,719
because it's over smile because we had

1031
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:39,488
9 der because 9 of the darn things is

1032
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:41,169
that incredible think about it you're

1033
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:44,319
not entitled in life to even wonder

1034
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:46,118
become and some people raise your hand

1035
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:48,308
got nine I only got 7 because I missed

1036
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:51,549
the first two but that is wonderful

1037
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:53,859
and honestly derbycon is sort of by this

1038
00:39:51,549 --> 00:39:56,229
community as Dave mentioned this morning

1039
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:58,929
when you open things up it's gonna

1040
00:39:56,229 --> 00:40:01,479
continue maybe not in a conference forum

1041
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:03,399
like this but instead in a community

1042
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:05,499
through various other conferences

1043
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:07,598
through various projects that people do

1044
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:09,098
through our memories our discussions

1045
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,059
through the friendships that we've made

1046
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:14,409
here derbycon as a conference is drawing

1047
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:16,539
to a close in a couple days we still

1048
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:19,839
have one more left right but there

1049
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:22,119
because it's not over I have one more

1050
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,459

1055
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:45,279

1056
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:48,669
Esquire and Ted Theodore Logan yes these

1057
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:51,880
profound philosophers have a lot to

1058
00:40:48,669 --> 00:40:54,279
offer us so much of what was their

1059
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,799
mantra that they imparted into the world

1060
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:58,329
what was it that they tried to tell

1061
00:40:56,799 --> 00:41:02,829
everyone that followed the wild

1062
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:06,279
stallions well be excellent to each

1063
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:08,439
other this is this is my call to you as

1064
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:11,009

1065
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:13,839
wonderful night derbycon

1066
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:15,819
and that is be excellent to each other

1067
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,189
now what does that mean it means not

1068
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:20,729
only treating people well and being

1069
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:26,379
positive and supporting each other

1070
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:27,698
it also means frankly loving them now I

1071
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,939
know that's kind of hard sometimes right

1072
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:32,679
sometimes people are pretty darn

1073
00:41:29,939 --> 00:41:35,529
unlovable but you need to love them

1074
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:37,239
anyway you know be excellent to each

1075
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:40,029
other oh wait but that's not their

1076
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:42,029
entire mantra what's the whole manager

1077
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:46,119

1078

1114
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,999
already mentioned some but I tell you

1115
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,259
why Wes had confessed is fantastic John

1116
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:43,430
strand and his team at Black Hills

1117
00:43:42,259 --> 00:43:44,930
information security do a great

1118
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:46,640
conference they're been to so far I've

1119
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:48,379
been to both of them I spoke at both of

1120
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,390
them I'm gonna speak at this one oh and

1121
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,979
I got a weird talk for this one oh my

1122
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:53,359
god Lee different with this talk but I

1123
00:43:51,979 --> 00:43:55,759
I'll be speaking at wild west Hackett

1124
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:58,130
fest comes up what is it October or

1125
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:59,869
something and so that's a great one I do

1126
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,209
love shmoocon I've been to many of the

1127
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:04,009
years of shmoocon I go to Def Con you

1128
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:05,660
know I know some people think Def Con is

1129
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:07,400
just way too big my advice to you is

1130
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,149
don't think of DEFCON as a conference

1131
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,309
because it's way too big

1132
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:12,499
think of it as a series of small cons

1133
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:13,519
and it makes it much more digestible and

1134
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:14,808
don't get upset when you can't go to

1135
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,209
everything because you can't go to

1136
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:19,130
everything so when I kind of flip my

1137
00:44:17,209 --> 00:44:20,538
view of Def Con as a series of very

1138
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:27,829
small cons I started to love it again

1139
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:29,719
yeah yes sir Kringle kahn - dude yeah

1140
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:32,269
this is for you sir enjoy enjoy alright

1141
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:34,009
I have one more parting gift here I have

1142
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,479
not just so you know I took it from my

1143
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:36,459
hotel room I did not use it today

1144
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:38,808
it

1145
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:42,169
so the gentleman asked about Kringle con

1146
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:44,839
- so last year Santa Claus told me that

1147
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:46,789
he wanted to host a free conference at

1148
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:47,989
the North Pole now I don't know if

1149
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:49,160
you've ever traveled to the North Pole

1150
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:51,289
but travel conditions are quite

1151
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:55,339
treacherous up there but through the

1152
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:57,380
magic of an html5 browser with cascading

1153
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:59,719
style sheets you could just get

1154
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:02,119
transported to the North Pole to see a

1155
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:03,709
series of talks and we ran Kringle con

1156
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,049
one last year

1157
00:45:03,709 --> 00:45:07,049
crema con one was the success we had 22

1158
00:45:06,049 --> 00:45:09,420
speakers

1159
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:11,730
Dave Kennedy keynoted it thank you Dave

1160
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,560
if by the way it's still up you can go

1161
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,540
and watch Dave's keynote from last

1162
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,460

1163
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:19,800
superb we asked all the speakers to

1164
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,030
present like 12 to 18 minutes of stuff

1165
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,240
because you're watching it inside of

1166
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:27,720
Santa's castle Dave they took I think 48

1167
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,479
minutes um but it's Dave Kennedy so it's

1168
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:33,509
all good so Santa was so delighted with

1169
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,640
how Kringle con one went he is now going

1170
