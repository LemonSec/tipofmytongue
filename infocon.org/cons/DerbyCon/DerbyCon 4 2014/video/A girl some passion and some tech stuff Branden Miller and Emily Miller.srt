3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:24,820
I thank you guys for coming this is a
combination of

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,130
over a year's worth of work most of it
done by my daughter Emily

5
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,790
which started this winter she was 13 and

6
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,550
it's basically after hounding salmon

7
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,809
and joining along for months and months
and months and months we finally started

8
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:42,360
doing something about it

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,039
and thanks for coming so

10
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,280
miss my daughter Emily so

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,719
an I love nature photography and I take

12
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,940
like 50 pictures every day most in the
same object

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,870
own 14 and I have a sister rather

14
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,140
and I'm Christian and the last linus

15
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,420
really how we got on this line at work
so just so you know you're wondering

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,150
I'm Brandon Miller I'm just a pajama
wearing hipster I love drinking

17
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,170
hot cocoa and talking about health care
of my family a Christmas

18
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,330
I love my onesies I'm an analyst

19
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,979
I do that not because I'm really good at
it it's because it pays the bills now

20
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:26,759
like to shoot

21
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,240
and being addition analysts makes me a
lot of money so that we can shoot a lot

22
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,630
so we should as a family are slim a dad
has been I too am a Christian

23
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,700
so what this talk is not

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,780
it's not groundbreaking we were really

25
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,060
we as in once again she whatever if I
say we hear I just assume I'm talking

26
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,850
about my daughter

27
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:51,509
up this is more of a growth experience
for us

28
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,509
we pretty much wanted to do something
together

29
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,840
arm we homeschool and in doing so

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,259
my wife and I responsible with coming up
with a lot of our own curriculum

31
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:06,280
obviously we don't go you know door on
math because that's been around for a

32
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,860
long time

33
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,640
but we do our own science is a lot of
times I'm

34
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,349
once again it's not groundbreaking
everything that we've done will be

35
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:14,379
linked to you

36
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,069
so that you could do this yourself when
it things always tell people is

37
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,069
he don't have to go to Africa or

38
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:24,849
South America or Russia to do good

39
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:28,379
you can walk out front to the hotel and
start doing good

40
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:32,920
so one of the initiatives that that I've
been discussing with the

41
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,970
a friend of mine a ghost church as
actually doing something like this

42
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,379
just at a local after school program I
targeting Hispanic students

43
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,200
at Rachel Rachel system is also in
Spanish so it's really nice

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,400
I'm but he focuses on migrant workers

45
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,519
and the Lexington Kentucky area so
that's where we're from

46
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:01,129
and for us it was a call to serve so
little bit a background for getting to

47
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,790
that the technical stuff that my
daughters gonna talk about

48
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,120
my daughter got her first camera in 2005

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,170
and that's her in the pink has won a
Barbie camera took about 15 pictures

50
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,430
and she outgrew that camera within a
couple days

51
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,060
I shed she will take multiple pictures
the same object

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,599
to try to determine what lighting as
best and how best to do this

53
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,019
she started doing at age five show

54
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,280
we know we're kind of in trouble earlier
is going to be an expensive endeavor

55
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,680
and the next year for the next summer

56
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,040
my family my in Los all went to

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,640
a I went on a mission trip to you guys
are

58
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,530
sorry Uganda summer bring up and help it
he said back so they're bit late

59
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,680
to Kenya the Rift Valley area of Kenya
to do a medical mission trip

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,069
that's my father in law out whenever
they came back and a shirt on about

61
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,010
their experiences in their stories

62
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,659
Emily who at that time was age six
declared that she's going

63
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:02,129
to Kenya so we had to actually explain
her

64
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:06,599
out a six year old can go to Kenya
Marcel show she agreed to wait

65
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,709
a couple years so much six years later
this is my

66
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,840
my mother-in-law and a physician that we
actually helped push through

67
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,190
medical school and her name is

68
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,169
grace I was get names wrong seven
actually met these people you're

69
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,520
its next year abzug restarted the
connection aimed at Somerset Medical

70
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,270
Clinic

71
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,650
and that's our kinda her saying

72
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,180
hey thanks to the town of Somerset
Kentucky for helping her

73
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,430
om and thanks to my mother in law since
she was from Somerset

74
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,610
it's not hard to finance some money for
medical school in Africa cost about

75
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,669
twenty five hundred dollars

76
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,639
so think you know we think a medical
schools a couple hundred thousand

77
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,120
dollars

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,070
yeah show whenever they came back

79
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,120
obviously they told more stories Emily
continued to complain that

80
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,240
its you know her time to go are we hold
her back

81
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,229
and finally and 2012

82
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:09,460
arm we didn't acre but her

83
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,770
what what they did was they adopted a
school before we

84
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,860
cared for the clinic and an orphanage

85
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,880
and now we've adopted a school it's a
masai tribal school

86
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,210
and literally this picture does not does
does not do justice to the isolation of

87
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,220
the school

88
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,479
you drive for two hours

89
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:33,250
yea you do for our drive for hours on go
past san kau

90
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,810
paths and washouts like a

91
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,210
streams and such in and of itself feel
are just across the field yet

92
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,550
and there's a school out of nowhere and
it's like i said im aside travel

93
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:52,550
school and as about 200 students we've
adopted the school

94
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,130
when I finally got to go we had found a
spike

95
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,610
or finish school thing well

96
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,620
you look well called I don't know the
name

97
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,900
min aflutter it's an orange but they
can't afford to send the kids to school

98
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,139
cousin can you have to pay her public
school

99
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,840
so they homeschool yeah

100
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,169
and so we're gonna build 'em this a will

101
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,310
a room for them to use school

102
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,419
Nanded up actually putting the girls in
their sleep cuz

103
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,660
it was a nice is building him you tire
neighborhood

104
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,550
so whenever she came back she said

105
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,630
I don't wanna just do-gooder Africa but
I want to be an artist

106
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,039
and I'm not an artist I know nothing
about

107
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,699
art someone once said you know our

108
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,460
because it looks pretty I don't think
any of the stuff that I ever she looks

109
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,900
pretty so

110
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,819
sat me so my goal was to divert her
attention and that's when it was started

111
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,560
the actual build try to take this

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,280
okay Emily out a lot a lot of
frustration out of this process because

113
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,930
like I said

114
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,130
I didn't do you hardly anything I made
her do just about everything

115
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,840
arm but basically what we did was a
built-in XBMC server

116
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,990
as a perfect concept and to keep
whenever she went to Africa

117
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,000
so this is what Emily actually don't
mean

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,039
we use the Raspberry Pi more and

119
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,240
thirty-five dollars wifi dongle

120
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,680
and of course quiet XBMC load on it

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,190
we still run this is a media server and
a house but I am

122
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,599
installed Windows seven what's up ol

123
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,039
yes mention a legal case so

124
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,479
on I stole his really nice case to take
the canyon

125
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,169
and to say sorry I built in this really
awesome okay

126
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:58,400
in she discovered later ok at if you've
never dealt with Lego can it's wonderful

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
it's really good arm she had

128
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,180
choose laptops that were donated to us
one of them was a a

129
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,319
Lenovo ThinkPad I made her do a fresh
install of Windows seven so that she can

130
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,220
understand

131
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,889
are daily anger if you've ever loaded
Windows operating system

132
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:20,669
arm in in for lanix arm on the
Chromebook that we had

133
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,650
we actually installed Kurt honest nobody
ever used her time

134
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,139
it's wonderful say have a Chromebook
rates running Chrome

135
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,590
you in stock rutan it allows you to put

136
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,810
just about any buildable NX on there
that you want and what it does

137
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,839
is it actually allows for you to quickly
without rebooting the system

138
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,300
go from a West OS it's literally a
keystroke annette little it almost looks

139
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,399
like VMware suspends 1

140
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,260
and then it brings up the other one such
really nice

141
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,610
then the the next part of the plan was
for her to go to Kenya

142
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,820
I was gonna go but it didn't work out my
wife went instead

143
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,540
install this learning network in in the

144
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,010
the school or the or orphanage emily is
gonna teach the staff

145
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,720
which much probably the other fresh
traction we hadn't talked about that in

146
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,540
a minute

147
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,920
and then our ultimate goal was just to
talk Chula con

148
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,410
as more Michael I'll be honest a Spanish
book on

149
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,899
year after year after year in every at
selected session minute Emily and said

150
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:23,850
basically

151
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,360
I have to go to cuz she's a minor and
they let me go

152
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,200
I finally got mushrooms on to get I

153
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,290
so how it actually happened were

154
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:42,709
so which is named Sam yes same sam se i
Sam

155
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,060
a.m. he basically followed him around

156
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,490
and like you tell me how to do this

157
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,490
and like that own which

158
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,630
we bought the Raspberry Pi best XBMC

159
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,820
server like we're going to the first
place a bill to racial pilot Kenya

160
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,680
total school building bid up using as a

161
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,370
house unsold ritual part stop the staff

162
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,250
and then we get to speak at all these
got to get

163
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,470
smoke on Marshall University aid Lexmark

164
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,820
can and yeah circles

165
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,950
emily is actually a professor now so if
you are services just let us know

166
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,700
and then you know you pay for travel
show up and talk about anything

167
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,410
yeah

168
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,540
so these other steps to build a racial
pie it's really simple if you just gotta

169
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,779
world possible but

170
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,860
org and follows six easy steps

171
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,410
you too can be a master engineer

172
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,140
I'm but basically just buy it yup put it
together

173
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,110
and then you flash the shopper that's it

174
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,800
so if you can do the six things you can
have an education server that you can

175
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,430
deploy

176
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,170
so I was really proud of him when she
actually shut up budget for herself up

177
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,260
one hundred dollars to do this

178
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,329
she raised 0 almost two thousand dollars
but the ball covet

179
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,230
wish to go towards a a good generator

180
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,190
the school hands the orphanage both have
generators

181
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,600
but they're horrible arm

182
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,740
on the server popcorn maker have so
we're going to go to the school make

183
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,600
them pop corn is like a week

184
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,190
are here we're going to keep up on thank
so we would

185
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,640
to make the popcorn and the little light

186
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,010
that he the 10 thing start its Billy but

187
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,779
explanation but it just kept flickering
turning off

188
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,279
and you like two colonels to pop and
nothin and generator

189
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,500
just who have so that's what she wants
to do the rest money

190
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,540
we basically paid about eighty eight
dollars for this particular bill

191
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,019
arm once again about the expense the
server she but the case for me

192
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:06,019
are sick II she did all the work I am

193
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:09,450
the only thing I did miss whole process
was actually download their

194
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,490
the Rachel by software but now

195
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,510
it's a 32 gig bill but Hirscher charity
actually has a 64 get bill

196
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,850
which provides a lot more offline
content

197
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,920
if you don't have a good connection you
can still

198
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,160
operator school so it's really nice

199
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,089
that's the build its on our Pelican pie
that we're gonna bring back

200
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:37,820
she install the OS

201
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,300
we stayed up till like midnight trying
to make this thing work

202
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,139
for them to come in the pajamas and he
wouldn't

203
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:50,860
might need you anything except watch it
and my rose ready I had to get in

204
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,430
news like taking a nap and drinking
coffee in are just sitting there

205
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,160
watching the screeners like

206
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,170
when is this going to be done

207
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,410
so we basically put it all together this
kinda the whole kit

208
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,620
I want things I made her do was
brainstorming try to figure out what

209
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,760
happened you know if something goes
wrong what do I do

210
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,779
has once again I wasn't gonna be in
country and my wife knows

211
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:17,769
how to turn on her computer most days
she wasn't going to be a much help

212
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:21,930
arm emily went to Kenya without me

213
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,980
once again our space to go not better at
all

214
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,360
up this was the actual I'll this is
where the boy slut

215
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,410
so what they did was on the outside the
house they took anything they could to

216
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,870
make walls and a ceiling

217
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,649
they put it together and the boy shut
their the girl slip inside the house

218
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,260
so they built a school

219
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,660
misses the completed school and once
again like em I said once the

220
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,800
owner saw all the school she basically
said

221
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,209
this the best building in the neighbor
house our neighborhood we're going to

222
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,940
use that as the dormitory

223
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,420
for the girls the whole school in the
house

224
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,870
ima try to make it work but she you
realize that's

225
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,190
this building there and didn't have
power

226
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,470
once again that a generator that doesn't
really work well for extended periods of

227
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,980
time

228
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,100
so she you one issue into the van has
really proud over at this moment

229
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,360
proud daddy mommy here she decided the
van has electricity let's go to the van

230
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,060
problem with vehicles and things like
voltage regulators and vehicles over

231
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,410
there

232
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,540
is they don't put out a sustained power
level

233
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,670
so she couldn't get the Rachel paperwork

234
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,699
him so

235
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:44,230
what she did was one of the people that
remain

236
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,459
and just outside in Nairobi Kenya at all
times and helps us

237
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:53,579
is this lady and she actually is a
manager about level western-style hotel

238
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:58,029
and so what she does she get up to the
orphanage sometimes twice a week

239
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:02,040
and she's kind of our liaison right now
she runs on ARM edition to the to the

240
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,949
orphanage

241
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:06,820
and anytime wish and her something for
updates or whatever it might be

242
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,550
she does that for us and then the best
part

243
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,529
we got to go on a safari

244
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:20,010
on the first day we saw like by million
for animals

245
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,910
an ounce like there are some missus how
do much

246
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,709
good for you

247
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:32,370
literally like this do you mean like
this flute

248
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,759
literally how close it was

249
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,470
just a dying to know some kinda Canon
thing your mother company

250
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,040
candy 6 you know anything about cameras

251
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,310
and there was a leopard in the tree and
like followed us

252
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,570
salesman Newsome

253
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,810
little so the lessons learned were

254
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,509
number one reg price for easy to build I
made Emily and install all the drivers

255
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,240
may knowing

256
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,339
which was a mistake on both our parts I
am

257
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,790
I wasn't thinking about that one she has
become an excellence

258
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,009
%ah user of Google as a resource

259
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:16,019
so the I'm proud over a nap I am

260
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,800
if you gotta roll possible to or can use
their parks listener build list

261
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,199
make sure you use exactly what they
recommend cousin you'll have to load

262
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:25,449
drivers manually

263
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:28,630
on a Linux system Murray didn't know
what H

264
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,810
a prompt was or command minus so

265
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,290
and they recommend a one-out power
supply matter for use in wireless you

266
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,250
really need 1.5 answer more

267
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:43,230
because the dongles draw a lot of power

268
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,350
more lessons learned i doesn't work on
dirty power

269
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,389
the next build that we're taking is
actually a

270
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,630
a pelican pie and this isn't one this
one

271
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:57,589
a HF she was so gracious let us borrow
cuz I left mine in the garage

272
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:01,490
but it has up our in has a

273
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,230
about a 12 hour battery and it actually
has a solar panel

274
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,630
up show we we hit that mark

275
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,309
which some bought the generator will be
doing that when we go back

276
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:16,689
I always have a backup plan and Emily
discovered that Lin H

277
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,520
for new users even just a fear operating

278
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,780
you know you're not doing anything you
know as a sis Minister

279
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,959
would love it too difficult actually a
lot difficult

280
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,190
even graced the lady that manages the
the the hotel who

281
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,210
knows it. had difficult times with it

282
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,470
show we basically just left the
Chromebook as is

283
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,590
didn't even show on how to use we as in
she

284
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,230
so which book at Shrek on we thought
that was going to be the end

285
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,039
arm that %uh speaking that's me
financial got

286
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,590
and my daughter course and then john
yang

287
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,760
came up on stage and this is significant
because number one he's done on

288
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,919
and number two he gave us

289
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,660
the Pelican pie with one condition

290
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,419
and we had to finish so that was really
cool so the same

291
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:14,289
Sep same spat a lot of the night

292
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:18,350
definitely the afternoon a building are
helping build the main

293
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,820
Emily do most of the work so what's next
this this is really kind of our

294
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,450
glass fiber but the wrap it up we're
going

295
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,789
in June I to Uganda first

296
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:33,000
we're gonna be they the basically

297
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,539
whatever johnnie tells us to do we're
gonna do you are there for a week

298
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:41,210
and we're gonna go to Kenya and we're
gonna follow up with five goals

299
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,470
arm number one we're gonna

300
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,419
visit the orphanage that we support
gonna be there for two days at least

301
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,710
for and do some modifications to the
building for an installer generator

302
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,340
and Iran to replace their Rachel pie
with the Pelican pie

303
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,799
I number two we're going to go back to
the masai travel school

304
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,270
and where we've actually got a student
identified their

305
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,080
that is going to be our focal point he's

306
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,280
because I want to a junior he has the
respect of all the kids

307
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,789
so he tells dahmer Astana do something
that they do it

308
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:19,660
more so than that a lot of the teachers
I am

309
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,190
and he's just from a long my wife was
telling me

310
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,980
he just is a sponge for knowledge and he
loves doing things with his hands so

311
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,350
he's gonna be our guy

312
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,760
I'm once again Emily wants to buy a
generator

313
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,390
are we're gonna provide more computers
for the kids in the orphanage we left

314
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,740
them the two computers

315
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,450
about Lexmark actually donated six
computers

316
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,410
I am i spoke there and they basically
said

317
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,360
wanna wanna manner said come to my desk
we wanna give something to you in a six

318
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,990
computers that was nice

319
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,929
a stock in a friend of mine go ahead yet
guess who got to carry them all out to

320
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,090
the car

321
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,570
the purposes of this is a learning
experience remember if a daughter

322
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,260
right I was talking a friend of mine a
an RC services they have a booth

323
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,090
upstairs

324
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,799
after shot out for them because whenever
I said hey you know

325
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,950
Lexmark actually give six computer she
said all wanna

326
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,960
that's a gave six computers too and some
other stuff

327
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,770
that's really nice arm and then once
again or to replace the

328
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,360
ra Rachel pie with the Pelican Pike it
and I hope to get a break

329
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,980
johnnie talk about the breaker earlier I
don't know exactly how many years have

330
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,789
been talking a

331
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:35,870
to Sam and Sam's gonna can't be a lot
more pointers

332
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:40,190
arm here's our resources she'll be able
to see everything that we did this is

333
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,880
all

334
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,179
basically what Emily used for oliver
builds

335
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:47,190
and then last thing on to bring these
guys up

336
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,360
your talk about the brick look at more
just in case I didn't hear about it

337
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,360
johnnie long same catch

338
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:05,730
let's not look for us at the park for
these guys

339
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,929
after say these guys because I we don't
put the whole focus on her yeah

340
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:13,490
maker totally embarrassing them as I put
the focus on her

341
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,210
well the I I was really blown away by
the story obviously I thought it was

342
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,450
really cool that

343
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,690
for salsa father-daughter project I'm it
involved

344
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,870
bunch a different levels the technology
right I'm everything

345
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,150
from fuzzy zero level being an industry
sort of understanding how things work

346
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,340
training his daughter's certain new to
the industry to the folks that are in

347
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,659
Kenya that had like

348
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:38,159
he said she was involved in it. but that
doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot

349
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,799
here all the way down to the students 0
technical knowledge

350
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,340
in kinda pull it all together in a
project that's designed to

351
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,840
put a virtual library in a school filled
with knowledge

352
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,010
you know this just operates on every
level and I thought

353
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,490
that was want things that really struck
me about the project

354
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,559
um so somebody might be a look at this
and you might be interested in this and

355
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,510
thinking on

356
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,950
him really wanna go to Kenya early wanna
go to Uganda's their stuff that we can

357
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,789
do in the answer is absolutely

358
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:09,840
there's lots of problems with the both
all the solutions that we have

359
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,460
everything's from from the Chromebooks
to the Pelican pie

360
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,200
to other BRIC which I'm going to talk
about and many people that can

361
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,210
that can help us in that arena from
right where you are years plugin in cuba

362
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,429
suggestions

363
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:26,179
and of course there's always room for
people to come on trips the Pelican pi

364
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,679
is really great this is

365
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,080
what they're gonna be taking to Kenya
things that is in June yes you guys are

366
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,110
gone

367
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,010
and coming to Uganda with that it's a
great project because these guys are

368
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,640
understand it and they build it and they
put it together and they can

369
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,770
troubleshoot it

370
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,600
they mention the brick and the reason
that we're looking at the bricks is

371
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,360
because

372
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,690
in some cases these things

373
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,240
are gonna get my hands have completely
non-technical people

374
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,570
and the brick is great because its a
smaller version

375
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,960
love the Pelican pie which basically
just

376
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,500
you know you have YouTube hit the button
in the lights come on and it

377
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,220
communicates with colored lights what's
going on in

378
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,500
now we have a web server up but it also
is an Internet router

379
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,539
so we can communicate with this thing
through the cloud

380
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:14,650
and actually you know see what's going
on look at configuration logs we can

381
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,409
reflash it from the cloud

382
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:19,820
so the benefit at this one is if you're
going somewhere near putting it

383
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,970
somewhere and you don't ever wanna see
it again

384
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,429
could or you can't you can always you
know sort a call back in and get things

385
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:29,960
fixed whereas this is really great like
as a makers project we're gonna be in

386
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,760
and out and visiting them in

387
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,360
you know you can get in there and fix
things whereas this you know it once it

388
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,720
went to gets bricked that

389
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,549
200 bucks you could probably just buy
another one and put it in its place but

390
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:44,860
sir different variations on the same
theme but again it just pulls everything

391
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,940
together I think it's just a great
example the community coming together in

392
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,929
seeing all those different levels

393
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,370
really represented arm so thank you guys
for the work read it or perhaps am for

394
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,970
second if you have anything to say sam
za one that kinda start the ball rolling

395
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,590
with our prototype so special you guys
have any

396
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,789
very technical questions about these
setups he's a guy

397
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:07,360
said or thanks um will have a couple
minutes but

398
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,150
want there's a lot to talk about was the
Raspberry Pi itself the record pie that

399
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,240
we have here

400
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,320
it was great idea it's good prototype
and it works really well on the field

401
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,010
the problem is when it breaks

402
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,510
and that's the big issue we're dealing
with and that's why the brick is so

403
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,860
important right now

404
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,630
is because when this breaks and its 12
hours away in Kenya and it nears person

405
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,370
is Johnny or somebody else who has drive
there

406
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,090
spend a whole day getting their servicer
it doesn't work for us

407
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,580
so fun is something that we can remote
into fix on the fly

408
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,510
is money and that's gonna be huge for us
in the future and that's what we're

409
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,500
trying to do that's why we partnered
with brick

410
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,220
in trying to come up with a solution now
that not only takes the remote

411
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,610
capability that we have

412
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,900
but takes all the content and I she has
the ability to remote

413
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,390
upgrade and like john was talking about
the remote management is huge

414
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,720
it also gives a statistics to its really
nice for us to come here and go hey look

415
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,640
this is what we currently have in the
field or this is had this is the number

416
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,299
of users that we've serviced

417
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:06,150
orbit able to service over the last five
years and those are the types to

418
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,659
statistics at RB

419
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:11,380
huge for us and find out whether this is
really worth our while we wouldn't know

420
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,080
it is we believe it is

421
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,230
but shown it to other people having
numbers and having locations on a map in

422
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,270
saying this is where we're deploy this
is how far out jesse is gone because

423
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,110
I've you guys

424
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:26,309
is huge so thank you at this time to
take a few questions

425
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:33,309
short the backup go

426
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:41,370
right up so the brick

427
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,529
I am is USB powered you could yes
actually I'm

428
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:48,500
the question was regarding solar power
in being able to actually power the

429
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,200
Brechin how we're going to do that

430
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,870
yes this rugged pie does have the
ability cuz the solar charge controller

431
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,570
on it to take in a six-hole solar panel
in charge it

432
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,159
arm the brick doesn't have that but it
does have USB powered

433
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,659
up connection so that yes if you could
take

434
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:09,679
I'm the strategical solar cell situation
there is total solar panels on a mud hut

435
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,600
with the battery as long as you can take
that battery in the 12 ultram er done

436
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,360
five bolts or they have the ability to
which most the places do because most

437
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,980
them are using this trouble panels for
one for lights into for power cell

438
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,900
phones

439
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,270
the charge their cell phone so they
already have the five als most likely

440
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,659
that's not really gonna be an issue I
don't think we're more focused right now

441
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:29,710
on the product

442
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,950
there so many solar solutions out there
for Africa I think that's

443
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,190
thats up that's where to focus our
efforts yeah

444
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,220
also mention that's a really good point

445
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,659
the other thing I mention is that this
was designed in Kenya so it's exactly

446
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:43,950
where these guys are so

447
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,830
for it specifically for Kenya their
problems is very close to being able to

448
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,890
get it fixed

449
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:51,720
interesting story when these things are
being developed there was a rolling

450
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,539
a.m. power spike going through the
capital city of Kenya Nairobi

451
00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:00,100
and the course they're on 220 power and
the power company

452
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,679
got a couple their wires you know across
their however that works and the entire

453
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,929
city went to 400 bowls

454
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:11,340
you know mary a Merry Christmas we're
gonna double your power you know

455
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,919
you get the you pay the same price or
give you more and so in the middle %uh

456
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:17,549
designing this this they were below in
these things out

457
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:21,270
you know their prototypes so they they
fix the the power supplies on these

458
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,419
things to accept up to 400 volts

459
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:27,720
so everywhere from five to four hundred
should pretty much be okay

460
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,250
so were as I wouldn't plug this thing
into the wall in Kenya cuz I and i wanna

461
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,760
trying to be nice to it

462
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,090
this thing we can plug into wall power
or into like a cell phone charger

463
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,320
anything in between

464
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:46,320
which really helps a lot that's a good
question anybody else

465
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,350
I'll were

466
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,480
so the question is basically about the
geography and you know it the pictures

467
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,899
are showing in flat terrain

468
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:04,720
there's a there's a 3GS I'm a connector
here so you can put an antenna and and

469
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,649
the question

470
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:08,659
is how was I going to work in in those
environments and it's really a factor

471
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:11,380
what kinda mean tell you can you
collector

472
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,279
you know right out of the box I'm one of
the downfalls the brick is that it does

473
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,409
not have a wifi connector doesn't have
an external wifi connector

474
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:21,299
so cycle through wifi very far but the
3G connector

475
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:25,230
on s I'm a really lets you pull in a
signal from from very far away

476
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,899
so in terms a polling in that internet
signal let us get cloud coverage

477
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:32,630
you know any Ranger antennas powered on
powered all really boost this thing

478
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,450
significantly

479
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,640
Cohen art so we're actually got them

480
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,669
poll sign so we're gonna wrap this up
even more questions about the breaker

481
00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:44,730
hehe they have a booth upstairs

482
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,360
I will be walking around all weekend my
daughter's going home

483
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,659
so I do you have to shout out to these
people
