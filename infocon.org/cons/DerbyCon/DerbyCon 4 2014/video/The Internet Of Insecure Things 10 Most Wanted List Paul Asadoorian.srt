1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,549
day to hear me talk about this topic
which I love to talk about which

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:08,120
a good friend reminded me yesterday is a
que

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,710
so all this talk about the Internet of
Things is a good kinda validates what

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,080
you

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,099
you an hour talking about like five
years ago

6
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,960
my call at least one person remembers
nothing I'm looking for validation

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,000
again I'm just really excited that
everyone showing interest %uh

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,529
in came out today so thank you for that
up

9
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:31,029
so just a couple things about me I
always try to have fun with the about me

10
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:34,250
slide so I really brought this went down
to really short and sweet

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,430
right that's my work thing this is my
podcast thing

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,820
I enjoy things like that and I hacked
things

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,989
like that right next line okay

14
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,090
so the somethings about this
presentation

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,430
yeah I'm gonna see the internet if
things are not really super happy about

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,239
that term

17
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:56,489
I don't think it really quite capture as
well we're talking about

18
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,520
%uh today in in the fullest sense of the
word what this talk will not be about as

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,260
you're not gonna see me come up here

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,740
and hack into a device and say wow
that's really cool look at how horrible

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,530
it is

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,119
other two is to defend this well I don't
really know that's not the kinda talks

23
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,150
they like to give

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,310
although it is really wicked fun like we
say in Rhode Island

25
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,610
to hack into thing so I do have some
examples that I wanna share with you

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,320
because it's a really good example of
how an embedded devices bomb rebel

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,840
it's a really really funny story
involves russians

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,450
reverse engineering firm where its
awesome I'll

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,720
so also your the sky is not falling

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,350
because we have this problem yet however
I'm going to share with you predictions

31
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,950
unfortunately for me this will be
captured on the internet so I get to see

32
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,259
if my prediction comes true or not

33
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:49,640
but I do have some predictions as to
some the bad things that could happen

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,140
when we talk about the Internet of
Things so

35
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,880
it's more about real attack vectors and
I spent probably

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,340
way too much time thinking about this
topic %uh

37
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,200
you know what could we do with these
embedded systems I think it stems back

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,110
to my work for university and I would

39
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,300
you breaking the printer cinema cool
could someone do with that I was really

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,369
really curious in that

41
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,790
that curiosity never left me so I've
expanded it to you

42
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,510
the topic that will talk about today and
we're I'm gonna define for you

43
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,680
would I determined and even as an
embedded system in

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,330
you can say with your group that or not
but that's gonna help frame the

45
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,550
discussion for today

46
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,830
um understanding summer the different
types and applications and more

47
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,819
are also sold why the systems are
vulnerable

48
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,040
which I i think is really important and
I spent some time thinking and talking

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,959
to other really smart people about

50
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,430
how we're in the situation we're in
today hopefully that would give us some

51
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,480
insight as to how we can make it better

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,190
which is really what I want to spend
most the time talking about today

53
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,319
hopefully although if I have some time I
do have a little demo

54
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,940
about ripping apart some former because
it's fun up but i wanna talk more about

55
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,310
what we do about it in this

56
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,640
recommendation right these tips that I
have offer manufactures 'em invented

57
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,510
systems

58
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,340
but most importantly for all the viewers
well I want olive you to be armed with

59
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,440
the knowledge of what can we all do
better work in manufacturers do better

60
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,290
work and saw for developers do better

61
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,879
to help make this problem go away up
okay

62
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,879
so I found this definition for embedded
systems I searched for a really really

63
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:17,690
long time to find a good definition

64
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,140
and this was my favorite I do court the
research

65
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,170
%uh here as well in embedded system is a
special purpose system

66
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,040
in which the computer is completely
encapsulated by the device a controls

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,769
I think this definition nails it in this
is one of the criteria that

68
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,720
I put forth in my presentations in my
training for the types of systems that

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,810
we work with right

70
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,409
lots of examples of that you know I
universal remote

71
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,549
happens to be the same when I have in my
house right in other embedded system a

72
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,530
copy on the audience might recognize
rate that's a pony express

73
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,349
express public are three I in a sono
system

74
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,709
right they all fit his definition right
they fit the definition

75
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,420
up consumer devices that fit within this
definition

76
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,010
cars are you know there's like a whole
other subject enough itself

77
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,670
I would still say the cards fall within
the definition we will talk too much

78
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,250
about carjacking today

79
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,560
arm washer dryers toilets issue pointing
at the toy I really wanna hi-fi toilet

80
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,940
ahead and the ones they have had heated
seats in a spray you with water

81
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,490
and I really wanted to send a tweet so
all the view piano

82
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,509
exactly what's happening at all times I
think they'll be really

83
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:34,699
really cool I so yeah those are some
other devices I have in my home a of it

84
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:35,840
into my definition

85
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,870
your the nest thermostat being one of
them now with interesting about the nest

86
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,460
thermostat all the research that i've
seen has been made public

87
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,020
nothing has talked about every boat
attack for a nest thermostat

88
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,330
or attacked the former the things that
i've seen are

89
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,320
you don't plugging in all of this stop
and soldering things onto the nest

90
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,009
thermostat now I think that's really
cool to get me wrong

91
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:59,560
agree with respect to research the
people are doing with the nest

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,400
thermostat

93
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,509
however there was a post on The Daily
Dave less

94
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:07,770
M you know my good friend jericho I
think said it very very well he said you

95
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,289
know

96
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:11,340
these attacks agree however someone can
also

97
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,600
break into my house and smother me with
my pillow or

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,810
you know they can solder a buncha stuff
onto the nest thermostat

99
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,009
small when we talk about real world the
tax will be more real-world

100
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:28,759
the then this although I think that's
really cool

101
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,770
so I'll group sorry

102
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,930
okay so when did you kiss or preview
that

103
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,000
I usually don't put transitions I get my
presentation but I wanted to remind to

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,880
ask everyone

105
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,970
when do you think people started caring
about security

106
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:49,500
on their home computer systems does
anyone have a gas

107
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,710
ransomware right spyware adware porn

108
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,120
that you know everyone always twenty
asses question talks about the

109
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,569
florio porn popups right week this is
when people started carrying as when

110
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,020
their desktops look like this

111
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,400
right when they see that will lead to
see this from maybe they still see this

112
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,310
to this day

113
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,340
where they do oh my god I needed a virus
offer only got I have to call up

114
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,940
the first friend or family member that I
know

115
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,150
the nose anything about computers which
is probably

116
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,030
all of you in this room have been the
person on the other line on phone

117
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,460
um in make this go away because now i
cant get my porn

118
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,520
work well yep so

119
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,759
that's when people start to meet us was
a driver

120
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,690
for security right and I think a really
big one

121
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,900
I'll so this kind of trance states

122
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,389
to embedded systems hand

123
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,720
what's interesting for me is the movie
idiocracy really

124
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,560
influence the slide right because the
guys watching his favorite TV show

125
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,990
out my balls I mean is it's a call
classic

126
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,229
right we're not going to dispute the
however all around the screen

127
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:01,620
right are all these ads that are
permanently there in that got me

128
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,550
thinking we'll

129
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,419
people are gonna care about the security
of their TV

130
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,560
not what I stand up on stage in go look
at me I can hack into a TV in change the

131
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,210
firmware tallest up

132
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,590
they're gonna care when they're sitting
there watching their favorite TV show

133
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,020
how my ball

134
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,099
and this do

135
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:24,270
up but is this for me to step

136
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:29,270
lovingly turn pres thank you I love it
when you're gentle David

137
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,660
I'm thank you I I think

138
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,110
and mmm all

139
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:42,669
at mormon scrumptious com

140
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:46,680
so the day the people are gonna care is
when they're watching al my balls

141
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,039
in advertisements are coming up on your
screen right

142
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,849
because we all know attackers are
completely ethical would never put ads

143
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,660
on your devices to make money they would
never take advantage of all abilities

144
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,870
in his exploits on those devices to pop
up add to make money

145
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,849
because thats really not how the
computer or chrome works today at all

146
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,729
of course it is right out so ads could
be displayed it without

147
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,849
your permission and not just on your TV
but other devices as well

148
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:16,669
in that I believe is going to be some
the driver and we start to extrapolate

149
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:18,090
that out

150
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,610
this is a proof of concept refrigerator
that I found

151
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,330
now secretly I really really want one
right I I don't think they make the zone

152
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,780
is just like someone's ex catch the
dream idea

153
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,849
but just to give you your for the group
in the future so

154
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,399
you can see everything in your
refrigerator it's clear and then

155
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,360
this whole thing is a top surface so you
can inventory everything in your

156
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,640
refrigerator

157
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,600
this particular one will go on online
it'll help you do

158
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,160
recipes and it will then read you the
recipe

159
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,740
in tell you how to cook your meal like
without speaker

160
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,000
inside your kitchen interview
step-by-step instructions

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,630
%uh that was pretty cool but the thing
is now I've got this gigantic surface

162
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,880
with the thing about ads really comes in
right I mean

163
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,940
we're going to talk about some privacy
things that could be

164
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,370
the very interesting but from a sheer
perspective a caring about security

165
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,589
in actually pushing manufacturers to say
hey the consumer's going to care about

166
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:15,310
security

167
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,140
in the consumer's going to make
purchasing decisions may be based on

168
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,910
Basin Security these devices

169
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,560
or become really frustrated with your
product because if this

170
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,040
huge touch screen surface where ads
could exist

171
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,170
because as we all know which bull
established a little

172
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,740
later is that most embedded systems like
this are horribly

173
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,649
in secure okay so wilde's medicare

174
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:41,410
boat so what I can see you watching TV
right okay that may not be a big deal

175
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,580
but maybe I know what you eat and drink

176
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,920
or how often you do laundry when you
turn your lights on how long you spend

177
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,019
on the toilet

178
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:52,370
see for me you know that cuz you get a
tweet um which is nice convenient

179
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,130
up I in your I maybe I start to collect
all this data now it's one thing to have

180
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,320
this privacy violation but another thing
to cut

181
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,890
all this data in used to start sending
more targeted ads

182
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,880
now the thing was kind of interesting
for me is was so love these devices have

183
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,800
cameras

184
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,610
right that refrigerator I showed you
there are actual refrigerators on the

185
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,450
market today that you can buy

186
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,660
they have a camera inside the
refrigerator and you get a nap in your

187
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,700
smartphone

188
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,510
so that when you're at the arm the
shopping area in the

189
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,660
are supermarket you can look kinda side
refrigerator go yeah we really are low

190
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,620
on milk

191
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,180
and as Larry pointed out ever so
eloquently

192
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,240
now I can see the light really does go
all of

193
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,300
with shut the door that was like larry
is hoping with the camera inside the

194
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,390
refrigerator

195
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,010
is very good sick if I had that they'll
be awesome arm

196
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,040
so with that also brings a privacy
concerns

197
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,660
I'll so some someone was mentioned may
forget rule was

198
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,390
but this is you there was a a certain
kind of attack where if you collect this

199
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,220
data from the refrigerator about what
was in there you can identify

200
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,500
diet needs in also tie that to health
issues as well

201
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,190
which is also what kind of another spin
on that but when I'm more concerned

202
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,000
about

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,790
is that when I get a snack from the
refrigerator 3 a.m. I'm usually in my

204
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,630
underwear

205
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,790
okay Larry I know you don't wear pajamas
don't ask how I know that

206
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,000
but how does not wear pajamas and when
you open the door

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,450
like is the camera on the door is a
shining it you that there's a potential

208
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,579
privacy violation right there

209
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:25,040
I'll okay and up out but some of these
other things are really as well right

210
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,000
leg look at the size of the screen

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,980
on this washer/dryer right I'm it's as
big as my smartphone

212
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,320
again there could be another vehicle for
ad delivery and we talk about ransomware

213
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,990
we talk about adware spyware all that
kind of stuff

214
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,010
existing on these systems up the
interesting thing is

215
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,130
you know it ads aside I mean even if you
are getting in at Bright

216
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,290
we can see on our computers what's
happening on these devices

217
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,040
the user interface is almost often
removed right I don't have a mouse and

218
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,980
keyboard

219
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,519
on my washer and dryer to go into it you
know run a powershell script to do some

220
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,430
friends 6

221
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,680
I still have the washer dryer was
attacked in

222
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,920
arm so these devices I i think a really
easy for us to heighten our weather

223
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,089
might not be the most

224
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:13,570
high-powered systems they're going to be
targets from attackers

225
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,820
because up the ability to hide is a is

226
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,510
one of the things I like to point out
with people so why would you want to

227
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,279
hack into someones washer dryer now

228
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,670
white if vs could be prevented

229
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,389
right now we can't stop human stupidity
over what if this could be prevented

230
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:34,550
with some patches right I mean the
treadmills one of the interesting device

231
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,800
is my home

232
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,820
on that I have presented him before I
have found on abilities in it it does

233
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,089
run

234
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:42,750
Android arm but one day it said you
wanted update

235
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,860
Mike damn I got apply this update meh I
really don't want to but

236
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,850
I did you know I don't my wife doing
that because I didn't update my

237
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,889
treadmill

238
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:55,579
up also one of the things that I like to
point out that I don't necessarily

239
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:58,769
addressing my top 10 list in probably
his be adjusted

240
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,420
is right here I love you can see that
but it says hey in this

241
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,680
release we had some bug fixes

242
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,200
but wipe ok it would but what does that
mean

243
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,829
does that did you fix vulnerabilities
did you was there a spelling mistake

244
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,100
because there's a big difference between
a spelling mistake

245
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,570
and remote exploit up a lot of times a
better manufacturers to hide the fact

246
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,709
that they're fixing vulnerabilities in
these devices have seen a lot with

247
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:25,110
wireless routers as well

248
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,680
I suspect since this doesn't come up as
vulnerable

249
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,820
and write on my network any longer that
they actually did

250
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,240
update security patches and just talk
about Texas

251
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,290
okay well attackers will use the system
so monetize of course we've seen

252
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,449
a lot of examples in the news about
using them to mine pit coal mines in

253
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,510
bill botnets look it doesn't matter what
kind of system

254
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,800
you own to build a robot net as long as
I can do what you need to do in such a

255
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,709
botnet

256
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:55,420
you're good right and I think again it
comes down to that stealth issue

257
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,370
as to why people are choosing those also
there are some neck pure storage devices

258
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,279
that have more computing horsepower than
the system's I administered

259
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:08,160
when I started university about being a
Systems Administrator

260
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,230
I in that was like 10 years ago or
something so

261
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,019
the you know embedded systems are
getting much much faster more capable

262
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:20,490
so using them to build the botnet lost
some in the press will say well this is

263
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,120
ridiculous

264
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,310
i'm saying no this is a viable option it
can't do things like mining bitcoins

265
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,260
because I get maybe a larger or i
picking up botnet

266
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,149
to do the computations but it stays
there longer because people don't notice

267
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,040
that

268
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,310
their DVR or their security camera was
all

269
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,690
okay some the other classes attacks a
course industrial control systems all

270
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,269
spend a whole lot of time talking about
this for CMOS a big samples

271
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:50,329
the reason I'll I like this site has all
the seasons up here

272
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:53,740
have had a vulnerability that is
discoverable by nasa's which i think is

273
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,839
interesting

274
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,839
a lot of them are back doors and the
like him will talk about a specific

275
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,519
example later on

276
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,320
why do we care though mean let's dig
into

277
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,070
it's gone but you can see that image I
told you they'd get better

278
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,579
so the reason that we would care REIT
potentially life-threatening of course

279
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,620
with SCADA applications are industrial
control systems more accurately

280
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,980
I'm their historically operated on
clothes networks in this kinda leads

281
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,490
into my next point right

282
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,850
when you they designed the systems they
said wall

283
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,360
no one's gonna access them so let's just
make sure

284
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,490
that they work and that they don't blow
up

285
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,750
and then were good right never took into
account that

286
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,029
their network would be connected to
something up for people can access it

287
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,170
so economic still apply here know I've
done a series of interviews and security

288
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,199
we good people the live experience and

289
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,180
SCADA ICS embedded systems but they say
it in

290
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,380
economics applies here just as it
applies to the retail scenario

291
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,259
right onto the store I'm a rag regular
averaged user who wants a wireless

292
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:57,839
router

293
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,100
about the cheapest one industrial
systems are the same thing

294
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,449
cost is a huge factor one of the reasons
is you know these devices have to live

295
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:07,230
for a really long time

296
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,449
right in if they need to be replaced
they can't be spending that money

297
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:14,959
the running on tight budgets right that
think about the power company right

298
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,380
who'd you go to buy stuff that says to
you

299
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,519
look we want you to use less spent

300
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,600
less with us mean that's essential with
the power company is telling right

301
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,820
they want you to use less energy don't
spend as much money with us is that they

302
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,040
would fail miserably in the corporate
world

303
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,130
arm but you note so that applies to you

304
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,660
other economic summit um which which i
think is a huge issue for

305
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,029
these industrial control systems is they
want these devices to be

306
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:45,040
as cheap as possible

307
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,430
up in your corporations in your average
everyday corporation right there Hunza

308
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,070
embedded systems that are here

309
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,639
building entry environmental lighting
cameras we talk about skater rate

310
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,410
probably have a SCADA system in your
building if its newer

311
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,430
because that's what's controlling the
HVAC the lighting all that stuff hotel

312
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,589
key cards

313
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:06,429
headsets & Bones printers and
multifunction devices

314
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:10,500
we've seen all presentations on a lot of
these different technologies up here

315
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,079
so why do we care attackers will use
things as jumping-off points right we

316
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,880
know that we've always heard of that

317
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,299
but I that together with what I said
before is that these devices are

318
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:22,530
becoming much more powerful

319
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:27,209
in terms of CPU and RAM and storage
which makes them a more viable

320
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,940
jumping-off point before you know a
printer fifteen years ago probably not a

321
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,049
very good jumping-off point a
multifunction device today

322
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:38,900
probably pretty good jumping-off point
I'm in attackers will pray in these

323
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,299
weaknesses we've seen point of sale
systems

324
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,299
come under attack because it's a point
of weakness right is an embedded system

325
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,260
essentially I would classify some of
those -ism embedded systems for sure

326
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,840
although a lot of mine Windows XP under
the covers as we know

327
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,169
arm but not you know those are certainly
a weakness

328
00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:00,070
the attackers are gonna prey upon and
get into the system hopefully going

329
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,679
unnoticed because the user's

330
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,710
a point of sale system right %uh
processing transactions

331
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,980
not necessarily on their looking for
malware

332
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,179
I'll physical access is not a primary
concern or corporations unless we r

333
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,799
being specifically targeted right so
with the skate example

334
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,390
physical access probably pretty
important right I care so look inside or

335
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,740
something onto a device in

336
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,150
in blow up something in in the skating
world that's bad

337
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,520
are in our corporations probably much
less likely to occur although

338
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,919
targeted attacks about you could see
someone arm

339
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:36,320
bid taking over a device in a targeted
attack physically

340
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,179
arm of course the challenge of economics
all why we all fight over budget every

341
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,980
day

342
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,250
arm medical devices are interesting one
thing that's interesting is if you

343
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,500
google for

344
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,650
insulin pump it always comes up with
this picture

345
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,309
like whoever this model was is the model
for someone with diabetes who has an

346
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,390
insulin pump

347
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,049
which I don't think is always a 100
percent accurate

348
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:03,809
I maybe it's just me okay

349
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,780
but all these devices I V palms I mean
how many people who work in the

350
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,450
healthcare environment you know these
problems right a couple was in the

351
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,910
health care that want to admit it

352
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,900
are is hell you know these problems it's
bad

353
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,179
I'll there've been examples of a lot
research

354
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:24,919
up Elyria Rios and Terry McCorkle course
when they were at silence did a little

355
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,940
research into medical devices

356
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,640
in found that um there were critical

357
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,840
you know settings they could allow a
hard-coded passwords was the ability

358
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,230
and that's important if we can't I
believe bill is a car could pass for so

359
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,669
long as medical devices

360
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,730
and then we're going to look at summer
the hard coded stuff that I found in

361
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,789
some firmware

362
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:47,640
I'll that's kinda scary to me that we
have similar problems across all these

363
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,620
industries

364
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,169
okay why do we care what
life-threatening for sure right leg as a

365
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:54,030
patient

366
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,900
I don't want you getting into the I be
pumped to either not give me

367
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:02,030
enough or two much medication or
whenever the scenarios that you have

368
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,299
arm patient care will trump security
every time in healthcare scenario

369
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,419
right the ability love the caregivers to

370
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,100
make sure that people don't die trumps
how secure it is

371
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,340
which is going to be interesting as we
think I'm losing control the device

372
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,280
arm to an attacker as potentially
life-threatening situation

373
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,049
that does affect patient care but not an
everyday basis

374
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:28,549
arm in you know connectivity in is abuse
right

375
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,799
you know we don't want people to run in
this situation where I can give your

376
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,450
meds because I ve pump is updating
firmware

377
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,850
um that would be a bad situation so this
environment is very difficult to work in

378
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,900
I also think that patient
confidentiality

379
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,440
is probably second on the list rightly
make sure people don't die

380
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,000
and then make sure people's privacy are
protected and then maybe put some

381
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,500
security on things are typically how a
health care organization

382
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,370
lists out its priorities um then is more
important to be compliant

383
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,419
rather than secure in this environment

384
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:05,909
okay a lot of this is already happening
I wanna call into question this article

385
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:06,460
someone

386
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,640
called into question with me they say
that there was

387
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,390
%uh spam and phishing emails launch from
all kinds of Internet of Things

388
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,640
including televisions in the fridge if
you read the article there was one

389
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,980
refrigerator

390
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,210
but there's no data to back this up and
some people have

391
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,539
tried to get some data from this
particular organization have not

392
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:28,850
so I want to challenge you because we're
curious bunch

393
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:32,270
to help validate that if you can if you
know anyone there

394
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,659
I'd love to validate that data we've
seen this year lot of Internet worms

395
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,650
I run around when it runs into art
targeting home router set-top boxes a

396
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,409
lot of this is already happening

397
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:47,390
arm go not so much on the gaming
consoles though which is kind of

398
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,210
interesting

399
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,840
there is not a lot research about
someone breaking into an x-box or

400
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,409
we system and turning that into you you
know into a botnet

401
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:00,490
or doing any kind of attack that would
gain people money

402
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,360
doing ads I don't see a lot of evidence
if you do please

403
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,049
contact me um from what I found it's
just

404
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:11,530
highly theoretical I think that its
interesting

405
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,130
because the I computing power on

406
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,250
those systems is very very high rate
much higher than the average home router

407
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,950
in embedded system you'd find in a
refrigerator

408
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,549
but the the attacks that we've seen on a
very very low

409
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,870
so I think that's kind of interesting it
could be an opportunity for attackers

410
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,929
there

411
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,210
I'll so the this wired article

412
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,100
would when I just want to point out is
that if you see malware

413
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,429
in its targeting a low-powered ARM chip
or has a payload for low-power

414
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:44,669
arm checked chip its targeting embedded
systems

415
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:47,890
okay a most embedded systems on the arm
admits

416
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,500
architecture which for anyone has ever
done any debugging

417
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,520
knows that you have to go by licensed I
to probe the very few free options for

418
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,309
doing debugging on those platforms

419
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:02,260
arm but you know that's how we can see
that there are malware trends now

420
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,510
that are targeting embedded systems
because at the platform I

421
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,890
architecture okay

422
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,380
so I had to pick one example other bad
haircut

423
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,830
and one example I love embedded system
is really hardly vulnerable that I i

424
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,240
really want to

425
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,750
arm exemplify it would be the D Link DIR

426
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,539
100 okay in the knee with the stories
inside jewels back door

427
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,720
as the other reason I chose that is
because I got the call it

428
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,530
inside rolls back door in

429
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,169
up so little back route one of my heroes
Craig have heard a lot of research in

430
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,559
embedded systems is the author

431
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:44,730
up in walk published the original
advisory

432
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,299
that I will talk about you know also
talk about subsequent advisories

433
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,900
other people on this same firmware and
hardware platform

434
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,960
as you can see it's a complete
trainwreck um

435
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,900
Anderson references there I'm sack cut
lip is kind of interesting I took some

436
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,580
Zacks research that he did

437
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,500
and I planned it was on the other
research to create a really really bad

438
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,400
scenario

439
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,960
for this router um so it exemplifies

440
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,830
a lot of problem areas there are back
doors inside this from where they were

441
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,120
to fall credentials

442
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,450
their functions prone to overflows there
are secure

443
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,750
while in secure web management
interfaces

444
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,230
okay but this is alt kinda sorry

445
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:29,279
sorry Jack its up I'll just try to make
the point this is kinda alt Craig

446
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,590
families mall abilities in October of
2013

447
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,529
so um but bear with me cuz I got new
stuff that I found

448
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:41,299
like last week so a show that's kinda
fun up to reverse engineering this

449
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:44,850
firmware which is just every if you can
reverse engineer from where

450
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,890
get a whole this premier because it will
boost your confidence like no other

451
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,460
um stroll Craig finds a special compare

452
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,279
in the authentication process in his
compare that he found essentially says

453
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,620
that in programming language if your
user agent

454
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,320
is set to this string you can gain
access to the web interface

455
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,350
without authentication yeah

456
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,000
a look at selling for a moment up so
that means you can access the web

457
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,950
management interface without a password
using a special string the user agent

458
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,520
now

459
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,409
it turns into this user agent was
special as when it was reversed

460
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,679
with edit by 04 a tu Jo back door

461
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,169
so that's why we get to call the story
inside rolled back door

462
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:29,330
who is Joel anyway I never really found
out

463
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,610
II bread unlike some other forum that
there was a rumor that he was

464
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,960
in Taiwan it was someone working in
Taiwan

465
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,720
I don't know if anyone months that look
into that with me

466
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,630
I'd be happy to help has a I really
wanna final withdrawal is an ass cum

467
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:48,020
white dude why did this up causes bad

468
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,350
but a good friend Travis Goodspeed was
able to point out

469
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,690
why jolt may have done this so
essentially what that says was

470
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,240
0 that there was a developer one day
that had this problem

471
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,390
said Paul I got all these other
processes running inside this from where

472
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,299
in the these other processes they need
to change settings

473
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,620
inside the firmware and I got this this
really great

474
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,789
web interface in I just need to let
these other processes uses web interface

475
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:17,140
but the problem is to get the web
interface

476
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,700
they need to know the password in the
user can change the password

477
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,210
so were out to you is all just say that
if you set your username to this

478
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,830
you can access the web interface that we
all these other processes on the system

479
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,710
can access the web interface they don't
need me the stupid password who needs

480
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,450
that they've got a back door

481
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,090
in the user agent that way the user can
change the pass for all they want

482
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,730
and life is good no I'll

483
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,070
that was not a very cunning plan %uh

484
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,419
so Travis founded by the looking at some
the other

485
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:52,870
a binary there on the system in
recognizing a call to

486
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,340
this particular user agent now it
towards out

487
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,120
now what did the plot thickens now we
get to go to Russia

488
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,760
we are on this russian 404 we find

489
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,279
that in January so this Craig releases
research in October 2013

490
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,890
the russians founder on January 24th
2010

491
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:15,450
but they didn't quite know what to do
with it they were reverse engine this

492
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,159
from where they found this bout

493
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,460
and they were trying to use it as the
town that password because the ISP had

494
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,409
given them routers with this firmware

495
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,909
but not given them administrative access
to change any settings on it so they

496
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:28,480
were reverse ensuring the firmware

497
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,940
just the beginning access to the router
so they were trying as the town that

498
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,919
password

499
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,760
that's the last thing you see in this
forum posting

500
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,929
and then it stops so I don't know if
someone said

501
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:44,679
all this is wavy more than the town that
password

502
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,919
don't ever talk about this again so we
can take over the world

503
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,149
or if they gave up in just you know

504
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:54,010
we've done something else or they found
some other way into the router good lord

505
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,799
knows there's about a thousand other
possibilities in

506
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:02,140
okay the exploit is pretty simple right
i mean you can emulate this week W get

507
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:07,340
I've got a Dr 100 are or I could get a
tier one hundred actually

508
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,690
arm so but that's the exploit string

509
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,179
it some of these other devices so it
turns out that this firmware

510
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,370
was used a lot of other different
devices this DM

511
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,760
GP 5240 is a T Mobile branded

512
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,779
router oMG that was given out T Mobile
customers is also

513
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:29,399
some other ISP's which you'll see which
are using this router as well

514
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:32,980
so this particular device the GE

515
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,620
5240 yet to go to a different page to
authenticate to get the status

516
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,730
but that strings to work because the
firmware is essentially the same

517
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,029
soap this Jol in his infinite wisdom

518
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:47,100
introduced as but not just on the Dr 100
but

519
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,299
several other models are routers that
are still deployed today because

520
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:55,020
if you look on a certain website arm

521
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,340
their will tell you that are on

522
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,029
in the country's like I China

523
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:06,409
and Canada there from Cameron

524
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:11,539
yep excellent are so that this morning
really exist how do I know this

525
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:12,600
vulnerability exists

526
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,070
it's tied to the particular web server
the web server

527
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:19,330
is d httpd from alpha networks

528
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,899
okay now the plot thickens even more who
is out the networks alpha Networks is a

529
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:23,860
small company

530
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,940
they were acquired by d-link they were
doing stuff forum

531
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,059
like creating web service for embedded
systems likely we're told were to

532
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:32,580
introduce this bottle

533
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,480
fascinating I know but the systems are
still deployed today because this

534
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,600
version

535
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,909
up this web server ties back to this
version so

536
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:45,870
my guess is the ISP's in China and
Canada use this particular firmware on

537
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,679
their routers

538
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,289
because whatever reason and then the bug
was still introduced and still available

539
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,549
on the Internet okay so now

540
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:58,159
if you get someone to click on a link
you can send the authentication

541
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,799
to the router and potentially San
exploit to the router don't forget this

542
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,230
particular but describes as

543
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,070
access to the web interface to change
things right we want more we want

544
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,659
shell on the box to be able to upload
things and control it more

545
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,980
arm you could potentially do this

546
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,570
I haven't furthered my research in this
area however

547
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,640
I'll if you get a victim to load a
webpage

548
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,289
you get them to load up some code which
is able to send

549
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:28,510
a string to their router a request to
the router with the magic string set to

550
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,470
the user agent

551
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,250
you could log in and potentially give
yourself access toward change the web

552
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,020
configuration some way

553
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,120
um the problem is you have to bypass a
margin policy

554
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,450
and it's a whole the presentation in the
pits health the cell

555
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,559
are if you're interested in in how that
works come

556
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,669
finally after okay

557
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:51,130
but it turns out we really don't have to
go there arm

558
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,340
as you craig found that there is a
proper overflow

559
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,880
I so the pregnancy some exploit code
very quietly

560
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,100
didn't get a lot of bob is publicity
your CV surfer Dr 100 right

561
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,279
tons and tons of articles oh my god the
sky's falling the you dealing Dr 102

562
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:06,980
vocal

563
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,799
but you know there's like this little
tiny reference on Craigs site this is

564
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,840
all your by the way

565
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,000
a roller a remote exploit for that
platform ok wait a minute why

566
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,470
is anyone talking about that on it's
limited to 200 bytes shellcode

567
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,490
that's important for the next light so
commit that to memory

568
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,919
a bit requires administrator privileges
which thankfully

569
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,140
week we have because that previous poll
ability

570
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:34,470
right arm now the benefit is we can
upload an extra coat on the bus now

571
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,019
if you look at the web server so I if
you can type fast for dinner I reverse

572
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:42,419
engineer the firmware about the file
system alone on the filesystem I found

573
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:45,519
the web server binary which is called
web s

574
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,519
right I don't think the ass if it stood
for secure

575
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,690
be really really funny jokes they're
playing on us

576
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,850
but if you look for functions in there
um

577
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,360
because it's not stripped we can see
that the function and other calls

578
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,269
there's instances Ulster County an
aspirin death

579
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:06,679
Craigs buffer overflow was in aspirin
DEP

580
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:10,549
not actually inspire copy so there could
be in yet another proper overflow

581
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:11,330
vulnerability

582
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,970
in this web server in yes I did just

583
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,950
take you all back to like 1909 I was fun
right

584
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,200
%uh so now exact color brought some
awesome code

585
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,470
that some shellcode for MIPS platforms

586
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,110
that runs in the context of Linex his
show code

587
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:35,690
is 100% 84 bytes how many bytes did we
have to play with from the previous I'd

588
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,950
I'm glad dropping attention thank you so
that means

589
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,380
you can take crags exploit was just as a
payload in there that

590
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,450
I think it restarts the web interface
for something like that is cracks

591
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,140
payload

592
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,090
I'll Zacks payload is much more evil is
actually a dropper payload

593
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,700
so the multi-stage so it puts a
multi-stage Palin there so that you can

594
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,330
get shell

595
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,830
on the box it does that within a hundred
84 bytes which is awesome to put those

596
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,730
two together

597
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,730
you can on the router okay at I'll

598
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,200
so when I have more time I'd you can
play a route that on your own to need

599
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,649
help come find me

600
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:15,179
um it's a lot of fun I didn't get the
actual exploit to work you gotta run in

601
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:16,429
emulation or have that

602
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:19,880
exact device the device I have is
different so you have that

603
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,779
changing parameters in the exploit to
make it work I can make a crash reliably

604
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:25,100
which is kinda fun

605
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,230
um but yeah you can paste all that
together anyway

606
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,730
it's not dead yet there's even more
because in December of 2013

607
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,500
rights we start in October 2013 russians
founded January in 2010

608
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,830
now December 2013 Felix writer exposed
to several more

609
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,890
motor bill is affecting Dr 100 routers
including cross-site scripting

610
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,029
in a whole bunch of other stuff up how

611
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:51,500
staggering okay now

612
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,080
paul asked Dorian for this talk count
that

613
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,590
on the system there is a file I think it

614
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,669
what is it called all ass Parnell da Pam

615
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:05,250
like a that's kind of interesting I
wonder what's in that pile

616
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,990
it turns out that inside this but I
really have a drink track just so you

617
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,220
know I don't forget to drink by warming

618
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,250
course light meaning and

619
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,649
mmm so not good

620
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:22,560
um so at I it was looking at this biogas
I had mounted the file system in it does

621
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,290
is difficult but is also a private key

622
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:28,679
I like what does anyone see the what's
the problem

623
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,429
with that did just yaki reuse right

624
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,889
this is the inside the firmware this
means every device that ship with this

625
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:36,679
firmware

626
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,690
is also shipped with this private key
which means all the private key is for

627
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,050
all the T Mobile routers are all the
same

628
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,409
it also means then I have the private
key for all the T Mobile Router

629
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,869
sheep kind of interesting

630
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:54,820
out so that was like an additional ice

631
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,800
I I see you back there so let's

632
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,960
re Dave just what is that is that is

633
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,010
white-hot to do is that in your

634
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,150
armpit

635
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,310
I know I did

636
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,180
could it's like

637
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:22,990
warming nasty

638
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,900
mmm arm okay so they want to recap

639
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,589
the vulnerabilities are the Dr 100 being

640
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:37,430
mmm of being

641
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:42,780
a of God

642
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,780
yes disgusting thanks David

643
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,750
love you up so yeah has lotsa ball
ability is

644
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,470
authentication bypass %uh CSR up and
also

645
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,880
on the static use that I talked about
really really bad

646
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,369
okay if you go to d-link site

647
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:03,500
it and I

648
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,960
it would be re-set up Brazil is that

649
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,720
that right Brazil I dealing site in
Brazil

650
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,450
up is running in emulation of this from
where

651
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,599
from 2007 around the time that it was
vulnerable so this firmware version

652
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,700
would be vulnerable

653
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,980
it's running on their site so I'm not
encouraging anyone to do that

654
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,119
I just thought it was interesting good

655
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,780
that they were running that yeah

656
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,849
okay next fight so hurt

657
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:38,640
um but now Paul the conditions right
what you're saying to yourself now is

658
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,980
the conditions that you found

659
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,270
and all these other people found anne's
you know home routers in

660
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,830
in all the stuff they just can't exist
on all these are the platforms that we

661
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,690
talked about

662
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,950
except for the research that's up there
on that slide

663
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,250
right now the dole in

664
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:59,160
okay well thats next but of in there are
more tax very quickly issue more found

665
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,790
several flaws in the ex-works

666
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,800
I have been discovered DNS rebinding
which is very interesting to read about

667
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,650
as well

668
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:09,349
arm there are some up now are created
for Nintendo Wii and DS systems were

669
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:10,730
doing that research in there

670
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,490
live course the famous ATM account the
ATM packing

671
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,310
I'll but anyway so those kinda their
future reference

672
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:23,650
a hot style now you're asking yourself

673
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,619
why well now you have the answer to why

674
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:30,760
fucking cat tears apart toilet paper

675
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,930
now you have that answer your welcome
but now iraq has a

676
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,619
why are embedded systems left on the
cold when it comes to security your

677
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:41,930
right um so

678
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,480
this couple things here most products

679
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,450
or dip anything you're designing for
people to use

680
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:56,450
is designed with you the

681
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,040
in

682
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,820
long shari are

683
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,920
in

684
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,050
while makes it really hard talking okay

685
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,230
at the pinnacle the slide to says

686
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,960
dresses really good issue pay pensioners
so

687
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,420
every product is designed with two
things in mind right

688
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,079
is the product usable in this case as a
hammer

689
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,480
right does or when I put up a TV break

690
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,750
okay so whatever so use billy wright L
my TV turns on

691
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,849
doesn't change channels display an image
right

692
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:51,480
it's also designed for reliability the
TV doesn't explode

693
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,160
under normal operating conditions that
right there is not

694
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,380
normal got something absecon larry's
backyard

695
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:04,109
not normal operating conditions so make
sure that you can use it as its intended

696
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:09,230
and that the shit doesn't blow all up
what are they not designing for

697
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,359
right what happens

698
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,640
if an external user takes control love
the system

699
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,560
it does bad things within right this is
how we get into the

700
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,270
skated devices that are people taking
over your televisions were

701
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,800
routers are whatever they're not
designing them

702
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,890
is it any evil actor or bad guy were to
take these over

703
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,130
in make those devices do bad things
outside the normal specification

704
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:40,510
right you wouldn't do I have yet you
wouldn't do this with a hammer

705
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,660
right like with a hammer I make sure

706
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,510
the compound stuff usability right I
make sure

707
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,970
that when this someone's using the
hammer I design the head doesn't come

708
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,260
flying off and crack someone else in the
Skoll

709
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,950
when I don't put any design thought into
when I make a hammer

710
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,119
is making sure that I prevent someone
from picking up the hammer and start

711
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,829
bashing in people's kneecaps

712
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:06,150
I can't design for that right up but
here

713
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,619
with digital devices it's kind of like a
digital camera

714
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:13,430
we have to take into account that people
will

715
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:18,280
use these devices to do evil things
because they're connected

716
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,200
in this is a whole new aspect to all the
things in its kinda scary

717
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,930
because as things in our own homes in
our corporations as those things die

718
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:31,180
casa look over my shoulder for David as
those things die

719
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,460
or need to be replaced are replacing
them with newfangled things

720
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,190
that have come activity that have these
problems so this problem is going to get

721
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:43,700
exponentially worse all rights we fix it
so what do we do about it up

722
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:49,960
let that slide sink in

723
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,170
up in

724
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:59,930
so I came up with this list the things
fortunately being a stripper is not

725
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:00,770
harmless

726
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:04,590
fortune for love you but their the ten
most wanted list

727
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:09,420
right and these are somewhat tactical
you become a role somalis up in grouping

728
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,500
together

729
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,310
it put a higher level labels on them for

730
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,000
I for for management but design
engineers 10 to 100

731
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,310
lower level so these the 10 things that
I caught up with

732
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,350
is 10 enough I don't owe is 10 too many

733
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:29,670
I I don't know i'd I'd appreciate your
help on this issue have more suggestions

734
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,010
more than happy to talk about pearl up

735
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,810
so the first thing that we have this
firmware back doors a secret account or

736
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,600
access created by the vendor that allows
remote management right

737
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,530
the problem is is never so secret
because as you can see I can easily rip

738
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:43,910
apart

739
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:47,210
firmware in get into that and see the
secret things that they put it

740
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:50,870
that's happened a lot of also if your
back door

741
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,200
that your securing is secure for the mac
Address

742
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,050
that everyone can see the network is not
so secured

743
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:03,470
RuggedCom okay default credentials are
different from back door sprite is the

744
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,950
credentials at the user sees

745
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:08,360
a course these credentials are
everywhere the

746
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,680
zombies ahead of course was the ability
that road signs right

747
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,150
you had to pick a lock it had to know
that the fall password in a course as we

748
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,060
all know anyone can discover that
password

749
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,100
now the scary part is sometimes with you

750
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,800
update the firmware it restores these
default passwords

751
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,500
so they get put back that just begs the
whole question um

752
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,630
vulnerability in configuration
management making sure that this up

753
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,560
doesn't come back

754
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,380
in secure remote management

755
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,540
let that slide sink into for those good

756
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,330
hair pic a good password

757
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,060
right but not so much speaking good
password let's move on

758
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,210
the struggle how we manage the system's
over HTTP

759
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,360
over to how men what are the first
things I do when I get a nasa scanner

760
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,160
is I go into the town that results this
is on a trip to telnet server

761
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,220
and has a severity of low a change
that's over to the high

762
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,490
I wanna know about that okay out but
we're still using a lot of these

763
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,430
protocols

764
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:14,880
on these embedded systems open source
drivers have been this is an issue that

765
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,130
we dealt with in 2007 we wrote the book
on Linksys routers

766
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:23,290
that manufacturers up these chips right
proprietary drivers

767
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:27,170
for wireless for Ethernet for a whole
host of things they give us is binary

768
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,100
blobs

769
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,950
in a look at this should work with most
versions a Linux but then

770
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,340
there's lotsa problems with that i cant
I can't you can't unless you work for

771
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,190
Broadcom

772
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,240
in all the developer about binary blob
you can't fix problems that are in that

773
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,810
code you have to wait for the
manufacture to fix it

774
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:48,190
you also if I wanna do something in my
platform in my firmware

775
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:53,840
that maybe makes it more secure but I'm
held back because I got the binary blob

776
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,960
and it's not let me move forward because
I can change the binary blobs to the

777
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,560
public blob a binary code

778
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,190
so open source drivers definitely

779
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,230
I think will contribute to better
security for functions prone to overflow

780
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,300
like we all know star copy is bad

781
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,670
apparently our developers don't know the
store copy is bad

782
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:16,110
it was a star copy but that read led to
some other IP my firmware

783
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,140
vulnerabilities

784
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,310
I'll so my suggestion is to really
educate me

785
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,210
the programmers in really hit them on a
level that I think that they would

786
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,800
understand

787
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,150
with posters that you post your
workplace

788
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:35,400
all my friends are using store copy but
I'm not because I understand how

789
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,730
dangerous it is

790
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,140
puts a peer pressure on the developers

791
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,990
in I respect myself that's why I refuse
to use aspirin

792
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:49,990
debt in

793
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:53,550
biggest forget aspirin tab exclamation
point

794
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,220
her alright encryption there's a couple
things about encryption

795
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,360
for am sorry to have the funniest live
from that for that

796
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,380
its been have been challenged by my
coworker space wrote the make sure all

797
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,100
my slides are

798
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,040
funny and he would make fun of me for
that up but for work which is important

799
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,760
0 signing firmware updates makes it
harder to put a back door in the

800
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,970
existing former I think that's probably
the most important thing you know

801
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,520
encrypting for over so we can't reverse
engineer it

802
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,460
is probably gonna met with mixed success
because we're just to try and break the

803
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,250
encryption

804
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:28,520
arm but signing firmware updates sowwy
Microsoft signs

805
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,770
on you know Microsoft Update I i think
is important for things like former

806
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,580
largely largely does not exist across
embedded systems

807
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,230
former updates are now there's no way to
validate them most times

808
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,520
in also X or is obviously not encryption
mixes tried to implement some

809
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,920
interesting for wearing Christian
algorithms

810
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,740
um that are very good or really without
contribution

811
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:56,330
user-friendly updates right even when
you talk to your average everyday user

812
00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:00,420
a day going to want to say well I need
to update my friend to download that

813
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,310
farm where i mean you have no idea what
firmware is

814
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:06,990
we want the firmware update process the
ability to update these devices to be

815
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,160
very easy

816
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,200
now I think on the smartphones and
tablets

817
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,520
that's a good a pretty good model to
follow it sometimes forces users to

818
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,180
update

819
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,880
which can be bad my phone says I'm
updating you anyway

820
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,140
um and then wrecks my phone or does
something bad to my phone

821
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,460
I'll I i still think it's something we
need to strive for

822
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,640
okay secure web frameworks

823
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,940
one of the reasons you know I use that
example the d-link Dr 100

824
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,980
is it really example has a problem in
embedded systems

825
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:43,750
these systems are so small in limited by
space in CPU and RAM

826
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,380
that you can't just take input Python or
dotnet

827
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,560
or I any other web technology that's

828
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,290
proven dare I say PHP no I want a PHP

829
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:57,800
but et you know a web technology
framework

830
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,640
that has some security built into it you
can't put that a lot of these devices

831
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,310
just because the space in CPU and RAM
requirements

832
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:10,840
so what developers do just like when
encryption isn't available to them

833
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,430
they write their own the results a
pretty much the same

834
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,830
is a flaming piece of crap as we saw
with the web server

835
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:22,350
there was put on the other router but
the problem is with that

836
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:26,470
the people like to reuse it so they'll
say well that person already spent the

837
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:29,300
time to piece together this whole web
server thing where I can change your

838
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,130
configuration when we gonna rebuild it

839
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,420
are just reuse it in all these other
firmwares and always alert devices

840
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,600
that's why we see the Dr Deir 100
problem

841
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,990
being propagated to all those other
systems

842
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:45,760
that's a prime example code reuse so we
really need some kinda

843
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,470
secure web framework that works

844
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:54,050
on a good majority have embedded systems
a lot of the systems are a linux-based

845
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:58,530
I believe we can come up with that a
nice framework for doing that

846
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:02,070
you busy box is a standard platform for
putting binaries

847
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,960
in you can do utilities on the system's
I hope that we can come up with a

848
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,180
standard platform

849
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,710
for web applications as well

850
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,200
okay um so maintain a star you know I
think that

851
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,200
I'll various vendors over time have

852
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,570
got kinda mixed results um and

853
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,570
links is actually responded or Cisco

854
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,710
what now it's Belkin who bought link sis

855
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,900
any is a Belkin Cisco and then

856
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,870
I think you're talking to sell it to
someone else as well it's like the past

857
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,830
stepchild no one wants it

858
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,370
soho I said is so but in this transition

859
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:43,400
my Lynx's web sites to download old
versions a firmware

860
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,390
went away and I said can you put those
back in the league what firmware you're

861
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,230
looking for

862
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:51,470
mcguire Illini this version firmware
what do you need that why I need to do

863
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,860
security research

864
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:57,060
and then I never heard back do it you
can put a ticket in over here Mike of

865
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,190
other so helpful this is so great and
then I put a ticket in

866
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:03,300
and I never got that they sent me like
the latest firmware

867
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:06,680
you can't go back to do any kind of
security research barreling

868
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,590
so I'll anyway I'll

869
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:14,190
its is so important to work with
researchers to get this done

870
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,310
you know present got hacked in the P the
research for money

871
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:21,730
and wrote a nice blog post I'm which was
nice so they're clearly different ways

872
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,270
tree researchers

873
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:27,370
a we need to be able to work with that
community as well

874
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:31,090
secure protocols on a lot of these
different systems you I look a mess so

875
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:34,520
no system I look at a lot of the
Consumer Care has these protocols

876
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,520
put a lot of protocols exist like back
net in

877
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,970
a building control systems for
corporations they all kinda fall into

878
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,370
the same category

879
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:46,150
mod bus for SCADA right there's no
security

880
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,740
in any of these protocols non whatsoever
so

881
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,260
her I really think that we need to
rethink what protocols are being

882
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,020
implemented at these devices

883
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,920
a bill security into them and
standardize on

884
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,920
I would do not type

885
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,470
if ten minutes okay up with that

886
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:09,140
maybe I have time for well I'll take
questions how about that

887
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,820
I will I want to show you a demo will
take questions yes

888
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:19,740
I'll

889
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,200
in

890
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,810
all in

891
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:34,810
up in

892
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,700
yeah so the question was that a lot of
the vendors about him

893
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,520
been factors IT devices they put the
onus is security on the user

894
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,070
and how do we change that I think we
really need to engage the user

895
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,460
to call out security thats Sox in making
a driver

896
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,740
for spending and then they'll stop
putting the onus on the end-user which

897
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,650
never works

898
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,770
is are taking some ownership oven

899
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:08,770
yes question up

900
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:15,890
in

901
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:22,890
up

902
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:30,760
in

903
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:35,830
yeah so the question is at what point
are manufacturers responsible

904
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:39,120
for the warranty and the longevity of
the device

905
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,760
in supporting that device yeah I mean is
a great question I know the answer is

906
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,070
probably gonna defer

907
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,500
I know what I would like to see is a
consumer I don't know is economically

908
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,750
feasible from the vendor

909
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:52,500
right I legacy by paula version a
product to your gonna and the life that

910
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,920
five years from now

911
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,450
I want at least some discount to the
latest model

912
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:01,890
arm or some credit towards the latest
model if in fact the vulnerability lives

913
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:03,860
inside at the hardware like i cant

914
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:08,210
patch that hole ability either because
is a harder the imitation or because

915
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:11,380
we're just not supporting the firmware
anymore up

916
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:15,710
I also like to encourage manufacturers
to choose firmware and hardware

917
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:19,640
that they can support for a long time
but the problem is economics come into

918
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,340
play

919
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,450
and the local we just want the cheapest
ones we can beat out the competition

920
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,960
and that's where you get the stroller
with if you look at all the different

921
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,290
hardware platforms for just Linksys
routers

922
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:34,310
there's tons in that's why throw ish
looking for the cheaper solution

923
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,740
so to be cheap

924
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,740
okay ago that's time

925
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,450
I'll be around all day and night so
prime if you have more questions but

926
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:44,880
thank you
