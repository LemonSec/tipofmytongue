1
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,410
right I know a lot of people say this
but I'm

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,160
I'm really knows but public speaking so
I'll try to avoid eye contact

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,400
amp but thank you all for coming

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,740
the title over talking with gone in 60
minutes

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,590
a practical approach to hacking and
sprayed with your sOooo and if you are

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,180
the two lead for you it's

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,910
I'm and we'll talk about it invited if
you get time

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,660
I'm practice get sad though

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,980
I am sorry up it's called its pronounce
author of 100

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,890
and I I look at the director of security
said its security companies

11
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,370
create a pen test company based out of
China Canada

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,040
um in my day-to-day job I do

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,530
pen testing on and this is what I love
doing in San an excellent at the contest

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,890
on getting two min admonition is an
added bonus

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,230
to the job I'm I started off with over
the engineers that but always

16
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,309
have at had a secret crush in reverse
engineering I'm

17
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:03,930
and I'm a Jew treat with bad eating
habits

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,659
an adequate to beauty products so

19
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,010
and Steven Hall as you can see not

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,979
much is known about me like to keep it
that way my workouts are up

21
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:19,900
when I don't get on his nerves too much
and I am fortunate forgot my Santa hat

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,259
so you can also see me in Toronto
walking the streets in the middle of

23
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:24,810
June

24
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,970
in a santa hat bank though I wanted to
set the record straight that

25
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,820
with the you are now at this table talk
about not going to be dropping any other

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,159
day there won't be any says

27
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,820
a.m. but something more important than I
showed if that make sense

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,750
and so it said if the nail

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,259
so you are on the red team engagement
are you actually trying to break into a

30
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,030
company you are in a city there

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,380
and you bypass physical security

32
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,409
which is somebody the to you unless you
have to those ties are nato dating does

33
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,649
its front page pretty much TV to buy
possible security

34
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:06,780
you bypass knack for some 15 test out
the kinds that they implement

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,200
network access control I'm does not have
a the bipartisan acecomm

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,390
the gyroscope this talk but from Mikes
be at the most common one is to just

37
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,050
look for unprotected not coached

38
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,629
if you see a router hanging from the
roof arm

39
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:23,860
are lying down on the floor yeah that
the moment

40
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,959
up about two to three miles and

41
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,040
right what next though what are you
going to do after that are you going to

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,840
run our liberties Canon

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,060
that's probably a bad idea pick at

44
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,300
ok I

45
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,690
because it then if I double any rift
added

46
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,709
all your all the net to forget the
device is a slight a bad like a

47
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:45,410
Christmas tree

48
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,150
step and a are if they're the Vigilant
network admin

49
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,230
that but there is a catch you for share
so the problem at hand is that

50
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,290
thereby possibly the six physical
security they bypassed Nakamoto extract

51
00:02:59,290 --> 00:02:59,920
data

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,709
from the network and to it as quickly as
possible and get out of the net

53
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:08,569
get out of the premises up but we can't
under 1mb scan it because it's too noisy

54
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:09,330
tho

55
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,459
panetta today creates Canada basin so
200,000 the request

56
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,190
I'll we have to be stealthy and quick

57
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,540
I'm iffy but on external network we
could use Google Docs ohtake sites

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,180
blink in URL to find specific
applications thank

59
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,170
and then I am go that route but we can't
do that on indians

60
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,290
internal network so

61
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,599
may do show that come from and that
thing was to play the part

62
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,720
me so a wise man that I used to work for
it I think it was real true love telling

63
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,879
when said there's not a boat what it's
about bed and

64
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,220
death insist that with increasing
security awareness

65
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,750
and to Lebanese security to manage that
all the network devices are becoming

66
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,620
spotter

67
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,920
and because up increasing awareness on
it but Apple admins hours to becoming

68
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,689
proactive

69
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:03,010
I know lot of time the conference me

70
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,140
me moan about how bad the security if
but that things are improving

71
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,959
and for you would find lesser time the
network devices being

72
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,370
now configured in a secure manner and
began to really difficult if if a

73
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,190
network admin if you're dealing with a
net admin who knows his job

74
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,550
becomes difficult to bypass after
thirteen states

75
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,610
I'll so the key is to find that

76
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,570
11 members there were are a service open
poet an application that can let UN

77
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,310
and unfortunately when few went to get
access one-time

78
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,240
it becomes very easy to paper two
machines are compromised by the system's

79
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,320
to gain further access so

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,340
where do you find these weaknesses who
doesn't love tom cat

81
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,669
nobody wouldn't have a target on the net

82
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,960
to relief requested

83
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,870
crew doesn't like a boss

84
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,919
how many people know about goods and
Jenkins

85
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,910
one 23 so Hudson Jenkins's

86
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,370
pretty much bill automation tool they
were nice enough

87
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,680
in building this service to

88
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,070
give you a shell access by default

89
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,430
with the script consul so

90
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,020
in the top top screenshot is from Hudson
Jenkins

91
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,370
it lets you run groovy scripts which is

92
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,169
Java pretty much so it gives you this

93
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:43,289
shell by default that you can run
whatever job you want into it

94
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:47,400
what is not to love about this

95
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,070
still we wrote yesil

96
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,180
what it is its a ruby script

97
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,069
that scans for vulnerable third-party
applications

98
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,419
it's not a vulnerability scanner we
don't actively gloat

99
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:07,620
we're not like missus and be safe K I
love this stuff is a problem

100
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,039
we look for applications I have no
issues

101
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,800
and exploits we support

102
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,110
most if not all of the web application
stuff

103
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,569
from Metasploit so we scanned for URL's
that show

104
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:26,850
that these applications exist on this
server

105
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,150
which gives you a pretty much

106
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,900
a starting point for where you want to
look

107
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,960
why did you write why did you write this
so if you look at exploited be there's

108
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,160
about 12,000

109
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,770
but different exploits on therefore tell
if I

110
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,610
are five promo code execution file
upload SQL injection

111
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,259
stuff that can give you shells

112
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,069
and the best you the common application

113
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:00,220
that we just talked about chavis by to
Tomcat

114
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,500
damage on sale actions in I mean
everyone has a different style a pen

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,550
test but

116
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,990
the Dunham was common application I do
not make me happy

117
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,910
that you like by doping test it but

118
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,430
very anti these are not the only
application they i time the weather

119
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,520
that's kinda that he said that out there

120
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,729
so I can barely remember to look for the
top five

121
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:27,319
I can't remember much less 10 does can
anybody in her

122
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,150
remember that much so X

123
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,699
up we're hiring would you like to yep

124
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:37,750
yep so the thought process behind this
was

125
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,590
it's kind of the way to say hey I can
remember all of this

126
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,599
I need something that can for me so

127
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:50,020
we decided to go about and write this a
Ruby told to do this

128
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,210
i know i know: sign be getting it away

129
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,780
I know did poet on me here with on
tonight

130
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,830
be definitely did not play tonight I
think we spent a good amount of time

131
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,740
writing that

132
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,580
code is still crappy but we spent a good
amount of time writing this thing

133
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,190
we we encountered books that we didn't
know existed in various protocols that

134
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,949
amazing

135
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:15,650
so up what we used to do before

136
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,849
and everybody knows that all the stuff
runs on like 8080

137
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:23,639
or 8,000 so unless you to skip to do
this yourself you go around you poke

138
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,599
manually

139
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,990
and shown a large network that can take

140
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,470
far too much time so recently we're on
an assessment

141
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,190
where we scanned 5,000 hosts

142
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,610
with Nessus that took about 24 hours to
complete

143
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,519
from start to finish we ran

144
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,029
or two against their entire range of
about 26,000 hosts

145
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:53,620
and it finished in two hours we found a
boat

146
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,120
2525 so we thought about 25 instances of
stuff on the network

147
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,480
that we could easily gain access to we
did

148
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,970
we got domain admin enterprise admin
from there

149
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,240
and we call it a night went home very
happy

150
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,500
delivered a report and

151
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,930
I slept peacefully knowing that I have
shells everywhere

152
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,830
so what's currently out there

153
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,130
the stuff up there it does some stuffs
similarly

154
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,540
but this is more select our tool is more
geared towards

155
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,589
finding stuff that has known
vulnerabilities in their it's more

156
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:34,290
targeted

157
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,140
to stuff that is an exploit DB as well
as

158
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:44,760
Metasploit 3 trying to create something
which was very targeted to urge

159
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,170
finding on able to gauge when have an
application for a step

160
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,089
for whom they exploit already out there
the Kansas by it that you feel can just

161
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:52,649
find

162
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:56,209
the applications and we can just go and
exploited

163
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:00,600
we don't support exploitation I'm and I
suppose maybe viewpoint to put

164
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,570
expectation

165
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,820
beget the problem is because the full
expectation for the application so

166
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,810
who is exploited that in minutes but but
that other exploits and

167
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,529
on exploit EB and I don't know if I
trust

168
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:18,910
on a temp so it won't device gonna our
behalf to just execute as

169
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,779
that particular exploit up the there's I
loved it

170
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:26,899
Fitch options that are provided by your
so on

171
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:30,290
so their stash F actually decide the
dash are stupid

172
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,980
using dash are you can collided up IP
address or IP to a screamer this

173
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,160
the standards format that and map takes

174
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,490
if you don't want to see it through a
tooth ken I'm you can

175
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,180
you can candy network do it puts can
using and map

176
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,940
and adjust if there is a in XML formats

177
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,990
and then feed that fight Chu to use to
love it dash athletes

178
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,250
I'm and then on other cities I sent it
to and map to be done use action and

179
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,649
method you use axe and map night british

180
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:05,810
with me also for the dash are we also
support

181
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,550
input list similar though the way and
not

182
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,980
the newly separated values go a bash
beef which

183
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,399
it could force and im if you choose to
brute force they perform

184
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,070
form-based authentication so for example
I find application and

185
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,769
8 protected Betty Ford a weak prospects
and you want to root first that

186
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,519
say too good for that for you beat fund
is a vindication or

187
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,579
STP basic are typically attribute first
bought the damn

188
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:38,930
so if you choose and Ashby form it'll
only brought forth

189
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,829
application bitshare came back wit
phone-based authentication

190
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:46,310
with SDP basic 82 routers basic
authentication

191
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,980
sense that bird so I was working on my
flight deck I was ovitz making this flow

192
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,810
chart and mr. you think they're the
PowerPoint

193
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,310
and does she teach you to know that and
my life walked past me behind me and see

194
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,990
that you know that looks like a really
shitty

195
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,720
for a shot hand I'd I told her why did
you do it at the she came up with this

196
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,519
man down

197
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,880
I'm sorry if you can read it but I did
not have the boys removed from

198
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,880
from my flight ek have

199
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,510
so the Floyd night if you if you provide
Ashar 3/8

200
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,850
with boat photo I P range RM I P

201
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,930
IP address then sits stock the in maps
can you can map a breeze

202
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,970
now if you play dash F and and the file
on

203
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,350
which from disk and that you already
perform it to

204
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,950
intake that file stock pot thing that
fine

205
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,209
and then it looks were open so

206
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:42,279
open ports open that this post so as to
DPS DPS

207
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,529
supr to their best and so on and so
forth look at all those boats

208
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:51,040
after that it creates a preemie you out
as the protocol IP address and port

209
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,220
number

210
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,630
then it's actually adding the default
path stock see if the file and we'll

211
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,620
talk about it file in a while

212
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,139
I'm and socks leading defile application
part one at a time

213
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,060
in this appears the final URL start
sending out the Kress

214
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,470
see what the response up it's from the
server and based on that

215
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,500
if it comes with two hundred and it
looks far

216
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,860
if they're the login form and then it
dynamically extract

217
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,990
the lockdown the login farm he's an
imposter parameters sent out a request

218
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,889
and to see you if that one of the
default password exist or not

219
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:27,940
yard dog crate if it's not and it at the
same farm

220
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,540
love basic STP basic authentication

221
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,149
if if it doesn't find any basically I'm
net4 to be clubbin trenches and it moves

222
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:43,389
on to next part and then on to the next
port

223
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,510
what's in the box I'm so when you
download if there's good

224
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,649
I'm you will find you feel which is the
main ruby script

225
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,990
then there's a response to 100 job it's
basically deals thread the form-based

226
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,149
authentication

227
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:00,850
I'll hundred-person this t4 patter see
if we would have the key file it

228
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,670
contains all the signatures

229
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,829
and also contains the Pats 21 exploits

230
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:11,550
associated with that particular
application I'm use this to txt pastor

231
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,389
txt

232
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,779
contains have a basic list if he's an
imposter X

233
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,029
I'm it depends what you want to put
pressure on

234
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,810
ideally I would want to keep the fish
are pretty can either provide your own

235
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,860
you the names and passwords in there

236
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,380
and up to this is what I'll defied
patootie if if I look like

237
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,850
for that the first real is def iPad
application

238
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,519
the second feel as they exploit in
minutes rights for that particular

239
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,779
application

240
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:42,980
and the best buddy that we tried to make
it really simple for you can add your

241
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,139
own Pat

242
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:47,350
and leone exploits the format it's just
simple

243
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,310
I'm if you want to be really really
stead amp and you do them rekon

244
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,320
beforehand

245
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,209
so take when I go on a pen test I'm the
V keep a job that particular companies

246
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,290
the most important is to me because I X

247
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,820
is this excessive build without any
authentication you start digging

248
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,100
see what kind of applications install
would kind of the pic manages to these

249
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,360
companies use

250
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,560
and then you can just remove all the
applications from the list and then

251
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,769
target like a couple of applications are
tutsi applications and find a network

252
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:21,899
random cat picture good

253
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,089
have what's happening behind the scenes
at that

254
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:30,310
it detects was posted so I'm if you come
across one of those leftovers that sent

255
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,899
two hundred a4a one back

256
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,459
far each and every garbage find that
request

257
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:39,089
and so so what we need to do if we
create a book with by

258
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:43,329
and I think it is called bogus fight now
and it's it thanks to requests to the

259
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:44,779
cell with that filename

260
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,740
and if if he gets two hundred or 4 2010
dirty to take back

261
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,769
then be discard that particular part
addendum to the miniscule chance that

262
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,560
she may be missing alleged an
application but I didn't want to get

263
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,769
into that

264
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:02,660
at this point in time I'm it also
automatically extract the login

265
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,389
fun and once it finds the login form to
automatically extract

266
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:10,620
up the username and password fields and
sent a request

267
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,579
to the seller arrest

268
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:18,740
temple

269
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,529
civil in

270
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,529
we have hopefully sacrificed enough to
the devil got Lord

271
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:31,470
not there's here he you think a comment

272
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:38,120
let me think me

273
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,750
alright on

274
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,800
okay that did not come out right would
befit

275
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,730
I did not initially looks like with all
the options

276
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,449
this is not a virgin Cedar Point mines
that we had this idea be created a

277
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:55,519
prototype

278
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,899
there's a long list a feature that we
need to implement and

279
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:05,899
hopefully we will implement in

280
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,819
so for the paper the demo already
performed a post anything and map and

281
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,049
see if the output file an exam and
format

282
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:19,730
which I'm going to use but missed him

283
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,020
so I'm using dash be switched to
brute-force of the beach on base or St

284
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,770
Pete

285
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,960
basic art it's better to screw put
everything

286
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,010
and crash no sending

287
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,070
they'd found an application called
fabric and now it's beautiful thing

288
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,620
login credentials at this point of time

289
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,240
be

290
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,970
like we said like the username and
password lists and application list

291
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,980
can be we to

292
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,230
match whatever technologies are using
their so the request

293
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:03,230
will among request you sell will be a
lot less

294
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,340
fun couple of other applications that
meet epic application

295
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,450
I am then it found tom cat

296
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,710
I think talking is just there by default
I think sometimes

297
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,190
it automatically in stores that sell
them I've seen it so many times on the

298
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,910
network I I don't think people in
started deliberately I think it just

299
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,120
comes up somehow

300
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:34,840
and there that be getting caught testing

301
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,310
other love you I think it's largely used
to

302
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:44,580
to remote code execution as they in the
end it to display a list

303
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,720
ap kit be still working on the table so
and yeah

304
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,090
ya that make tables and Ruby are without
using the gym

305
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,940
it's actually surprisingly difficult I
maybe we just don't know I could be

306
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,500
any with out said the first feel if the

307
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,630
the application that it found up the
second feel if they exploit associated

308
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,550
with that particular application in
Metasploit the continual

309
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,690
that exploit after this and the third
field and forceful

310
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:18,690
a default username and passwords I'll
the for the first application

311
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,620
someone said the strong possibly did not
find DBQ the name and password

312
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,540
up but the second application actually

313
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,400
if he if you scroll up its eighth note
indicates shootin'

314
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,230
the first application because I think
they did not find the credentials

315
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,390
per second application fee look here
eighty

316
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:42,350
eighth the login page not found let's
make this instance

317
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,720
his senses on it indicates a actually
that pace if not implement

318
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,170
a username and password so you get
access to it and not indicated

319
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,420
I'll for the third one they get again

320
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,970
phone form-based authentication and
starts to shorten that

321
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,850
and find the password admin you the name
admin and the password as password

322
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:07,570
and finally Tomcat Tomcat and testing

323
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,160
this is that guy I couldn't have makeup
a huge interest sector to

324
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,930
for demo but I like I said we did
against 26,000 IP addresses ripon

325
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,470
when to stop um and just got to me an
admin to show

326
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,780
in light PR system yet

327
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,440
me

328
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,760
the summer the Chinese would be a
fitting for initial even may be studied

329
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,880
writing that be tight

330
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,980
yeah I agree with that but also to other
applications

331
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,380
but exploit BB the crate research but

332
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,290
I'll the entries are not consistent the
which the application name

333
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,470
the version number application name

334
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,780
Brett two brackets and it was number are
there's no application name sometimes

335
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,560
there was a number I just application in
a large number though it's not that easy

336
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,380
to park

337
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,190
ha sitting out soon yeah so a

338
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,840
actually try to parse split EP 4

339
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,360
application name and the URL and
unfortunately

340
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,660
unlike Metasploit they don't have a very
standard format across

341
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,520
anything so trying to programmatically
bill that out

342
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,010
is a nightmare so we'll

343
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,770
unfortunately be resorting to the
greater nightmare both doing this

344
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,460
manually

345
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,770
unless anybody has any cool ideas that
they want to talk to us afterwards that

346
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:33,250
might help so I think we we analyze and
then you could practically extracted up

347
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,770
for

348
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,990
around 6,000 entries and for remaining
phyto then we'll have to hire interns

349
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:45,200
I'm the other challenges that too many
to extract the

350
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,240
the login form automatically and then
you the name and password

351
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,110
abt its always it on Hulu based on the
red X pattern rhinestone

352
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,910
if the pager then French are any other
language stand

353
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:02,830
at be doomed basically and to be treated
basically a white going to Paris for any

354
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,770
pen tester

355
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:09,020
think that beast staining US I

356
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,610
a future development up be very real
implement worst mother was in detection

357
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,640
I am weeklies we think not

358
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,130
adding support for mass can begin with
it's the it's very

359
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,200
in the states to scan the internet and
then they already scanner those out dead

360
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,690
and it would be just convenient if he
had been mapped I'm ask an output file

361
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,260
split getting Ds too early to start
finding minimal applications

362
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,160
and harass them meanwhile over again

363
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,490
act support for obviously more whenever
applications I am

364
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,400
add a second signatures to put them up
to very common file or directory names

365
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,300
like PHP

366
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,840
last login or PHP its rage anorexia we
want

367
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,200
want to add a second re signature so
that's be

368
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,380
actually find what you want to find and
not from divested up

369
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,160
I'll make the code is really crappy
night

370
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,560
up you can have a look at it so it's
good but it's deliberate I'm afraid if

371
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,730
you open the file it may break Sep

372
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,130
in attract will try to admit it
spreading to the thing and

373
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,360
was the so scanning the 26,000 IP
addresses

374
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,690
in two hours was on a single thread

375
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,220
so yet

376
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,390
I maybe maybe we will result to

377
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,800
going to 3 feet instead of exploiting
the big cap repeated often research it

378
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,610
it's the Liberty aggregators store the
data and my secret database

379
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,980
the maybe to be there to to fetch from
there

380
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,820
I maybe not I'm any conditions

381
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:46,460
Arnott's

382
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,059
sick yep

383
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,489
a

384
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:57,659
no not that stupid on a time now day I'm

385
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:01,700
Dean only see a lot of threes can only
see a lot of for non STP

386
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,769
but about cool

387
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:08,940
absolutely after a dental applications

388
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,200
that right

389
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,690
up

390
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,570
so it did not treating it a device and
certainly felt

391
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,379
the kind to lift that I know you have to
scan fight on IP for and

392
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:31,470
that's okay I know you would have to run
efforts but Monday when can you try and

393
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,049
see

394
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,909
if you can do something as and so that
the network admin stone pick it up

395
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:40,940
and we did not hear back from the
network admins for that night's

396
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,700
hey we are certainly other than a cat on

397
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,480
make a cut down version I wish to be 2.2
put all the username and password

398
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,169
be only cap like admin admin admin blank
a 2003 Honda nations that's it

399
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:58,690
hard up

400
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,909
absolutely

401
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:07,029
it death the you can prove a soap you
can either use task I'm switchin provide

402
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,980
an IP range

403
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,429
and it to perform in oppose can you can
specify port 8080 whatever

404
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:17,009
number board members I M if you don't
want to do that you can do your own in

405
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:17,749
maps can

406
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,399
export the output in XML format and then
feed that fight to

407
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:26,799
to the tool and to take it from there
your

408
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,859
word yep

409
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:35,549
I unassigned be in not getting owned
part can do using and map library

410
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:41,009
to do that yet know it you can grab the
code from there

411
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:44,629
and we're out of time right though

412
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:49,249
yeah you can download the code from the
ghetto I will try to keep it

413
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:53,549
updated I'm Leggett said that the long
list a feature that we need two billion

414
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:58,460
and so will continue working on it you
can contact us for any

415
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,980
additional feature it fast as you have
them smart idea I'm

416
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,619
I'm sure you do I'm if you do however
want if any abuse

417
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:09,730
are any complaints about this thing then
up this Steven and go to H

418
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,499
and then the perfectly logical email ID
is perfect for that thing
