take that on sale again alright and a
and whiskey that traditional

9
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:15,180
so just an introduction to you

10
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,989
so you're gonna do year the goal is to
provide meaningful information about

11
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:19,769
testing in

12
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,609
in virtualized environments what your
options are I'm

13
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:26,939
to show you that is easily attainable to
set up an environment the

14
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,019
test in and I am and

15
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,849
for some reason it this this basic level
the talk is

16
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,189
usually often overlooked and and I don't
know why

17
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:42,680
but this talk was actually initially
presented it abolitionists digital

18
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,400
evidence

19
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,790
at Marshall University on and

20
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,979
persons because year after year they
kept asking

21
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,269
how I even get started like what I do
get into this because

22
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,290
I can do showed and to those kinda legal

23
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,150
and you know I I don't know really where
to get started so that's

24
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,989
that's who this was initially geared for
and on and so

25
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,189
there's that disclaimer I

26
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:11,930
I have modified severely so there will
be a few names

27
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,720
I am and that's hopefully they keep you
guys awake this early in the morning

28
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,849
on that being said this is not no date
of

29
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:25,210
alright there's no advance that was a
serious thing like that is going to be

30
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,419
taking place years

31
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,520
that's what you're looking for you
should tell you see it illegitimate

32
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,930
into the though the web's days go check
out the other guys stop

33
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,650
this is a this is an introductory talk
is is to get you started in a

34
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,780
virtualized environment

35
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,120
hopefully everyone will be able to take
something away from it but is not

36
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,440
not advanced exploiting now sexy reading
top okay

37
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,800
on this is this how to get started I am

38
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
I'm the proponent the path of least
resistance

39
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,729
so there are multiple multiple ways you
this everyone has a favorite

40
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,889
I'm but the way that we're gonna go is
is the way to chosen because

41
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,469
easiest document easiest to be able to
replicate

42
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:07,479
easiest for you guys stay calm and be
able to said

43
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,320
the set up in your own environment okay
so

44
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,050
quick role-playing and and that the one
smiling right now

45
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,330
that's now you're thinking I am you've
been fired

46
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,650
okay you're now getting back into the
industry to be able to you

47
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,889
J retain known planet or you're just
trying to get into the industry

48
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,419
I am an you're probably gonna go through
the interview process several times

49
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:38,349
while the questions you have the AST is
what are you doing

50
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:42,430
to either maintain or increase your
relevant skills

51
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,779
what are you doing to make sure that you
are and keeping yourself

52
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,760
relevant and and knowing how technology
is work

53
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,539
I'm you have an answer to that you know
what you the answers that type

54
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,150
question you'd be dull then then this
talk

55
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,770
should should help you because everyone
should have a desire to learn if you're

56
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,460
in the MC

57
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,130
every security shield I'm their only
reason I'm here is because I'm addicted

58
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,810
to learning

59
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:14,229
and this is a great feel for that so
hopefully everyone hears

60
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:18,669
year the same way on canister employment
not only have a degree wrote

61
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,050
certifications also

62
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,719
possess a true working knowledge the
letters article says

63
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:30,199
is what is needed in today's environment
see people all the time they have great

64
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,620
certifications

65
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,630
because they're good at taking tests and
they've got all kinds of

66
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,120
a degrees I am as a good at taking tests
that what

67
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,060
what the f a sec community right now
needs are people who understand the

68
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,610
underlying technologies

69
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,389
can can make it work so what can we do
to be able to

70
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:52,110
to fix that work what can we do to you
actually

71
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,829
turn that tied and and get people into
feels that that matter

72
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:00,529
that have that desire to learn on

73
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:03,659
and and 10 those is is

74
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,969
making sure that you are doing your part
to

75
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,539
increase your skill set I not everything
you're gonna see

76
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,610
in a sense course for you know in

77
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,820
and some training is gonna be the
holistic

78
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,860
picture you have to do your own you have
to you have to show your own desire in

79
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,060
and and get out there and and learn the
other pieces other make it work

80
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,360
I'm you have to do it you just have to
get out and do it so

81
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,089
I've got to gots change that but

82
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:37,599
there's a reason article well was not
the reason I guess it's been

83
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,000
3-4 months ago si ESO I am

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,339
salsa hackers room the they understand
it's the

85
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,240
you know the the people that matter to
people that are charged hiring

86
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,089
understand is the No

87
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:54,529
that people that are driven on their own
are better than those that

88
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:58,079
artist good at learning had I am

89
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,769
goes on their cybersecurity defend a
better way hackers on governments

90
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:02,370
worldwide

91
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,190
upping the consequences am for flouting
rigorous security standards

92
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,419
on goes on to say was it what it takes
to be good hacker

93
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,390
going to be really good at hacking at
work and learn work and learn

94
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,099
her all your times on keyboard right and
and how many others

95
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:23,399
is that case hopefully I get quite a few
hands right so that's the way we should

96
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,419
be

97
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:29,219
I am but you know it's it handed

98
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,610
you know it demeanor and in some places
but

99
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,409
on and others I i've been n not so much

100
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,320
on he goes on to say you know other a
spear programs

101
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,169
I may have you had gone for an offensive
security course

102
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,529
guy icp-oes the

103
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:51,209
great courses that security guys he says
you're basically that

104
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,920
these guys don't compromise there'd
their models try harder

105
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,079
if you want something is going to
challenge you and and really get you

106
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:58,950
into the

107
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,990
into the field at I recommend the

108
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,740
the event security courses as well and
I'm and that they will definitely

109
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,389
challenging

110
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:12,060
how can you get there practice practice
practice

111
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,279
and how can you get that practice well
hopefully you don't know park in this

112
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,560
parking lot

113
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,579
on but that could happen I am

114
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:23,050
what we want to do is we want to set up
a virtual lab we wanted

115
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,230
we want to do this legitimately right we
want to do it ethically so let's

116
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,529
what set up a virtual lab and and

117
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:33,519
the cost is lower game and there are
many open-source

118
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,320
solutions out there we're gonna cover a
few those

119
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,190
I'll provide all the resources and
everything you need to be able to find

120
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,209
them on your own

121
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,600
um the slide deck is already been
uploaded now have the

122
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,110
the lead to that on the on one final
slides

123
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,980
see daughter were not taken pictures all
the links Inc and everything else okay

124
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,769
Lori be out there for you go up or down
himself

125
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:01,200
Maytals as in distributions are out
there virtual machines

126
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,690
are the primary medium and you can
download I sister caliber you can also

127
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,180
download the end you can download ices
for

128
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,269
for dat in cane and some the forensics

129
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,190
you can also download a min the ends the
ends are are certain to become more and

130
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,610
more

131
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,160
the way that people should be there
their tool sets

132
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,029
and given as broad as information
security is

133
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:26,680
you need understanding how it works um

134
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,620
but a wide you know why Brian volatile
environments are also available

135
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,360
so say your task however you're ready
merserve in testers

136
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,540
K Hwy um how many have you are

137
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,870
forensics type books for want to get
into forensics rating

138
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,230
how many have you are blue seamers right
to

139
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,470
good mix crown there something out

140
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,820
one II know that in in the past

141
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,860
you know I did didn't have any
experience

142
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,220
and testing a SIP environment so wanna
do you

143
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,540
I went out and I found in Laurel sippin
Virant VM

144
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,220
have voted up and learn how to contest
the

145
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,370
afforded it brought Raisman julie is a
better I didn't want to take down fraud

146
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,100
but those %uh those are the kinda use
cases we had

147
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,390
another reason everything is going
virtual

148
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,540
when you look at bed you know

149
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,960
at the way things are going greener
environment there

150
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,110
they're all going where virtual so I

151
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,529
if you're not testing yourself in a
virtual environment you're not hurting

152
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:34,620
yourself in what's

153
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,800
what's coming up and and what's actually
being implemented data centers now

154
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,880
so quick definition the terms for those
that are not aware

155
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,570
on and yes I will be rooting for the
slides for these for just a little bit

156
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,380
I will try to try to make sure everyone
understand basic terms before we head on

157
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,940
the hypervisor is a virtual machine
monitor as generally a piece

158
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,570
computer software firmware hardware the
create some runs virtual machines

159
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,070
I can hear on which high risers running
is defined at the host machine

160
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,160
virtual machines around this hose are
for to get

161
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,270
jeans I'm a virtual machine

162
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,140
for those that don't know is they
suffered a simulation Ave computer

163
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,270
and it will I am ill generally operate
on

164
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,290
on based on architecture functions are
the real computer

165
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,000
yet the tele how much harder is facing
you want to have allocated to

166
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,660
how much RAM you I had allocated how
many CPU cores you want to have it out

167
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,050
allocated to it snapshot love

168
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,300
I am preserves the state and and the

169
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,330
and and a virtual machine including

170
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,580
you pretty much everything related to it
at that point I'm

171
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,370
at all the data stored in RAM old is to
run this

172
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,920
it just snapshots in is not necessarily

173
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,250
you know like it selfie its more her
have a situation where

174
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,130
you are your creating a I restore point
you can come back to you

175
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,290
wire those valuable and virtualization

176
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,130
yes exactly right so

177
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,120
if you have a lad there's a harbor
Lavigne you screw up one of those boxes

178
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,270
it takes a couple hours to get it back
up and running rake virtualization you

179
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,700
can have that snapshot it

180
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,670
hit a button refer back to that they
make our lives much easier

181
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,230
so is much easier to learn so

182
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,780
three different ways that networking is
generally configured with then

183
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,620
I within a virtual machine our bridge
that goes on me

184
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,410
I each one is is configured in a
specific way

185
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,760
bridge will basically as says that binds

186
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,500
the virtual network adapter directly to
the physical Ethernet adapter

187
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,980
VMworld and %eh least from the physical
network so

188
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,680
it will look like you have to separate
systems on that on that network

189
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,240
right knack is is network address
translation

190
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,270
it buys virtual network adapter behind
the night environment

191
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,660
I am contains a DH internal the HTTP
address

192
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,880
shares physical you can add adapters
public IP address

193
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,350
for external communication so just like
your

194
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,690
your home wireless router you you have
an internal

195
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,120
I P E address begins to communicate
internally and externally

196
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,420
host only is behind NAT but you had no
you're answering dress

197
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,640
with an hour okay so you get an internal
network communication

198
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,270
only the issue he leases taine you can I
get out alright

199
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,750
so let's get into the technical how
we're gonna set this up

200
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,950
we're gonna we're gonna have a a Cheryl
structure

201
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,589
relook at Harbor considerations were you
I think I'll you can need

202
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:41,030
30 set up an environment like this look
at different virtualization platforms

203
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,280
that you may want to utilize

204
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,060
and then we're gonna set up a VMware
ESXi server

205
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,410
okay offensive and forensics
distributions will look at a few of

206
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,089
those

207
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:54,400
and using some links to those on

208
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,820
I know Muslim probably play with you
those on the list

209
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,690
their callous a row the BCS that set on

210
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,829
look at some virtual appliances and look
at some

211
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:08,420
a virtual distributer bottle this
region's

212
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,530
that will %uh they'll help you test
missed a little to no us

213
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,740
things that's or alright so

214
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,640
I were considerations and this system is
what all this is going to be running on

215
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,720
today and we will

216
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,810
hopefully do a live demo we'll see how
that goes rage

217
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,730
but um while while the CPU speeds do
matter that's one of the things that

218
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,760
always asks

219
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,780
I'll you when when someone's wanna set
something up how much CPU to any

220
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,490
they really don't matter as much as RAM

221
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,319
and and I'm and hard drive space

222
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:46,490
right hypervisors are pretty much all
memory of their son they're much better

223
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,640
than others

224
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,459
hypervisors are generally all Marriott's
there they're going to you

225
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:54,970
require a lot of I'm a lot of RAM

226
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:00,240
I am the VM's written a very drastically
in size you can get very very small

227
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,390
you know like the SL install an ex or
you can go all the way up to having a

228
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,750
you know went as a pawn 1 the end that
takes 28

229
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,380
hard drive space just for the core OS
rates

230
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,480
so you can need a very very drastically
in size

231
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,390
and so that said that'd big
consideration

232
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,440
station power supply to you you don't
wanna melt anything down

233
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,569
alright so virtualization platforms

234
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,770
%uh some the onesie for another my
virtualization platform that everything

235
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,250
you'll be seeing on

236
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,959
is running on today is is running on top
a VMware Fusion

237
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,970
K um VMware Player

238
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,650
workstation run Windows and Mac her
windows and 1x

239
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,870
I'm yes I try and yes I X

240
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,890
are argued server environments ESXi
eating get with the community

241
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,940
license though yachts pay anything
toward news presentation purposes

242
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,160
parallels is another one that people
generally like dat running on a Mac so

243
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,310
I am there are strong camps in either
direction

244
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,870
I don't wanna argue about how that how
that goes in which one is better than

245
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,360
the other but

246
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,630
they both have their advantages and
disadvantages Oracle VirtualBox is a is

247
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,069
a good

248
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:15,810
open source I am option for you as well

249
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:20,669
its cross-platform crosswalks is another
great one

250
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,240
and you can you can do a lot of love
virtualization with Ed

251
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,560
and with less hardware is better on
memory

252
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,820
and so to get one

253
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,310
XenServer is another one that they may
learn to also consider

254
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,410
pretty much all these out there are

255
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,010
are free or at least you you

256
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,340
did VMware Fusion VMware Workstation

257
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,090
parallels you're gonna pay for those
rate the rest these

258
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,300
I am you can you can pretty much I get
with

259
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,580
error and ESXi server address these you
can you can get

260
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,900
fairly cheap you just have to register
pitcher pitcher

261
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,020
product key in and register that

262
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,280
now all inclusive there are many many
other options and

263
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,510
Red Hat they're all has a different
virtualization platforms

264
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,300
but what we're going to cover here is is
primarily things that you guys can

265
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,210
attain

266
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,350
get trilogy okay

267
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,669
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
ahead and set up an ESXi server

268
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:26,159
were gonna do on Maria said ESXi
hypervisor

269
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:29,679
on top of the world fusion on this
MacBook Pro

270
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,740
and the system specs on the system our
core i7

271
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,650
to get yours 16 gigs RAM 500 hard drive

272
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,860
and the am ESXi again as pre for
educational purposes

273
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,110
so anyone let down so what we're gonna
do use we're gonna

274
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,659
we pull down the VMware ESXi I so image

275
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:53,800
on and that is on the host system

276
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,990
and we're gonna create a new virtual
machine for VMware

277
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,130
on top a VMware Fusion said the ESXi

278
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,560
I so as the boot media for the new VM
that we just created

279
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,280
and then on you know just so you know

280
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,530
this is this demonstration purposes only
please

281
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,390
please do not take I love this room that
I want to set up an ESXi server on top

282
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:17,919
of using

283
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,100
okay and go home and do it

284
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,050
on bare metal okay it's like stacking
chairs

285
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,290
when you could use the latter it's not
really a fission

286
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,570
does not really effective but it works
good for demo purposes so that's why

287
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,500
we're doing here

288
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,750
I don't wanna try to have to get outta
networking get into it external system

289
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,090
and we know everything's been hidden the
network recently so

290
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,520
that's why we're doing it this way but
you can set this up on

291
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,320
on bare metal home set up the server you
have the and running all time

292
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,460
they can be things for your lab or they
can be things that actually serve a

293
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,300
purpose within your environment once you
start seeing all the options that are

294
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,200
out there

295
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,790
you may you may find some things are
useful for your home

296
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,570
environment that that actually you know
you can run which

297
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,940
so we're getting some screenshots okay
gonna take a little bit

298
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,490
do to go through this if we just
installed in

299
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,690
during the during the time we have here
so I'm already gone through that process

300
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,700
this is what is ours looking not only
boot up

301
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,060
we're going to continue going for him

302
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,080
and more connected enter to accept and
get it

303
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,280
f11 here to get into you except the

304
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,780
the default but if he had at 11 on your
Mac insiders

305
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,390
VMware's just gonna laugh at you so you
have to you

306
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,490
escape out and use the menu got a
virtual machine

307
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,540
saying he f11 metaphor you on national

308
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,960
so discuss can through a look at the
heart where you can see right there that

309
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,590
delegated a hundred days

310
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,300
my father I get hard drive see you that
specific

311
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,560
VM said the US default

312
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,240
set my re password yes

313
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,340
ok

314
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,330
so this is a hundred cakes I'll

315
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,020
space on my physical 500 gig drive

316
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,120
but its actual selling it with them
VMware Fusion

317
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,220
yet

318
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,570
there so its segments it outright and
its bonds a little files

319
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:34,070
but I'll but yes as a 100 gigs of space
that I can I realize for anything else

320
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,679
alright service at the root password
guess the scanning again

321
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,500
it then once the valley again that I do
want to you format this drive

322
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,050
so we're good go through the menu system
again hit f11

323
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:51,020
and installs hmm then tell you that you
need to remove the CD-rom

324
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,260
from that from the system for jury duty
again

325
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,149
you wanna go back out to the menu and go
dance year

326
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:01,639
under the bridge from Chi Minh you get
your CD UTI who

327
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:04,970
Moore drive and then tell the disconnect
that

328
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,830
and then hit enter redo takes a little
while to back up

329
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:15,679
want to get slow to back up it gives you
greater on the screen the IP

330
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,700
to reconnecting T okay so guide he's
right there

331
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,730
scratch it down because well you have a
running anyway but he

332
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,040
scratching down cuz you're gonna need at
a little bit to connect back to it

333
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,600
alright so ESXi management I'm

334
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,370
one my my polices that I am

335
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,429
there's a the one problem I have with
ESXi

336
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:44,200
is that it requires a a Windows backline
manager

337
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,480
I'm not big on running Windows
semi-retirement but

338
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,679
this is one of the options here so I'll
need another physical box

339
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,070
if I can set up a BM that's when does to
manage my

340
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,590
p.m. hypervisor okay so like

341
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,929
again its in wanna see inception

342
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:06,179
been pressure will get into a little bit

343
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,860
here ISO um the ESXi

344
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,940
management out once we get in there I am

345
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,610
you was going on

346
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,190
all my pictures are gone lol anyway so a

347
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,610
we're yeah we've gone through this part
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna

348
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,260
set up

349
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,030
a Windows 8 VM with VMware vSphere
Client

350
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,740
and then the VMware vCenter Converter
stand-alone

351
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,220
and and those we'll on help us manage
that

352
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,909
on this will this be our management the
end this VM again is sitting

353
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:47,710
on top love are be more fusion
environment

354
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,960
K his outsider outside the hypervisor

355
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,230
because it has managed a hypervisor all
the VM's or setting up

356
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,560
are in an added environment so they are

357
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,159
a broken communicate outside but they're
behind and that

358
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:05,830
because we're gonna have a virtual
machines in here I don't want them on

359
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,700
the edge

360
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,210
and Andrew people attacking workstations
with than mine

361
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,230
you know guess work sessions with the
machine so makes restin added if you go

362
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:15,880
bridge

363
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,880
gonna open yourself up

364
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,050
um I wish all my means were shown up
there be much funnier

365
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,440
a race so further operations are gonna
set up where were

366
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,290
go ahead and setting up the win as a
pawn 1 I so enraged from the magma pros

367
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,590
hardware

368
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,940
on Grand create a new virtual machine
within VMware Fusion

369
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,440
and then we're good said that a plan
when I so as do media for the VMware

370
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,360
and server we're getting beat that up

371
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,070
and so when he more screenshots

372
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,120
alright so here we go were set up
Windows

373
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,139
is all pretty had asked us how much hard
drive space we want so

374
00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:01,620
I am goes through the process

375
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,210
VMware Fusion works really well with
Windows it'll reputed

376
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,149
once it comes back up it on a clean
install VMware Tools forest

377
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:13,260
is awesome say just that and a reboot
again

378
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,040
and you get a bad back to you on being
able to login

379
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,860
so not a fan right but we have to do it
for this environment

380
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,870
so we can we set that up what I'm doing
here

381
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,220
is I've got the an excusable

382
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,690
for the mister client on my core

383
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,909
magma pro and I'm gonna drag that over
that stop this one is a pun on the end

384
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:40,659
that we just set up

385
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:44,110
copies n because of the Immortals makes
that very

386
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,510
very handy so we're good install that
now

387
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,540
so next next next next

388
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,200
axe out you have to accept right read
the whole thing

389
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,780
and accepts righty don't disobey

390
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,090
the Donnie people like cutting ties up
mattresses and stuff

391
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,120
hiring so given access and next

392
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,480
finish once it's done

393
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,040
rapa got are system pretty much set up
to be a man is is

394
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,159
a.m. this this ESXi server now

395
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,310
so you're gonna do use we're gonna put
in our IP address

396
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,990
are using a min and password his name
again was removed because that's the

397
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,020
only count we have on ESXi server

398
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,450
this point Subaru the password

399
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:35,260
and I'm weeks at the the certificate

400
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,639
and we build up and it tells us that we
are

401
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:41,649
now an a trial mode

402
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:45,450
okay for 60 days my show you how you can
go n

403
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,460
and but then key n because it is a

404
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,700
needle in a haystack she had it done
before

405
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,770
its that Spain fine so on

406
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,020
yeah I had no idea what I'm doing

407
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,210
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
ahead and and and bring up the

408
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:06,669
the ESXi server through the Fisher
client

409
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:10,300
register VMware ESXi server through the
beast your client

410
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:15,200
and then we're going to you I am again
use the key that we got only registered

411
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,190
I RDS XI excusable the people down so

412
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,409
from when we when we come through

413
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:27,909
for streaming up at the top you can read
it I'm sure but is that inventory up

414
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:30,220

417
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,399
so you go in there and then

418
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:46,120
go to the Configuration tab and the far
right side in the configuration had

419
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,679
their low at Link

420
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,470

427
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:22,070
alright so I once we once we get that
set up or log and and you can look at

428
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,840
the bottom right hand corner lawyer
tells us that we're in a

429
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,649
and a trial mode if you look just prior
does is allow you to merge six it is

430
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:29,929
raining

431
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:33,580
ago way so where n

432
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,220
we're managing it what do we do with it
now I am

433
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,480
you're gonna do is we're gonna set up
the VMware re Center

434
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,070
converter stand-alone application on our
windows 8.1

435
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,659
the AM our management VM and what this
will allow us to do

436
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,669
Israel to import encumbered VM

437
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:56,970
images on onto the ESXi server

438
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,220
K also transfer them

439
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,409
over so you can go and an

440
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:08,179
and pull down the me senator converter

441
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:12,840
Morgan say that anger and run it
directly from the system

442
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,200
yes next next

443
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,840

links each other's or around as it this

458
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,040
morning

459
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,099
so if you want to go out ports on those
down you'll be able to see

460
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:27,740
alright so everyone knows the shin

461
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,760
the terminal on in in Kali

462
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,250
as a quick screenshot within was in
Sarah WTF

463
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,909
every offensive Myrtle distribution has

464
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:42,310
its strengths and weaknesses so
depending on what your testing on what

465
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,710
you're wanting to learn

466
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,899
bullpen on which which district I wanna
run

467
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:51,200
um but there are there many many grades
will set out there that will save you

468
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,320
time to time

469
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,669
most of us to do this professionally
will modify heavily

470
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:00,940
the distributions that were running on
to have full sets that we want to have

471
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,659
every time having that a VM with snap
shining

472
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:07,780
makes things much much easier should
keep us man

473
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,750
do that every time so they're a virtual
appliances even pull out as well

474
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,820
there's a great router the people down
want to get into Cisco stuff

475
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,020
andrea is great to be able to learn some
some ACLs and things that sort

476
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:25,730
PSN some AB's BSNs awesome Farrell

477
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,740
um and there's IPS is

478
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,970
IDS is scary anion and use that rate

479
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:37,260
I really involved us has em I'll is a is
a great Sam

480
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,119
so they're all kinds open source options
for us to be able to get out there and

481
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,169
and utilize those and india will play
with them in our byron

482
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,760
if you don't have the the understanding
wanna Sam is near plying for role that

483
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,280
manages Sen

484
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,770
then it may be in your best interest
what analysts n runs and jumps through

485
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,700
your network

486
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,119
see what pulls out or on there are

487
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,300
your point large to it and runs and done
through it I

488
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,450
generally always keep security onion on
on a VM

489
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,280
on my box the reason being is I can use
TCP replay

490
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,450
road P cap through it and watch what all

491
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,849
security and pulls out a snort knowledge
predefined

492
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:21,409
rules and things that's where the got
set up in it amazing

493
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:25,119
save you time to time mainly picking
apart a VM

494
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,460
are picking apart he get so these things
make our lives very very easy

495
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,450
if you learn to use them effectively
inside the

496
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,869
the spear client I believe the parent is
a

497
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:41,179
VMware virtual appliances market place
you got to an

498
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:44,419
and take a look at bat I've gotta also
got a couple

499
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:48,119
links to you from other lists

500
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:52,159
VMware are virtual appliances you can
utilize

501
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,340
on the following slides but

502
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,000
virtual appliances a great now for
global distributions this used to be a

503
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,179
thorn in my side

504
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:04,340
they were very hard to find their worst
sparse

505
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,060
all over the place an and it was it was
hard to know whether or not you're going

506
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,210
to get all general on

507
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,690
with her or if you're a good one that
someone else had

508
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,250
add preloaded try to you know he is
traffic to your network switches that

509
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,899
happen

510
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:21,419
quite a bit I am thanks to you

511
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,210
I am you many many great people we have
some

512
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,980
some amazing moral distributions that
are out there

513
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,820
and I'm and I'd like to give a special
thanks

514
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,960
specifically to the guys at long hard
for being able to put all these together

515
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,000
in one place

516
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,639
have reviewed on the ball I'll awesome

517
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:46,349
so long hard is an amazing resource but
the other by got milk: who's in this

518
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:46,869
room

519
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:50,790
allergy was be recognized are not head

520
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:54,570
but a amazing work by those guys in and

521
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,909
and they really have put it on a work
into it and

522
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:01,580
an aids around applause for for for put
that together

523
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,409
for anyone that does not stop talk

524
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:10,240
and he's give me a few stickers up the
money on the table if he wants those

525
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,929
during the during the %um into the talk
you can properly come up and snag them

526
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,260
I am don't run from

527
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,290
something like DVL on your on your
primary box

528
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:27,379
or as a you know as something that your
bridge now on the network

529
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:31,450
um make sure you run the stuff
responsibly these things are inherently

530
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,470
vulnerable they're made to get popped

531
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,889
you put on the edge you're gonna get pop
so make sure you protect that starr

532
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,000
if you want to set up a honeypot or
something for someone to be able to

533
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,649
attack

534
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:45,730
do that but make sure that you something
like PSS

535
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,109
to block them from being able to come
further into network

536
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:52,580
right learning to use virtualization

537
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,690
a networking components that are built
into most hyped risers

538
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,980
and being able to you know turned to
manage their stuff will help

539
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,900
so what we're gonna do for this portion
others were going to use born Aug we're

540
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,609
gonna pull down

541
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:09,859
I am a copy miss little too as a as a
viable

542
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:15,050
on gas distribution and we're gonna pull
that and through the VMware the center

543
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,550
converter stand-alone we're going to
bird that into the ESXi server

544
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,880
organized attack a had so basically what
we do you

545
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,040
is we go and we pull that down has to be
extracted

546
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,300
once you get on Sat you got your VMX
file their

547
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,810
so we're gonna go into the Syrian the
center converter

548
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,109
and then and import that so we select

549
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:44,130
VMware workstation

550
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,359
or other VMware virtual I'm

551
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,190
appliance are machine is what it says

552
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,720
and as the as the item bring a slight

553
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,770
that VMX file

554
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,520
.org.in tilted 7 to convert it and bring
it in

555
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,660
so we had next when

556
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,770
handed it stars pulling that and you
then have to provide the

557
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:13,089
credentials again for your ESXi server
when she provided those credentials

558
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:16,430
then it stars the processor I've

559
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:21,470
transferring this are converting it and
getting ready to transfer data network

560
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:26,140
so you name it had next

561
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,330
continue going on on next most cities

562
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,640
a ganar Rd Falls unless it's something
that's

563
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,790
pretty readily known to you already

564
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:40,599
we're just going to keep in next we have
finished and then we're gonna go and

565
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,880
look inside

566
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,820
the beach your client had mister klein
again as well or managing this ESXi

567
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,800
server with

568
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,500
so once we get in the meter client I we
can see

569
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,580
that it's there I but not fully yet

570
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,690
yeah another 1i image is gone dole

571
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,859
alright so anyways so status

572
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:07,210
you can see it at 76 percent up there's
is currently

573
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,670
I loading up now and now are

574
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,700
are vital VM is now within the ESXi
server

575
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,330
K so what do we do now

576
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:24,099
or guidance that up and once we have the
most supposed to be empowered on

577
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:27,310
will go back into the the Kali p.m. on

578
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:31,280
that we have on VMware Fusion and thats

579
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,690
you know I just had that set up already
on

580
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,920
enamel will scan enumerated take a look
at it

581
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,560
cave show you how how you can Care Act
with it when it when it's

582
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,290
months actually stood up and from the
Italian

583
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,710
attends a VM will scan the range and and
just

584
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,280
just play around with a little bit so
inside v

585
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,790
the sphere client basically just come in
here and you can right-click

586
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:02,270
on on the VM monks like power Intel
powered on

587
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:07,109
and it will boot up you can actually see
it ok for little place symbol

588
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:12,320
on the icon for it and at the top left
you can also expand

589
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,970
the the tree there be able to see it
there as well

590
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,480
along with all the other BM's so

591
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,740
but actually spend up and we'll take a
look at you

592
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:31,060
who

593
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,810
alright so on this is the year 6i server

594
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:39,810
I'm currently and I have this cable it

595
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:45,359
so there's again when he sold previously
this is running you can see the internal

596
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,420
DHCP scope ovett me

597
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,920
it

598
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,589
this is our I Wendy's eighty

599
00:38:57,589 --> 00:39:01,349
management system and hopefully I can
remember the password to get back into

600
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:08,349
it

601
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,170
loading

602
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:22,950
story and we can look at have only a
couple the M's in there right now

603
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,470
I miss belittles one of those launches
another

604
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,690
on there are hundreds up their arm

605
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:33,230
on pornhub that you can get up learn
with so grant

606
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,540
right click on that power power on

607
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,920
I'll we can also power on this one as
well you can

608
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,880
powered on this by hitting play button
atop and now we see that both those have

609
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,140
a little play icons

610
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,140
on them over in left menu so they are

611
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,580
they're both running so temporarily what
we're gonna do

612
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:59,300
as I'm just gonna some shut them down
real fast

613
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,870
I want you to see id we scan that
internal Rangers nothing there

614
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:08,140
and then we go back in and scan it
one-third

615
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,330
once served it up we get we get results
we get things

616
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:18,330
hopping addis so the callous attack me
and sitting on top be or fusion

617
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,270
had to type it in correctly animated

618
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:41,270
iraq

619
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:49,260
so

620
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,640
so we see that we're I 160

621
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,930
are 192 168 66 on that's for an scandals
on them

622
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:08,930
you can use and map

623
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:26,560
Laurent

624
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,990
so once this gets through scanning will
see we have very little

625
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,990
I'm me run that ago

626
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:39,600
so everything I think there's there we
see host damn

627
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,810
all would enlist pretty much the

628
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,680
see nothing I everything Zen diesel is
go back over here let's turn it back up

629
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,680
and let's

630
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,800
in just a second do in them will do the
same scan again

631
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:10,800
and see what more information we come
back with things should really light up

632
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,370
for us

633
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:20,630
special and has most global very
inherently

634
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:27,630
long blocks

635
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,460
me

636
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,900
say we go a twenty-two people for 381

637
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,320
100 got plane boards here lineup white
Christmas tree

638
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,150
so

639
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:55,820
how many view scanned in an hour before
just just done a simple scan

640
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,210
okay great cable if you have in

641
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,530
you know reason there are no no excuse
not to now

642
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,530
great you know I had to do it on someone
else's production network you can set

643
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,030
this up on your own system

644
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:11,150
and and play around with it learn the
tools they expected the No

645
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,550
some the stop again at you know it

646
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,320
is very basic in and so it's often
avoided

647
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,990
by the InfoSec nearly one comes the the
staff conferences

648
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,770
on and Anna I honestly

649
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,810
you know my outlook on it was that I
thought the Saab would be

650
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:33,369
too basic for his comp myself but others

651
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:37,060
felt needed to make sure that that it
was given because

652
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,670
they think people will benefit from it
and I agree with them everyone starts

653
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:41,150
and

654
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:44,359
somewhere right everyone has to has to
start somewhere

655
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:51,260
yes

656
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:58,260
EDM right

657
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,869
in miss the observer's you know Ned

658
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:07,290
every system administrator needs to
understand how to run simple things like

659
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:07,640
not

660
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,369
not like a nap to be able to map out
your environment see was running

661
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:14,660
that you don't know is there because
most the time

662
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:18,119
just simply looking at one or two
systems and what services they're

663
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:18,710
offering

664
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:22,250
is not gonna show you the entire
environment yes

665
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,420
your

666
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:31,520
you yes

667
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,530
see

668
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,849
so that was the make sure you inform
stock when you're out when you're

669
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,270
running scanning Prosser

670
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,010
the environment you didn't you can
trigger some alerts and scare some

671
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:43,510
people

672
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,190
so mmm I

673
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:50,150
I was gonna go through the I a larger
exploit against on

674
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:54,000
against the Metasploit will be n

675
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,690
but we're running too short a time early
for me to be a road to go through that

676
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,290
old

677
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,030
process you can see that it's best
scanning here

678
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,520
we have all kinds information on this
guy

679
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,700
on these two systems and

680
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,820
and we know that that there are some
definite margulies within our

681
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,780
environment now

682
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,710
now's the next Apple okay so how do I
test this

683
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:19,840
right get out there and learn teach
yourself

684
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,119
pull down the hall will be ends and and
and do it

685
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,710
and annual be amazed at ed what you gain
from in

686
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:34,710
so saddam home finish this guy up

687
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,420
yes

688
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,800
no Adobe updates

689
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,540
right so I am congratulations

690
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,740
you've gone through the process a love
setting up a a virtual testing lab

691
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,780
near 6a hypervisor I am

692
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,960
give your Windows VM to manage that
hypervisor successfully

693
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,680
be able to put it all together and

694
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,280
you know where to obtain the offensive
appliances

695
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,329
and and vulnerable virtual machines

696
00:46:14,329 --> 00:46:17,730
or lease you will hear next coming
slides on

697
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:21,579
to be able to to build this out on your
own and teach yourself and learn

698
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:24,990
doesn't matter whether your you're going
on the pen testing

699
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,099
or looting or forensics or

700
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:31,630
if you want getting to exploit
development everything

701
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,829
big you need to learn with an
information security you can

702
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:38,559
put into a virtual environment and save
result

703
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,349
hundredth time Jared to teach is often
for their skills at

704
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:46,510
on you also know that to convert and
transfer them

705
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:50,520
i read your yes XI server to be sent a
client

706
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,980
and are being weird bird

707
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,109
so and you saw how he he was in numeric
guests with an

708
00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:01,680
within that environment from her caliber
yen I am

709
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,470
you know in for a sec recruiters want
people that know the tool sets they

710
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,069
don't just

711
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:11,530
need people out there that that had the
certifications and

712
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:15,460
and have the degrees the people they can
speak intelligently about

713
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,720
how that how that works at a fun day
foundational level

714
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,660
and and so that's what we need to do it
takes time it's not easy

715
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:28,109
but it definitely will pay off it
doesn't help monetarily for you at least

716
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:29,000
it will pay off

717
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,530
in the long run with your with your
skill set your career

718
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,579
and in the words a Rob Schneider

719
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,140
nice current look alright crash

720
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,930
nice at least that part thereof

721
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:46,020
fails not yet so

722
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,299
I am I have a pinwheel death

723
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:54,569
screeched add

724
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:59,180
only get the slide back up at least free
as you I am

725
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,160
30 get linked to be a report on this the
slide deck

726
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:10,160
that back up for a fast I'm gonna skip
Schneider

727
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:14,720
me my

728
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,329
yet there on those that alright so

729
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,920
again I am

730
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,470
the the links forties

731
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,690
are in the in the presentation

732
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:33,250
so ESXi download registration

733
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:36,799
player fusion workstation parallels
VirtualBox

734
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:39,869
all your offensive than and

735
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:43,260
and you know the primary

736
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,720
the end the users tools within per sec

737
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,970
I am and then you've also got your

738
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:53,190
virtual appliances here again the top
three there are

739
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:56,220
are all your I am your lists and then

740
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,270
some the bottom ones are are things that
I find very few very fruitful to learn

741
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:00,839
from

742
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:04,799
and then I i'm not gonna give any more
links for all the lower will be ends are

743
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:05,900
so many other them

744
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,510
it's a it's a huge number them but
they've all been

745
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:13,299
very well put together all the guys
Obama and so

746
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:16,809
I make sure you go there and check it
out and and pull down some

747
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:20,319
some symbol will be ends I am

748
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,440
one more thing if you guys are in the
area and local go and check out hacker

749
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,059
con

750
00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:29,190
coming up in just the a a month or so
and attend

751
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:33,500
Charleston West Virginia thank you guys
very much

752
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:40,500
appreciate your time and good question

753
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:44,339
okay yet yes by

754
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:47,440
you you where

755
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,740
shit E why you

756
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,109
yes I

757
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:57,390
you where year

758
00:49:57,390 --> 00:50:02,540
so the reason so that the question again
was do I recommend

759
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,650
ESXi overtopping VMware Fusion

760
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,730
the reason this was presented this way
is because I want you to be able to know

761
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,270
how you can set this up

762
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:14,859
on an actual physical environment as an
ESXi server

763
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:20,049
the more fusion while I can run all the
time and had multiple BN's within it

764
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:23,579
is not usually I managed without having
had

765
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:27,290
display on that system said save you
having

766
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,660
and yes and it's free okay so

767
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,599
that's a that's a big consideration but
you know you can have a headless blocks
