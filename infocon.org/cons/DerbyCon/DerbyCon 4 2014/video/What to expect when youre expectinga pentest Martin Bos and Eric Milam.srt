2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,540
thanks for sticking around for the late
sunday talk said no not a lot of people

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,240

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,760
on them so alright

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,010
so Lorgat talk about today is what to
Expect When You're Expecting a pen test

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,690
I'll for small here in the rooms a pen
tester

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:29,060

fucking clue what they're doing

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,169

13
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:57,069
even though they never choice but
whatever I'd sell

14
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:00,260
I is one boss I'm a penetration tester

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,420
or come Kelly 1x project I'll II work on
Derby Conn

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,850
I'm not a CISSP and then a Down here's
my little odd Twitter handle

17
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,960
you want to follow me on Twitter for
semantics I'm at my job to get by tony

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,430
is brought back some love you

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,340
also involve look calisthenics not leap
and tester d-mont parts and management

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:21,780
so

21
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,240
I have my CISSP an accident there okay

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,960
so and bra black bottom acting

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,619
so we got a little disclaimer here in
the game arm

24
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,729
anybody's an attrition fanboy we did not
cite

25
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:42,509
any a bar fucking pictures and the stock
we stole everything

26
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,990
and laszlo's Deadpool I had one other
disclaimer is that you got a lot so

27
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,180
you are on our customers the partisan
route where lower

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,869
personal yet some of us are

29
00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:02,869
game cool so what are we can talk about
today here sort of our agenda that we

30
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,460
wanna

31
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,080
that we want to refer to your gonna talk
about penetration testing

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,269
vulnerability assessments risk
assessments kinda what the difference is

33
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:13,310
a lot of people have different opinions
on what's while

34
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,160
so that covers the who what where when
why and how we're going to talk about

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,180
high-impact vulnerabilities is anybody
ever heard those anybody got him out

36
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,829
there

37
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:25,910
got a couple and shop HIV patients in
the house

38
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,410
I'll go talk about cyber hygiene

39
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,980
common you new thing we'll talk about

40
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,990
security maturity we're gonna talk about
risk appetite

41
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,820
and a and we can talk about some thought
leaders there may be some polymers in

42
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,180
this room

43
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,910
fiber thought leaders even but I saw
club but later

44
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,090
affected I in

45
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,250
alright so this is kinda barbers enough
what we think security today looks like

46
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,740
does this look familiar to anybody that
works in a blue team environment

47
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,480
just got a large organization looks like
I'll

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,860
elicited skies following so a lot of
times we going to organizations and

49
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,990
and and this is what we find right they
don't really have

50
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,760
up plan they haven't had a proper test
they don't

51
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,170
know how to strategize their security
program isn't even know what a proper

52
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,120
test is

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,130
exactly they don't even know what
they're getting into penetration test

54
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,580
and so once again here's their own a lot
of money at the problem

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,110
a train wreck and then ultimately a
nuclear explosion on something like

56
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,780
harpley

57
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,030
happens or what's the newest where you
is

58
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,690
so this is a guy who found shell shock
everybody is on what you want

59
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,640
yeah him you

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,400
you cannot be outgoing so of course you
know user you need to get a fantastic

61
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,690
read a lot to be an hour before

62
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,370
rooms where they're like hey authors
says we need a pentasa what the hell

63
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,340
does that mean

64
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,560
I don't know what this guy can do it for
500 bucks so

65
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,340
you know ultimately what we're saying is
you gotta know what you're getting right

66
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,430
what is a paint that's what does that
really mean that's really what this talk

67
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,190
is gonna focus on right you got the
douchebag up there

68
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,710
with this the classes and then

69
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,360
your target dog right all and so this is
the sleazy sales guy right so what

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,220
happens is

71
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,360
a penetration test sound sexy right it
sounds cool

72
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,489
red team red team like all those kinda
term some really great and so that's

73
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,620
when sales people are out there selling
unfortunately and I'm not talking about

74
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,340
every organization I'm talking about our
personal experience with

75
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,860
our organization and others were not
just picking on everybody else

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,920
somewhere you know i'd sales person goes
into an organization says

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,700
you don't want to be the next target do
you gotta get a penetration test while

78
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,120
these people have never had any kind of
third-party testing whatsoever so

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,000
they're going from

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,050
a all the way to am without you in AB
and C and they're doing it because

81
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,720
somebody is telling them that this is
what they need

82
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,830
I read it CIO magazine need to get
wannabes

83
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:57,780
being so that takes us into the next
thing that we want to talk about is

84
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,500
under finding some terms

85
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,110
on we want to make sure that everybody
understands um

86
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,520
our terms regarding some of these things
on

87
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,120
they're not back they're not on
Wikipedia they're not these are just

88
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,810
some in there

89
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,690
some other terms that that we like we to
make them up either

90
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,240
these are just some other terms that we
like to describe this kinda stuff rights

91
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,730
penetration task basically you know what
you're looking at

92
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,860
penetration test is

93
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,520
not just about to believe that exists
not think that the scanner fines were

94
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,409
looking at a

95
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:33,949
what can we actually do and the value to
the customers how far we can take this

96
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:37,860
can we get to the HR the cardholder data
environment or whatever it is

97
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,139
it's really taking that next step up not
only finding the boner billing

98
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:46,979
but also explain the bill at the
vulnerability movie airport to show well

99
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,449
truth somewhat true malicious intent can
do within the organization

100
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:54,629
with the limited amount of data that
they have mmm

101
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:58,400
and so it's interesting regarding the
penetration test we get this a lot

102
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,659
on as we come into an organization and
we bind

103
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:05,819
are one way and then we use that way and
and then we escalate to the network and

104
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,289
get

105
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:10,240
you know domain am at RPI or whatever
and then we write the report ever

106
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,080
outlining how we did all this stuff

107
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,389
and our clients talk about what about
you know like

108
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,229
all the other vulnerabilities on our
network the last time we ran a scanner

109
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,569
at said we had forty million
vulnerabilities or something like that

110
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:23,139
and

111
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,699
and and I'll feed you know where where
those in this report and we say well

112
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,039
that's not a penetration test right
that's

113
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,629
about what we like to refer to you as a
vulnerability assessment

114
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,370
Yap you

115
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,419
great segue set up

116
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,900
so that takes in the 1i voter ability
assessment is right a voter Billy

117
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,410
assessment is designed to look at the
entire network and that's where

118
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,090
automated scanners come from I use I'll
he is not amenable to really scanner

119
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,010
a way to get up here and says that they
don't

120
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,250
I'll I'll is is lying

121
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,479
and a a they save a lot of time

122
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,990
and a lot of times evil one runner our
penetration test will run a

123
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,520
vulnerability scanner at the end to the
engagement to help our clients see the

124
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,139
overall picture of their environment but
it's not to be mistaken with the pen

125
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:11,900
test right

126
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,080
um also not to be mistaken with

127
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,080
people that run a vulnerability scanner
and then run their pen test of %uh the

128
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,030
results of the vulnerability scanner
that's also not penetration testing

129
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,979
that's what we like to call manually
verifying vulnerabilities after they've

130
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,530
been found with the scanner

131
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,610
recto so the way our methodology is

132
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,780
at all to speak for me and Martin has I
hope attack Iran's methodology but it

133
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,580
might not be but

134
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,419
were basically we like the task in two
different ways right the first day or so

135
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,789
should be completely passive no you know
phone scanner know anything like that

136
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,870
and what we're hoping to provide to the
customer is if you can catch me

137
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,849
attacking you like an attacker then
you're in much better shape because once

138
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,229
I fired up the phone scanner

139
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:58,750
talkin every ball unless a linearization
should be going all

140
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,020
and there's nothing going off and of
course that's horrible but

141
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,780
if we can show you that we're attacking
you like this we can help you

142
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,889
you know I don't know get your stands

143
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,070
set up properly year get really
actionable results at what we're able to

144
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,050
be passively

145
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,610
that's going to add in my opinion more
value to the cost more than just some

146
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,470
the coming in runner

147
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,750
balls again

148
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,300
them that brings us into the next pass
it up testing that's available

149
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,700
and so this happens a lot of times after
we do our report

150
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,120
when our clients are alike alright well
let's mirus

151
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,880
right and so as as Penn testers like

152
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,780
hate the word risk because I'm like a
one or a0 coming out right is either

153
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,340
broke

154
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,430
or it's not broke they're sitting there
on or its all

155
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,790
right and so when i'm looking at a
vulnerability

156
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,660
it's vulnerable and on I'll I don't
operate in the way were like well I want

157
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,170
to buy

158
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,410
first level at like a followers so like
but

159
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,840
we got special guys for that right
obviously companies don't have unlimited

160
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,580
budgets and they can't fix everything so
they need a

161
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,930
look at %uh their risk appetite which
will cover laters

162
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,980
Banahan and so

163
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,460
this is a totally different type of
testing basically where there's not a

164
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,290
lot of technical stuff done we're good
comes in and make

165
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,740
take a look at the vulnerabilities and
they help the customer prioritize those

166
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,160
vulnerabilities and decide what they can
afford to fix on what time table with

167
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,400
one among the people

168
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,579
and and it's an important process right

169
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,510
I mean it really is all these and that's
what I want to say is that all the steps

170
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,339
and testing or

171
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:39,089
equally important in the organization
they just have to be done in the correct

172
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,260
order and so what happens is a lot of
these other facets at st. men are very

173
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,100
sexy like a risk assessment

174
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,339
it's not sexy right now that's fuckin
sexy right there

175
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:53,570
I a risk assessment is not sexy right so
nobody wants to do it as a penetration

176
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,800
test sexy

177
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,400
yet and we tell our guys a pen test is a
pen test is a pen test

178
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,899
we don't

179
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,800
look we look it's a very easy don't look
at risk because me as a pen tester is on

180
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,759
site per week

181
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,860
the a I it would be complete hubris the
think I understand what I found

182
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,920
and what that her risk is your
organization you probably

183
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,920
as an organization have an entire risk
department set up to decide that

184
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,509
but we tested we show what we have
accomplished with that we give it the

185
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,269
severity we've had plenty o

186
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:26,629
call argument to conversations are but

187
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:30,809
discussions with with customers you know
who want to change or severity

188
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,720
they don't think that's the rest can we
say based on what we have accomplished

189
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,490
this is a bear day

190
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,850
and we have is a course outlined as to
why explaining

191
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,420
but severity and rest should be two
completely different things for the

192
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,069
organization

193
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:48,129
up and so there's one other guy
protesting on that we see out there a

194
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,139
lot in the world

195
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:53,850
doing and you know everybody likes haha
I

196
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,600
everybody likes to harp on testing her
my compliance you know PCI testing and

197
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,800
people check in the box and and say an

198
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,059
no PC eyes on security and although that
is true

199
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,279
however a lot of times we going to
organizations that don't have never done

200
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,139
any type of security testing whatsoever

201
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,889
you know they may like run the free
version MSS you know every now and then

202
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:14,709
or wherever

203
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:17,999
and buckle but they don't know where to
begin and sell %uh

204
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:22,120
something that I do you think is
important is that is that PCI in like

205
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,709
him but I and some others other baseline
standards

206
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:28,439
can be used as a place for organizations
to start

207
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:32,149
you know obviously they're not security
and there's way all kinda stuff you want

208
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,149
to do after but the key and be important
because it gives you a baseline

209
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,279
guideline to get started somewhere so

210
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,749
while we don't like testing for
compliance on in some cases it can be

211
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:44,720
useful

212
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,059
and it's better than doing nothing right
I think we can all agree that at least

213
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:52,390
against I spoke just in the right
direction organization

214
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,150
by seller

215
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:00,070
red talk about how do I know that I need
a pen test and I'll

216
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,190
you know what are the signs and
indicators that I'm ready for a pen test

217
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,480
you I

218
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,520
the first one is we gotta stop use and
stuff like this I stole this line from

219
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,020
Dave a long time ago opinions that ever
since

220
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,420
fucking awesome so anyway um

221
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,220
I mean this is crazy and I go and a lot
organizations where

222
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,380
they got some come up for me lol like
this

223
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,500
that their determining their risk level
with

224
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,420
and they're not taking any of the
environment variables into account

225
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,140
they're not taking like what we can do
during a pen test into account they're

226
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,780
just

227
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,110
creating a formula determining their
budget and

228
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,310
figurine now you know what their risk
level is gonna be and

229
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,300
and what that really means enough for me
like this is you know how much

230
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,330
you know bad stuff can happen to me
before my boss gets mad at me at the end

231
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,540
of the year and so this is a terrible
way

232
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,930
to start doing testing and so
organizations that are utilizing a model

233
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,310
like this would greatly benefit by some

234
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:07,320
testing by compliance to get started
with writing

235
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,740
so you have to think about to right
there what do you actually looking to

236
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,400
protect

237
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,610
and I mean I know a lot of Pentastar so
I got domain admin this that nothing but

238
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,630
what we really need to know is antacids
and what would help the organization is

239
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,360
you know what what is your sensitive
data if you're coca-cola

240
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,470
you know it's the the secret formula
right or

241
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,080
Wendy's hamburgers or whatever day is
what are you trying to protect what are

242
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,460
you doing to protect that

243
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,970
and its are goal as through penetration
test is there any type of testing the

244
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:38,990
show how easy

245
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,090
easy it is or how difficult it is to
access that type of information with any

246
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,450
organization

247
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,810
so I can tell you how many times I've
gone into an organization and I'm said

248
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,030
can you list the top five things that
make you money

249
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,380
you know what are the top five and they
can't tell me

250
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,350
they can always tell me what it is and
what's even more important as sometimes

251
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,960
I don't even know is a penetration
tester a perfect example I was working

252
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,420
at an oil and gas

253
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,650
company recently and I was doing a pen
test and i got into the database and I

254
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,850
thought I was really great and I got all
the customer names in the credit card

255
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,240
numbers you know the payroll

256
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,760
are not the payroll that the PO receipts
and I was like nozzles

257
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,490
skipping along house like a cop data and
%uh presented to the client and I said

258
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,450
look up on all your critical data and
they said well we don't really care

259
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,610
about that niles all I quite like

260
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,550
and they said you know I was like what's
important to you and they said that the

261
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,490
most important thing in their
organization was the

262
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,030
had Rawlings lemme and they were
surveying to drill for you all

263
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,570
like that never occurred to me right
like I never even thought about looking

264
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,740
for that step so

265
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,930
that's an example of an organization
that knew what they were trying to

266
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,780
protect but

267
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,900
so this is where risk assessment comes
in so if you're sitting around wondering

268
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,660
like

269
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,490
a on your arm our organization uses to
make money you're not ready for a

270
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,050
penetration test right you need

271
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,920
you need a vulnerability in a risk
assessment so that you can determine

272
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,320
where the data is how critical it is
that valuable is

273
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,350
so on and so forth get that question she
did you all the back to host discovering

274
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,220
what do I have what's open on this post

275
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,410
where they at you know what do I
currently stand with that we'll

276
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,410
alright so

277
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,160
a white chocolate this where we can talk
about the easy wins right so

278
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,160
time and time again we going to an
organization

279
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,070
and we find something that's could be
found by a vulnerability scanners what I

280
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,240
like to call an easy win

281
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,740
if necessary next boser such stupid one
call

282
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,790
shattered leg no comment trend has sorry
a way so if one of those vulnerabilities

283
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,900
scanners can find it there's absolutely
no excuse

284
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,320
for me to own you during a penetration
test without vulnerability

285
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,550
and if I do you you're wasting your
money right it's like burning into up

286
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,800
because if I can come in and I can run
SSI combined Apache year whatever we can

287
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,070
talk about some of those

288
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,670
and and order and compromise the
organization you should've gone back to

289
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,460
step one which is a vulnerability
assessment cell

290
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:10,190
before any kind a penetration test is
done you should have a program in place

291
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,790
that allows you to pick something I
group got thanks a lot I am group

292
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,730
airstrike like part was talking about I
mean how many times have we seen

293
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,850
this right ms let us examine it does not
exist it's out there

294
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:27,150
we spend testers were being brought into
Penn test your network were not coming

295
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,450
in to validate want to believe that
exist

296
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,520
within your network as mara was saying
with regards to

297
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,140
things that should have already been
done you are wasting your money on us to

298
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,890
come in and do that

299
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,430
Korean this vulnerability is so famous
for having fucking birthdays for

300
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,150
people and then there's always this
which is

301
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,350
the default password right admin admin I
love on top passer vers

302
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,640
JBoss to protect the JMX console

303
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,350
up asked to help he didn't I mean

304
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,160
admin password works on my list of
places I'm sorry

305
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,050
tom cat the upload your while hey look
it's a windows box I'm system okay

306
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,180
upload the BC dumb thick latex grads and
you probably got a server admin account

307
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,819
a domain admin or some service

308
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,880
so Tomcat JBoss are like our favor and I
access to her anything or eBay broke

309
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,839
because

310
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,250
people have gotten to where they're
finally fixing the Tomcat the whole

311
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,540
passwords but they're still not
protecting the serb like consuls

312
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,600
because it's not rated very high on the
vulnerability scanner right now they

313
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,030
don't realize that you can upload your
file and take full control

314
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,330
and what's crazy to me is that all the
stuff that are vulnerabilities

315
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,980
Skinner says is critical that's nonsense
like as I'll meet you

316
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,940
this is for some reason non but whatever

317
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,990
and it's funny to so what are the
conversations we always happen the

318
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,500
customer says we don't want any
exploitation right at all

319
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,540
don't argued what it is but I always
tell them okay but if I find

320
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,280
and I always use Tomcat if I find a tom
cat that I can log into you

321
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,950
and I can uploaded deploy work while I
don't consider that an exploit them

322
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,010
using it

323
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,290
in the way this is expected to be used
mister customer do you agree

324
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:08,190
yeah that's fine no problem so that's
why these things they don't get as much

325
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,930
love until someone like us come in and
take advantage of me

326
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:16,090
that I mean how hard is it to set a
strong password protect the circle

327
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:22,540
here's another all-time favorite anybody
got cold fusion on their networks tell

328
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,810
I'm pretty sure every version of
ColdFusion since like six

329
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,460
as like a critical vulnerability in

330
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,600
here I

331
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,040
per for the video he said thanks for
resurfacing my nightmare

332
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,990
I yeah we still see this all over the
place

333
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,990
even externally sometimes I

334
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,990
I got choked up over it

335
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:53,070
that's right another interesting thing
is deploying them is configurations we

336
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,800
take advantage of this type of stuff

337
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,530
all the time and a lot of times it's a
simple radio button in group policy

338
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,430
it's something really really simple so I
can this case anybody's responder

339
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,860
mayor longer so responder does poison in
over a couple different protocols

340
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,530
that miles is a little bit harder to fix
however a lot of times it uses

341
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,510
lol early L&L and anarchy it's hard to
say

342
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,210
ways your whatever it cell

343
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,830
saying

344
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,570
you're not but now and there's also I
mean that the check box her

345
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,239
turning off the broadcast over TCP were
net buyers easy fix

346
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:34,639
so a another one so another one that we

347
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:37,929
we like to recommend is I'll

348
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,850
and I'm not going to say this is a pic
surpass the hash but that this is

349
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,489
definitely a

350
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:44,739
a study that you should look at is up
for banning

351
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:49,190
local accounts local mister counter any
local can on the box login over the

352
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,379
network its a group Policy Object his

353
00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:55,570
but maddening at that now they can't log
in our cells

354
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,720
so the huge one well as Miami times you
guys fight like a password is up

355
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,309
yes exactly where SMB exact or whatever
dang

356
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:09,100
so if you don't you know this goes back
to you like if you don't have proper

357
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,139
blue team urs will talk about this a
little bit later but if you don't have

358
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,649
people that know how to work for this
type of stuff then you need to up your

359
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,499
game in your organization you're
definitely not ready for

360
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:23,730
rations in 10

361
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,190
mom at mars I mean that you know we we

362
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,690
we laugh about it or whatever but
patching passion is important that we

363
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,580
got the mic sup Tuesday

364
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,779
yell okay let XE and I'll get all the
great priest of

365
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,649
Mac will let you pay them to protect
your well

366
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:46,200
notebook Korea but patch is an important
part in a stain on top of what it is

367
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,309
you know having people who can actually
researched the things that come and

368
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,760
and understand not just what it's doing
but what happened what that will look

369
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,409
back

370
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:58,539
in your environment great and being able
to separate out the ones and

371
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:02,120
knowledgeably say this is really getting
access we need to get on this that we

372
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,840
need to make it happen no matter what

373
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,010
I'll he had been able to make calls

374
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,340
and to say you know what this is a mass
be passed outside the

375
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,669
in our center patching and or whatever
it is I mean

376
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:17,330
it's something that goes largely
unnoticed within an organization sites

377
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,399
are we don't pass to Saturday's but

378
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:23,399
it's because a lot of times people don't
understand exactly what it is what it

379
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:24,010
means and

380
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,340
and how it will affect the organization
so good she

381
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,000
for god sakes does not just me windows
right everything requires a patch

382
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,320
and I know that everybody knows that and
it sounds funny but I can't tell you how

383
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,250
many times

384
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,399
we've gone and done sorta you know a
high level architecture typer view an

385
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:44,730
upset explain your branching process and
they say we got SCCM and we use it every

386
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,500
Tuesday

387
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,620
I am were good and I'm all like I'll
what about the Linux boxes

388
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,610
you know like oh we have 1x are you know
like her what about Cisco

389
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,450
runabout you know whatever and there's
no processes in place for any and those

390
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,299
systems

391
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:03,149
or they're using some you know up anan

392
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:06,610
up this was quite a while ago but me and
Eric did a test where they

393
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,019
told us that there when Xboxes were all
the way up to date and then they told us

394
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:12,610
the two are not gonna crawl space law

395
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,090
I wasn't gonna call I'll space walk
lever a way that cool was open source

396
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:19,080
and phone of a loner abilities

397
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,630
you know we were able to come

398
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,740
runs the actual patching tool which is
ridiculous anyway but sell

399
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,360
you know having an organization you know
in place that understands patching on

400
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,800
all the different levels

401
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,270
and one other top three you know things
that do come at her party's

402
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,790
its third party catching it's almost
network segmentation third party

403
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,110
patching are almost everything or partly
right because it covers Apache and PHP

404
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,240
and all those things

405
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,010
and no one ever thinks about no one
understands that they even have on our

406
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,440
and there's usually not a process in
place like and nobody's going to admit

407
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,380
this on its gonna call now but talk
about hardly write

408
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,760
I mean it was essentially like a
third-party patch right and so

409
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,310
basically like I mean I saw a boner

410
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,640
companies falling all over themselves to
patch partly because they did not have a

411
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,070
process in place to patch those
third-party things and so

412
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,550
that's why I became such a disaster and
Sun organizations and I

413
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,240
you know course we're still finding and
I'm sure we will forever but but I'm

414
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,320
patching is really important and so

415
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,660
I like that stressin reiterate to people
that

416
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,130
that if you're not doing this you're
probably not ready for a penetration

417
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,760
test

418
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,150
and hardly another perfect example of
having people know what something does

419
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,800
because we had a lot to customer say

420
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,850
can you test this for us like yours
appear as you can to your cell

421
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,890
knew we'd like to take your ten thousand
dollars but let's be honest we

422
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,460
you know we want to get guys here and
they're like we don't we hire on this we

423
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,170
don't know it out

424
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,690
I thought I don't know what that is
great so ok

425
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,210
home

426
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,480
bonham owner Billy Skinner African love
owner Billy scanners because anything

427
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,940
they can you work for me

428
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,139
as awesome so the reason that I say this
is because

429
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:59,490
'we're touched on this a little bit but
if i cum in your organization own you

430
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,570
because something that should have been
found bob on our ability scanner

431
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,600
you are wasting your money paying me

432
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,809
because these things have gotten so
cheap

433
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:12,879
lately I mean back in the day like when
some other more 5 10 grand you know or

434
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:13,450
some

435
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,789
washing yearly license or whatever like
yonder still like a lot of smaller

436
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,869
companies couldn't get them however I
mean essence is like 1200 bucks for god

437
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:22,440
sakes

438
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,009
I mean like what company can afford that
and so

439
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:29,980
I anytime i go somewhere and they're not
deal Boehner ability scanning I'm like

440
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,110
up backup we gotta go all the way back
and start to implement a vulnerability

441
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,240
management program is that sexy no

442
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,330
but you are recommending yes and you I
help them do it yes because then

443
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,809
the next time that they engage us
they're gonna be a little bit more ready

444
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:45,840
and they won't be wasting their money as
much

445
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,080
I would rather spend time on sitting at
a client

446
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,460
scanning every seven that I find for
them I think there's more value in that

447
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,860
than having me just come in a pop-up
boxes and give them a or

448
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,529
it just makes so much more sense because
no one knows what's on the wireless

449
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:01,539
services are running

450
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:05,879
if you don't even know that I mean like
he said there's no didn't waste time and

451
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,629
money

452
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:09,070
here C

453
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,529
yes so that brings us to a new term

454
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:15,779
cyber hygiene look for this on CNN

455
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:22,450
and they had this thought leaders going
to get big suited

456
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,600
and I know it sounds funny but
unfortunately like it's kinda its

457
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,090
country right like we have to clean our
organization like multiple times

458
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,169
we have to keep it clean there's no use
in coming in and you in a vulnerability

459
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:38,460
and risk in a pen test all this stuff
you know like one time a year

460
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,999
and then one at all ballpark the rest in
the year and then come back and do it

461
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,289
again the on you know the other Thailand
so

462
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:48,799
I'll kinda like eric said like I would
much rather help a company

463
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,919
implement a program that does these
things

464
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,190
then just come in and destroy him from a
pen test cell like I would rather come

465
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:56,889
in and say

466
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:01,490
are you scheming you know let me help
you start scanning and show you how to

467
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,450
digest the results write something that
we think is really important about

468
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,399
portability scanners is that a lot of
times companies by them and they have no

469
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,610
idea how to digest the results and you

470
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,470
allies them in and they don't understand
that the ratings and although her

471
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,870
ability scanners are like of the wall
right and that have to be

472
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,470
you know and so that's where we come in
where we can say you don't look

473
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,130
I know it says this is high but we're
not openly exploiting this in the wild

474
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,670
curly we haven't seen an exploit for it
since 2005 urs

475
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,270
you know or something like that and then
we can say oh this is grossly underrated

476
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,600
tom cat we can own your entire system
the sleigh cell

477
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,280
you know that takes in remediation right
helping them learn mediate their

478
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,190
vulnerability scanning doesn't do any
good unless you have a program to

479
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,030
remediate

480
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,710
then you wanna retest right reveal her
abilities

481
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,290
and you don't just do it launch keep
doing it over and over again

482
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,900
and then another thing that we try to do
it you know in organizations is either

483
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,820
sanctions are rewards for

484
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,230
people that you know report things like
phishing attacks I call that kinda stuff

485
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,360
the stuff that falls outside the scope

486
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,480
you know our what we're doing on the
technical control

487
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,340
for I'll and then also coming in and
having third parties do the testing does

488
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,110
anybody trust their own security
organization that neither contest

489
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,510
the

490
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,230
acting thanks Mark yep should I

491
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,580
yep that thing is is yeah I mean I how
many defenders rather n

492
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,280
so happy show me and show a hand for a
quick how many times have you said this

493
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,100
is an issue now and listen to you

494
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,590
and then had testers come and and they
say the same thing and then they listen

495
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,270
to them all

496
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,910
that freestanding Natalie stock we feel
bad as testers as well

497
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,030
right for that simply please don't get
mad at us but but

498
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:51,010
you know we need to make sure that you
know when we go out there were educating

499
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,480
the people that we're working with

500
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,160
and not not the blue team urs I'm
talking about the management understand

501
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,270
that these people were right you should
listen to that

502
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,190
right let them do what they need to do
they want to help you a protector

503
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,440
Beijing cyber hygiene you heard it here
first

504
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,790
thing Swan make that call no

505
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,920
I tell us

506
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,640
you can axo risk appetite we fuckin hate
this concept

507
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,690
about we like it but the way it came
about so

508
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,580
Martin eyerer attic on and we were
having lunch

509
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,260
you were trying to happen II and a
gentleman said basically

510
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,240
I don't happen test I don't want and
test because I don't want to stay up

511
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,980
late at night

512
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,120
and we're like what are you talking
about like in

513
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,380
doesn't magically go away just because
you don't know about it right he's like

514
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:39,780
my

515
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,490
don't wanna do it I don't have the risk
appetite for what's gonna come at a bit

516
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,340
that's the first time I've ever heard it

517
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:50,270
but it ended at causing Martin taken at
Rose played down walkout and

518
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,450
I cried the top reason for this guy but
I was also like

519
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,500
out okay a to get it so it but it's
something that's come up right we get

520
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,450
that customers

521
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,960
that customers have a limited about what
their

522
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,970
they're willing to do a lot of times in
past customers tell us what we don't

523
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,310
want to text but it's because somebody
did some stupid people or or we won't

524
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,650
use can mean only at night

525
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,820
right somebody took something over but I
understand the in

526
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,360
us helping them understand what we do
about it how we're gonna go about it

527
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,060
whether methodology is what the expected
outcome is

528
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,370
and working with them in educating them
it how increase that risk appetite for

529
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,430
the organization because

530
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,930
there's definitely a lot of things that
we could pre with their with a pic on

531
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,590
Sat

532
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:36,060
but again going back to showing how far
can we go with this

533
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,949
and how actually affect your
organization

534
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:42,440
has lotta times or something tells me
well be fine X but I want you explain is

535
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,479
based on all right we'll

536
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:47,529
I find something like Tomcat Tomcat our
admin admin I'm just gonna call it a

537
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:49,589
critic on the record if you're
comfortable with that

538
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:53,249
not really a fair assessment because
maybe that systems not really even

539
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,289
joined to the domain and there's nothing
on there but

540
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:58,659
and they're not letting me go that far
because they risk appetite

541
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:02,190
you know we can't truly show them what
that

542
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:07,109
severity is the organization

543
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:10,709
alright so let's talk about some other
things that need to be done before

544
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:15,169
coming into Penn test monitoring

545
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:21,119
who monitors and their organization
alright

546
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,609
he thinks that they're monitoring za
effective in their organization

547
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:31,099
let the record show that one person
raise their hand I

548
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:34,249
and he's not very trustworthy said

549
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:38,309
I'm so tell me this mister monitoring
and their organization

550
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:42,469
you monitor for successful logins on
port 445

551
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:46,519
I'll with the same account multiple
times

552
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,889
a service account that has been changed
in 10 years

553
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:54,449
am has a pen tester would never do that
with day

554
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:58,359
I'll anyway so mongering right

555
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:02,099
something that's really really really
important as monitoring an organization

556
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:02,699
and

557
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:06,589
I know that's been sad all at the time
but it's an effective monitoring process

558
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:08,499
and testing it to you and sell

559
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:12,249
I date was just talking about this said
over in his talk like I can't tell you

560
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:14,969
how many times I've gone into somewhere
and they've said

561
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:18,489
we got dark side and we paid likes
so-and-so

562
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:22,489
like however many colors $5 million
dollar a million dollars and they came

563
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:23,530
in and they worry

564
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,960
rules for three weeks and you know like
those guys used to be on like

565
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,210
you know on some pent esteem in like
nineteen ninety nine so they know what's

566
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,990
up for whatever you know i sat out 2608
thing and then we go in there and we

567
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,720
created domain admin account and we you
know kick our feedback and we wait for

568
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,250
and

569
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,470
you know too but russia's right cuz they
saw it but you know like three days

570
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,300
later

571
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,410
like were like well where right behind
me

572
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:54,020
and so what happens is is like the
monitoring was broken the monitoring was

573
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,320
misconfigured a perfect example was

574
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,920
and on a pen test we usually don't
create DA account however it's really

575
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,110
helpful to customers to proves

576
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,980
a lot of times that they're not
monitoring right it's not a very

577
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,900
stealthy thing to do however

578
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,720
we like to do it a lot of times just to
see if a customer's mongering and so the

579
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,940
I add story about that I was recently at

580
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,400
in their security company to which is
interesting and so they were monitoring

581
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,600
with something or other and they were
monitoring on Windows a band

582
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,890
codes and so they had gotten the windows
event code for creating

583
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:29,070
domain admin account with incognito
because they thought that that's how

584
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,370
attackers will be doing it with the
Metasploit San mature

585
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,740
burger and all that stuff right so
that's the amend what they didn't do you

586
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,780
was test all the different ways to
create a domain admin account

587
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,960
legitimately and

588
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,470
illegitimately and realize that there's
five different event codes

589
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,740
I so they were only monitoring for one
of them so what I did was just connected

590
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,890
a window shelling you know net user at
Bob Loblaw

591
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,090
and they never saw my domain admin
account because they want monitoring on

592
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,390
the budget creation so that's like a
perfect example of where

593
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:04,880
some honoring was in place but it failed
however what happened was bringing in

594
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,910
the third party pen testing company
uncovered that kinda stuff

595
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,320
and just one other thing dat ass in my
last

596
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,660
top is how many guys would actually know
it when it's your domain admins that

597
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:21,290
rather is anybody right because the
persons doing what they're supposed to

598
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,020
be doing

599
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,230
with the with an account they're
supposed to using at

600
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,340
how do you monitor that right and those
are important things that we need to

601
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,560
figure out because

602
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,930
good people do bad thing and I'll talk
about how to get some

603
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:40,630
knowledge in a moment we'll password
policies I love passwords a male knows

604
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:40,990
me

605
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,330
so dust so does Eric we like passwords
so he's got a password policy in their

606
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,350
organizational

607
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,610
his password policy is the doc all
Windows a

608
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,480
characters with the three dollar

609
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,530
I different policies further elevating
user accounts

610
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,770
nice how many people test to see if

611
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:06,980
the hash for an admin account and
regular account

612
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,050
match awesome

613
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,450
mmm so about

614
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:18,230
that's about standard so password
policies are really tricky right because

615
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,760
it's really difficult to enforce a
password policy in an organization as

616
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,830
the security person

617
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,570
you would love to implement and I've
never met a security person that did not

618
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,440
want to implement some ridiculous
password policy right like 15 characters

619
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,730
or something like that

620
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:35,540
however the fact of the matter is is
that security needs are pretty low on

621
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,210
the totem pole and a lot organization
cell like

622
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,090
your requests is it gonna get very far
because the CEO's gonna be like

623
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:47,119
hell now on I remember and that because
I gotta type it in my shiny new iPad

624
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,700
every time I get 1 I'm not gonna do that
so

625
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,250
on however it does matter right password
policies matter

626
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,630
a whole lot and so I can't tell you how
many times we got an organization has a

627
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,960
weak password policy

628
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,700
and sell when I go into our organization
for a pen test we talk about the

629
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,280
password policy if it's

630
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,100
if it's you know not up to par generally
i mean

631
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,020
no line nine times out of ten we go
places the reason the default Windows

632
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,920
policy a characters with complex

633
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,530
turned on jiang

634
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:23,020
I'm not taken a picture I

635
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,510
another thing that really important as
the No your adversaries right

636
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,530
so when you're getting a third-party
penetration test you should be

637
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,420
simulating your adversaries

638
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,540
so are they had to miss are they like
you know Chinese teas trying to get your

639
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,800
money or are they

640
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,329
you know like how we gonna simulate the
attack against each other best

641
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:44,790
represent the way the your adversaries
are gonna attack you

642
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:49,849
merging so the next one that we like it
we were talking about earlier

643
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:53,119
one at the top three things this is my
number one hits on every single one is

644
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,160
network segmentation

645
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,089
right so network segmentation is a huge
thing when you think about it

646
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:02,690
within your organization and what we
always try this say is

647
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,339
the break it down to you analyzing

648
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:09,540
where you must critical assets are Amin
people are willing to do for their

649
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,559
cardholder data environment why would
you be willing to do it for an HR

650
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,240
department

651
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,569
you have to do everything at once but
you need to analyze what's there you

652
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:19,790
need to look at your service you look at
your assets

653
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,050
cover resources what these years
actually need to do

654
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,339
and you can even start just with a
nineteen right just within your own

655
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:29,290
department if you or your risk
Department or whatever it is

656
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,089
and what you want to do is you want to
make sure that your site many knows

657
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:32,530
because

658
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:36,510
you know we're all gonna get finished at
some point there's going to be an attack

659
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,380
something but

660
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,349
our goal is to you prevent the
proliferation of that now where

661
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:45,089
as much as we can in order to detect
right that mean that's that's the goal

662
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:47,119
is to stop it long enough that we
recognize it

663
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,339
and I get past my brother defenses so
you really need to look at what your

664
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:54,730
organizations doing with this critical
assets are start small

665
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,780
certainly important new as long as
you're moving forward that's all that

666
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,069
matters if you just look at it go screw
it it's too big it's going to take me 10

667
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:01,500
years

668
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,549
and not gonna do it you'll never get
anywhere

669
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:09,040
don't be defeated up bra at every little
bit as hell

670
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,950
in so here's one that's like a big one

671
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,470
with me is that is that you know I'll

672
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:21,300
all the big organizations nowadays I
mean I just name a few that I know for

673
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,010
sure like Boeing GE couple other

674
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:28,140
a bigger organizations the Lockie that
all have

675
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,700
internal pen testing teams and

676
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,830
they pay internal pen tester salaries
right

677
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:39,370
and so I'm not gonna tronic I'm gonna
try to talk about this and not sound

678
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,480
grandiose but the thing is is that like

679
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,850
the the the a

680
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,380
offensive sorry up

681
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,710
offensive red team type stuff is sexy
and it in high demand right and its paid

682
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,030
really really well right

683
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,310
a lotta times were on the road all the
time I mean there is a high price to pay

684
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,880
however it's a really really well. pain
salary and so a lot of times

685
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,010
a somebody you know such as myself

686
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,860
my get an offer from an organization to
come beyond the blue team which I'd love

687
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,430
to do I'd love to work somewhere

688
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,680
and be on the defensive somewhere and
not travel as much however that

689
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,980
I however the problem is it's not sexy
to be on the blue team right like it's

690
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,550
not

691
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:25,740
it's not a dozen you know it doesn't pay
as well and it doesn't you know have as

692
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,710
many benefits and so I'm shocked when I
go into organizations and they don't

693
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,560
have a pen tester on staff right because

694
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,810
there's no way that you're gonna catch
attackers without having an attack on

695
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,440
staff and when I say a pen tester I mean
somebody that's

696
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,140
actively in the offensive security
community right even though

697
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,620
they might work in a blue team job I'm
not talking about you know somebody that

698
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,220
like

699
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,930
you know work to bounce down like twenty
years ago or something like that in like

700
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:51,780
as there's anything

701
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,329
not that there's a they're all in that
lead

702
00:38:54,329 --> 00:38:57,400
a lousy those eyes as rightful I'll
night you

703
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,019
okay cool we talk bad about them
non-skid cell

704
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:04,299
but something like I really like to her
home in organizations and the reason

705
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:07,650
like I bring this up is because a lot of
times I go into places

706
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,640
Europe and tests and they're like dear
god how can we hire somebody like you to

707
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,519
be on staff

708
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,700
he cuz you could literally right all our
salmon monitoring rules and how this

709
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,990
text up in a couple weeks and I'm like

710
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,710
Payam a competitive salary like I hate
to make it all about money but I mean

711
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,289
like that's part of what it is

712
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:29,279
and sell this is Ben talk a lot a lot
this year

713
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:33,089
dead I mean so crack kinda working from
for us

714
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:37,769
is we and we were doing the Pentastar an
organization about four years ago

715
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:41,720
wrong and their defenses are so badly on
their stock

716
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,660
so we're on their stock computers and I
would say all right martin you attack

717
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,130
and I'm gonna defend and we were
actually

718
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,130
red and blue team in ourselves

719
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,660
back and forth tried to prevent each
other from getting into these different

720
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,359
systems

721
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,180
so so we discover we call ourselves a
purple team at that point but but

722
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,970
honestly

723
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,430
you need that the bass defenders

724
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:08,119
our attackers in the best attackers and
defenders you know once I did that going

725
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:11,509
the other side of the coin comes
naturally as well I know how I'm gonna

726
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,019
attack an organization

727
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:16,099
me as a pen test reason I'm offensive
should have

728
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:20,420
have had great recommendations and
resolution to this customer on their

729
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,180
part comes out

730
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,029
I can tell them exactly what I did and
how to defend specifically against

731
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:31,220
so what one other big thing is you need
to research your ad here

732
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,100
you never know

733
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,390
that who you're gonna get on a pen test
ride

734
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,080
so it's a really II and this isn't a
page from our organization like anybody

735
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,980
else's organization but what i'm saying
is you really got to do your homework

736
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,390
like you can't just hire somebody help

737
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:53,550
because they were on Fox News right you
never know what they might be into

738
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:58,650
cell what i'm saying is spent some time
to research your vendor write something

739
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,180
that also always tried to tell

740
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,540
organizations to do is if you get with a
vendor you trust

741
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,620
on and you have a policy in place to
switch vendors which you should

742
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,110
and never ever recommend staying with
the same pen Desmond are very long

743
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,760
23 years max right ask that Penn

744
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,130
say you know say we were working with
you and you really trusted you know

745
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,670
where I work at ACI my right and we did
your test for a couple years and i was

746
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,490
just talking about

747
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:26,490
somebody with those earlier and we did
your test for a couple years and he said

748
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,930
alright guys I think you you know gone
as far as you can go I'm gonna switch to

749
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,240
another render next year

750
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,120
I you know a bad company is gonna get
pissed off and take their toys and kick

751
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,460
rocks and go home right

752
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,400
a good company is gonna say you know
what that's an excellent idea and here

753
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,780
is 45 other companies that hire really
trust and know people that work at right

754
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,770
and then they're gonna go to one of
those companies and ultimately at some

755
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,930
point they're probably gonna come back
to you so

756
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,820
it's really really important another
reason I like to talk about this on

757
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,080
telephoning story

758
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,540
try not to trying not to bust out the
company but we were at a

759
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,320
we were at a pen test a few years ago
and we were doing their PCI

760
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,840
you know yearly penetration test and
their client was telling us that they

761
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,250
had just lost their

762
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:14,460
back USA and that they were looking for
any QS eight a given their rock

763
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,640
I mean this companies huge like
worldwide was gonna give them the rock

764
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,270
and sell

765
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,530
they were in negotiations with another
company that

766
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,000
you know is pretty well known

767
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,330
and they were trying to get them as the
QS a and the guy in literally

768
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,550
you know called up this see so that you
know that we work on foreign said

769
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,110
you know you can is run down they were
telling them the importance of them

770
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,120
getting the rock by like next day or
something and sell

771
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,320
that guys literally called up there like
all in that case we just got this

772
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,380
questionnaire we can run through all
these questions on will give your rock

773
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,460
over the phone

774
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,690
the large global company I mean

775
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,720
anyway so that type of stuff happens out
there in the world

776
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,960
your invite your thoughts

777
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,540
I got the next she said

778
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:06,580
okay I also gotta be careful and thought
leaders I mean like like I said I mean

779
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,550
like you just never never never know

780
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,760
there are called leaders out there in
the industry and there are people that

781
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,650
are on the news

782
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:17,250
I hate box knees this is CNN but I to
pick on pops news today

783
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,760
Fox News however what I do you like is
that I know that somebody that I know

784
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,400
and trust that is saying the right thing
that Kennedy is out there on Fox News

785
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,710
telling them the right way to go and so
that's really really important and

786
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:32,180
even though I joke about the leaders all
the time like I'm really really thankful

787
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:32,580
that

788
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,060
I'll that we're getting a lot more
exposure in the security industry and

789
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,290
that were able to you

790
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:40,900
get out there on the knees and drop the
right messaging get all these programs

791
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,340
that we're talking about moving forward
in a larger organizations

792
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,850
next your gonna be talking about she
storytellers that's my role

793
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:53,620
so you can protect you don't know about
right we we kinda party touched on this

794
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,630
we did a fantastic where I'll

795
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:00,160
and already turned out to be quick but
we did a pen test where

796
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,110
we I a drop like a pony or something and
we got a shallow and I got on the Fox

797
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,890
and first thing I always do is to look
and see how many routes there are what's

798
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:09,470
going on

799
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:13,780
with this box and we always take
whatever day is like if its last 24 we

800
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,950
always just go one about Desai 16

801
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:20,160
so I found rains like that I had these
boxes and I'm like holy crap that is 10

802
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,780
boxes here I checked and manually
permiso 267 and they were all gonna

803
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,410
bleep of those boxes me on the entire
organization

804
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:31,670
I so we went back to them and they're
like those on our IP addresses in right

805
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:34,180
now I'm pretty sure they are because we
got the

806
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,570
accounts of them that helps us on the
rest the organization so

807
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:41,840
they said well we don't have it in our
DNS been having this at the other thing

808
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,730
and at what had happened was and it was
a plant that was over in europe

809
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:51,120
added close down four years earlier but
no one knew what the servers dead so

810
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,100
when they shut the plant down they just
closed door unlocked it left them

811
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,520
running

812
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,560
but the people back in the states just
remove them from DNS right they didn't

813
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,040
do the active scanning and the repeat
not stop

814
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,520
so we were really really push for

815
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,390
even just going out and letting us do
hosts covering your network

816
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,320
like I said I will sit down with you for
six months in the slashing find

817
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,430
everything that I can

818
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:17,370
any organization and that's why I can be
more valuable to you because you have no

819
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,470
idea what's there

820
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,560
what's now job and it's not something
that sexy

821
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,420
but it's something that's gonna be very
valuable to the organization how can you

822
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,020
defend what you doing at gramm

823
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:33,070
iight so where I'm at Tombo brown talk a
little bit about you know

824
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,190
a blow through these last couple slides
but assessing your maturity model

825
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,320
something that's really

826
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,800
beneficial for this is the Pete as
saying by her to the penetration testing

827
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,060
execution standard

828
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,190
threatened by Penn testers

829
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:48,190
I basically it's sort of a checklist up
for Penn testers

830
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,609
and for organizations getting a pen test

831
00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:55,470
and sell a bring this up to every client
that I work at where

832
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,039
I not only should you be checking to
make sure that I did everything

833
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,619
you know as a pen test as a client you
should be checking in you know all your

834
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:06,099
vendors and making sure that they're
doing a proper penetration testers all

835
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:07,230
outlined in there

836
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,510
Obama's gonna talk about it a little bit
more about but we're short on time but

837
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:15,630
but reading that there's all kinds of
things in there where you can assess the

838
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,940
you know security model is your
organization there's a lotta guidelines

839
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,000
in there were you can decide if you have
a low maturity model

840
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,779
high maturity model is your you know are
you are you doing well

841
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:29,640
where do you need some work I'll and
even I mean you should be only six a

842
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,460
high-level

843
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:34,869
points from each day's that's a lot to
digest specific person per

844
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:38,190
looking out for the first time had even
taken up high level and it's going to

845
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:38,789
your

846
00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:42,309
your yet defenders and also to your
third third party that you're looking to

847
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:45,279
contact with an ask if they do these
things and it's so awsome other

848
00:46:45,279 --> 00:46:46,390
methodologies because

849
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,970
said you know someone who does this
constantly should be able to tell you

850
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,640
exactly at the drop of a hat if you ask
them about

851
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,390
their methodology for internal or
external they should be able to if they

852
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:57,680
can't ban

853
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,710
maybe move on to the next song

854
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,940
so the pee test helps you making sure
you get what you paid for

855
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,809
right and so you know if you're paying
for penetration test you should get a

856
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:11,779
penetration test your pain for
vulnerabilities as me she get a

857
00:47:11,779 --> 00:47:13,359
vulnerability assessment because

858
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,950
I feel bad when I go into organizations
and that paid for a full-scale

859
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,589
penetration test and you know me and
Eric walking

860
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:23,119
front door fine MS 08 67 in a plant
running

861
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,809
you know that's four years old I mean
we're that was like a a week assessment

862
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:28,759
we were literally done on day two

863
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:34,910
because they didn't know what they
needed you know

864
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:38,329
so a lot of times we talk about the
disconnect between all the different

865
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:39,519
groups that exists right

866
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,089
you gotta make sure that I'll

867
00:47:43,089 --> 00:47:46,969
you know for aus its you know account
managers that are selling

868
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:51,049
our services you know we need to educate
to make sure they understand the

869
00:47:51,049 --> 00:47:53,739
difference between a fantastic
reliability assessment that they can

870
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:55,369
show that tied to the customer

871
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:59,450
when its internal it's things like your
processes in place that proper

872
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:00,569
notifications

873
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:04,789
help desk people know what their role is
but they also know everybody else's role

874
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:06,920
is within the organization something's
going on

875
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,249
and there's always kinda the huge
disconnect between all the groups

876
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:12,579
associated with it right we're all silos
like

877
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:16,979
were ready my sister you bleedin guys
were against the rate like that of that

878
00:48:16,979 --> 00:48:18,869
has to go away at this point we need a

879
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:21,240
intermingling

880
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:27,790
I'm alright so here's some things that
you should be getting out a penetration

881
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,820
test right these are the summit the
takeaways that you should be

882
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,390
that she should be walking away with
after the test is done and you know

883
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:37,450
understanding the risks and threats that
you can be back and

884
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,730
how you design and develop network
applications right so this is

885
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:45,950
you taking my report the path of least
resistance and integrating that in your

886
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:47,310
security program

887
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:51,030
understanding in the process of attack
for your particular company

888
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,330
that's not just reading my record and
saying

889
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:58,390
0 snapping a domain admin right it's
understanding

890
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:02,589
every single level love how I got there
and not a lot of organizations go into

891
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:06,460
that much detail I can only put so much
in a report and so many screenshots

892
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,380
right sometimes we need to review

893
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:14,510
you know a in words like how to go over
like how did you do that or why did that

894
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:15,730
happen to run into you

895
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:20,180
that sell I'll you know Boehner
abilities account for that

896
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,530
for the environment network architecture
asset value should be getting

897
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:29,050
you know vulnerability pictures %uh this
try to hurry up

898
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,750
yells start I someone say that last line

899
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,400
smart people could buy an issue that
we're never gonna by the organization

900
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,080
great

901
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,240
want to bring in somebody with a
different mindset I mean even from the

902
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:40,790
same

903
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:44,119
and test company we going behind each
other sometimes

904
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:48,869
or go in behind somebody else and it's a
completely different fantastic customer

905
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:52,869
that was the year before but having all
those different looks at your

906
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:54,150
organization

907
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,609
can can help you understand better but
also make your defenses

908
00:49:57,609 --> 00:50:00,619
or and we do that a lot you know we
always try to send

909
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:04,040
the that dick the clients that we
multiple penthouse for year after year

910
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,180
after year we always runs and the
difference I'll never time because

911
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,369
even though you know I may not have
found everything right my path of least

912
00:50:11,369 --> 00:50:14,940
resistance might have been different had
somebody else's path of least resistance

913
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,200
cell even with the same company render
you can get a different test every year

914
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,040
but if you get the same like Billy Bob
out there every year cuz he takes you

915
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,820
out for drinks

916
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:27,070
spends a lot of money on you I mean like
you're not getting lesion

917
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:32,640
getting I'd so thanks everyone they may
have any questions

918
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:39,640
am we're hiring by the way come seeming

919
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:49,290
or Hall day

920
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:52,800
well

921
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,190
in so I'll be honest

922
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:01,230
in the past four years me and Eric have
only found one company that we think has

923
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:01,480
it

924
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,200
all the way together I wish I could say
their name but unfortunately I can't cuz

925
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,970
they should get the

926
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:11,250
biggest gold star on but just to give
you an idea like

927
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:15,050
I went there two years ago and I spent
four weeks on site

928
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,369
a male literally handed me want to their
computers and said

929
00:51:18,369 --> 00:51:23,430
pretend like you stole this do anything
you can possibly think I've there's no

930
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:24,790
rules whatsoever

931
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,260
and I got zip file and Eric went back

932
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,369
this year and they basically told him
the same thing

933
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:31,920
and

934
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,340
Eric odds about now that's the high end
of the spectrum right cell but there are

935
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,720
some organizations that are doing some
things you know to you

936
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,910
move forward along that path the biggest
one that I see is network segmentation

937
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,870
right if I can't get to it

938
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:51,440
then i cant penetrate their rights are
network segmentation is one of the

939
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,710
biggest and unfortunately that's one of
the biggest

940
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:58,440
undertakings but you know currently like
this year the whole responder that BIOS

941
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,830
thing is really popular in like
everybody's is rolling in

942
00:52:01,830 --> 00:52:05,970
using the net bias attack passing around
some credentials getting domain admin

943
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,790
and it's game over on day one

944
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:12,990
and then we suggest to the client
disabling a BIOS they're like home my

945
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,560
god we got all these like

946
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,850
applications that needed in like they
just don't even know what to do you

947
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:21,750
write like it's a disaster like cuz they
couldn't even conceive turning off net

948
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,500
buyers but

949
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,050
but the company's where we've been
tested and and they've actually taken

950
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,240
our remediation

951
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,250
on their several that I've been acting
this year that have completely disable

952
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,120
net BIOS

953
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:36,320
lol men are know all that type of stuff
over the network so those type of things

954
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,040
are working

955
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,640
it's a pain in the ass but individual
passwords

956
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,910
for every I local admin account I'll

957
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,340
disabled W digest there's a KB more

958
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:51,090
yet disabling W digest it's basically
getting

959
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:55,030
basically the organizations that I see
that our that are mitigating their

960
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,760
windows environmental organizations that
got a pen test from a good company where

961
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,470
they actually used all the windows

962
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,910
features cheating escalator in the
environment they paid attention to the

963
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,130
report and they went through one by one

964
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:11,900
you know I mean and it's a long process
right it's not like you can just turn

965
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,900
off now by us in your organization you
gotta do it over here you gotta testing

966
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,830
gotta make sure

967
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:21,040
but but for the people that say I got
all the legacy applications online

968
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,690
cool lets were network segmentation
comes in right let's put those

969
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:27,839
applications way over here and disabled
in BIOS on everything else there's a lot

970
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,140
of solutions but

971
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:33,270
you know it's only it's only companies
that pay attention and mitigate some

972
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:37,290
but but but mitigating Windows features
is pretty much the

973
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:41,970
most important thing and I would like to
say one thing about that company because

974
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:45,670
unfortunately the guys who run it
probably will never get the kid is a

975
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:46,829
deserving

976
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:50,359
but everything they did they did for
with 3

977
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:53,690
tools that already existed locker and
actor

978
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:57,750
two guys this isn't it's not a huge
multinational company but it's enough

979
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,230
for us to use as a measuring stick and
saying

980
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,280
you say you can't do this but these guys
did it and it scales

981
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,530
them it can be done and the

982
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:09,550
the other thing that I wanted to say
about those guys was

983
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:13,680
you know very humble great guys that
were just

984
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,119
able to really take something and get by
and from the higher ups

985
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:22,030
and that's important right he'll have
that by and that understanding

986
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:26,950
and that trust you never gonna get it
yep make it happen but it was just an

987
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:28,020
incredible experience

988
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,010
on Stephen I was a complete and utter
failure on my part it taught me a lot of

989
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:32,520
things that

990
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,059
all people just can't say I can't do
that anymore

991
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:39,569
it was a one time we were happy fail any
more questions I'll

992
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:46,569
yes so the question is out all the pen
test that I do how many companies

993
00:54:50,109 --> 00:54:53,839
really need a pen test i'd I'd probably
say 34 southern

994
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,770
were not ready for me to come I we 75
percent

995
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,589
I wouldn't have considered ready that's
just my opinion of course I mean

996
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:06,859
but but but like I said to add those 75
percent the company's I would say that

997
00:55:06,859 --> 00:55:07,640
they had

998
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,059
a fairly simple vulnerability that I
didn't have to

999
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:14,859
you know that I didn't have to work for
and that was fairly well known and

1000
00:55:14,859 --> 00:55:17,710
should have been caught by a police
demand and

1001
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:20,940
and probably just wasn't because they
didn't know about it right

1002
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,960
that thing is is that the thing is is
that I wake up every morning and I'm

1003
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,650
reading you know exploit database and
i'm looking for the newest you know I'm

1004
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:32,250
on mailing lists in like so I'm on like
you know the cutting

1005
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:36,049
you know edge of what's happening every
day publicly ride

1006
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:41,910
thought leader yasser miss but a hacer
but I guess what I'm saying is that like

1007
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,279
if I was in a blue team defensive
position

1008
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:47,510
each I would slack up on that kinda
stuff because it wouldn't be as

1009
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,329
important to me because I wouldn't be
used in everyday on the

1010
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:54,809
on the on offense and so what happens is
that at some point you're bleeding this

1011
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,890
doesn't know when they're not in the
know anymore right so

1012
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:01,940
so that happened so I I definitely say
only 75 percent could have benefited

1013
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:02,450
from

1014
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:07,290
some other type of assessment first
doctors treating

1015
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:11,200
well

1016
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,670
that was neither one of us there was
neither one of us

1017
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:19,320
we didn't get shit now we got to drive
for Ari's

1018
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,440
we didn't get to go out for ours and
Wales

1019
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,860
yessir young

1020
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:32,400
year a

1021
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,810
I mean it doesn't care right so when we
going to paint as we know within about

1022
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,700
five minutes after talking to the
customer at they're really serious about

1023
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,760
what we're about to do

1024
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,070
and undertake and we have great people

1025
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:47,550
that we do consult with who are really
excited to have us in there they know

1026
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,800
we're gonna bring value and the fiction

1027
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:55,360
I can tell you all my repeat customers

1028
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,420
only one adult

1029
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,400
probably fiber 600 action he standout as

1030
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,380
I'm every year they're getting better
and again

1031
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:10,340
that's not a lot of times I don't get to
repeat but we get to see the reports but

1032
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:15,500
I can think up more where I did a
three-year susman on where I on them

1033
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,510
every single year

1034
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:19,680
on the same system same vulnerability
has been reported all times

1035
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,350
that's more calm and I think that people
actually we're meeting stop

1036
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:28,320
or paper mediated the super-low stuff
like hey we don't have SSL key to any

1037
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:28,900
more

1038
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:33,950
for something where the CEO rat in some
magazine that this had to be thanks

1039
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,640
anything but for the most part now and
it's usually

1040
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,230
that's a person we doing a back injury
look into it does it there'd netted nine

1041
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,650
times out and there

1042
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,860
and it's interesting that you say that
because that falls in line sorta with

1043
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,200
what we're talking about is that

1044
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,260
when that happens when I go into an
organization there like yeah you know

1045
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,570
what we just didn't really fix anything
and I'm like

1046
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:56,930
no shit I can tell you know then what I
like to do is say

1047
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:00,700
you basically we're ready for a sec here
pen to select backup

1048
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:05,400
and figure out why you didn't get this
stuff for mediated right and so

1049
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,430
because most of the time it's not the
team's fault you know he probably opened

1050
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,620
taking a tar-like

1051
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,930
emailed somebody year did whatever he
was supposed to do for his process but

1052
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:18,120
then there was a breakdown in the
process the ticket didn't get approved

1053
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,110
the Windex guys said it was bullshit and
I never talked to on or whatever so I

1054
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,340
like to go back

1055
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:27,630
and back up and say hey one only use
this time to go over where the breakdown

1056
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:31,460
in your remediation processes and see if
we can identify that and help fix that

1057
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,230
rather than

1058
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:37,230
waste and another 50k on a pen tester
whatever and if we really feel like they

1059
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:41,490
they're interested in and you know up
front we will always ask them to you

1060
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:45,580
if I find something you know or you know
here's a specific one really knows what

1061
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,150
I can do with that happen you know

1062
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:50,390
how would you like me to write it out
right because I want to make sure that

1063
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:51,850
they get to fixing

1064
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:55,840
right in the and our job is to help make
their job easier

1065
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,710

10:00 saying
