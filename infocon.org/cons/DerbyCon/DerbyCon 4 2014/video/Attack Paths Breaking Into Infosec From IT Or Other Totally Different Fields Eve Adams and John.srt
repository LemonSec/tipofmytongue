59
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,549
so what we can talk about here's is
break it down into three acts

60
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,629
and the second act is the center but
more dramatic act

61
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,950
as um first offer it we're going to talk
about

62

big place

where you need to focus your attention
for at least getting witnesses or

69
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,019
what you need to stop doing what you
need to start doing and really narrowing

try to help you get some direction Obama
to talk peace of God

144
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,540
at a time some the best resources

145
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,140
for learning specific around seven for a
sec are the ones that people like us

146
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,959
have actually bothered to put together
and teach to the public

147
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,370
or have our website to the public on
because we found that generally stuff

148
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,339
that's out there

149
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,910
isn't good enough and people like just
mcrae

150
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,070
my Mar carry have have gone ahead and
put together things that

151
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,940
you can take if you'll try if you wanna
learn basic similar analysis

152
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,140
value basics a iPhone 4s

153
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,690
there's lani really good free or
inexpensive class is out there that

154
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,110
these people put together

155
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,430
like I said because I just felt the
material there wasn't good enough

156
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,540
so definitely definitely those are big
plus

157
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,700
ask around before you pay for one

158
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,040
is 41 sure it's legit because

159
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,660
unfortunately this industry's loading

160
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,990
this latest trying to you Chur

161
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,430
was your unemployed watch later daytime
TV see the commercials for getting

162
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,670
you're in for a sec degree through the
mail and

163
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,600
this just you can you can also get your
degree in taxidermy

164
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,190
or tax preparation I'm all kinds of
things

165
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,279
for information security a huge

166
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,709
a huge gap by CH which is its in time
huge plus for getting your foot their

167
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,240
doors learning to code

168
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,570
and that doesn't mean learning to be a
coder up and down

169
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,100
you don't have to know 16 languages you
don't have to be a program because

170
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,329
you're trying to be a

171
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,970
you don't have to be one of those
developers that sabers Potter hit so

172
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,850
much

173
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,480
yeah you're just learn the idea of
coding

174
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,899
the basic supporting the concept of
telling what coating is what the floor

175
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,339
coating is how it works

176
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:16,410
and learn learn it least you get
basically familiar

177
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,040
with at least two languages hit be able
to write more than a whole

178
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,209
a hello world program and one of them

179
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:27,579
and pick languages that are being use

180
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:31,490
still whole yes don't don't focus

181
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,079
six hours on-call and mine for

182
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,269
a day 6 hours a day brent Barry farms

183
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:42,350
yeah that's how we're going to get
beeped up here was that

the hard way learn whatever hype

201
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,880
see the list come Internet resource

202
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,720
many people saw the excesses and I'll
launch reasons two weeks ago

203
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,690
that guy did you watch it wasiyu yeah

204
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,940
with me excesses miles a really cool
website

205
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,389
where you learn to code by the the you
get instructions

206
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:08,610
on it's just like last you get taught
new things and how to code and then

207
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,860
you're given exercises users new things
and as well as

208
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,660
the old the things already learned but
what school is once you complete your

209
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,550
program you submit your code

210
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,420
and a bunch of people review your co a
bunch for professionals in the industry

211
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,139
a volunteer to

212
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,950
be on that side of the fence practices
but I'll except you don't need any

213
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,220
credibility

214
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,220
are I don't know what's going on with
you idea

215
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,730
are my my cousin yet so in what's cool
about that is no comeback ago

216
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,360
yeah that does work however which you
should on here and we're here to make it

217
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,459
more efficient is this

218
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,920
this math and see you not just learning
to code not learning

219
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,300
how how the syntax works and how suber
genes work in a specific language

220
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,639
you actually learning how to be an
efficient coder and thats that's a huge

221
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,660
deal

222
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,899
issue carries a big deal so I liked the
idea texas is it that I or lot

223
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,260
I'm with them by

224
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,399
everything we're talking about this very
its

225
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,040
that nothing in this talk requires one
dime

226
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,170
and that's part A what we're trying to
convey that you can literally

227
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,690
educate yourself for free you can
literally get into this industry for

228
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,209
free

229
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,250
don't have to pony up thousands of
dollars like

230
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,620
you may be Houston yeah so I a gotta

231
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,019
I'm not gonna go through every ball
point in every slide that was added

232
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:27,970
because people were complaining that

233
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,029
they didn't like to take notes one thing
you

234
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,240
and so here something the slide um

235
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,410
let's talk about city on CL 11 one of
the biggest my and my personal favorite

236
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,279
Whalen is

237
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,889
is CGS capture the flag how many people
do in CTF you today

238
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,329
god damn you people get out there do it
yeah the

239
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:52,010
honestly its its the past it's the most

240
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,360
real-world way that you can get some
actual hands-on knowledge

241
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,639
for the way that things actually work
CTS

242
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,360
are the best anything think if you're
not going to see saying

243
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,180
I I don't know nothing you see yep I'm
not going to win the Cy

244
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,790
well most people run marathons don't go
they run to jazz

245
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,190
the quick goat is a quiet finished it
and

246

if you like have anything sayer to or I
can just

271
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,560
don't know enough you don't know enough
that has something to say about that

272
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,740
no absolutely not absolutely anyone and
inist if there's no possibility of the

273
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,690
camper to speak

274
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,269
that's all webber's CTS should

275
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,860
should run the entire gamut a very basic
easy SQL injection

276
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,120
all the way up to you have to write your
own Android malware

277
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,160
orders of his 3,000 points

278
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,069
puzzle yeah also that's not what's going
on at that city's three thousand point

279
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,740
pas although

280
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,890
don't go down that path and spend all
day reverse engineering something in

281
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,669
writing on our forum that's that

282
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:23,910
yeah i i kno so I

283
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,419
could tell stories all day I know people
who are

284
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,490
dot and developers for like I'm and
developers

285
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,610
security people hate me they're also
mean they hate have

286
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,020
I could not possibly contribute anything
right

287
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,130
and they comin there's a dot mad her
ability challenge and I like oh I got

288
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,320
this and all that

289
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,990
you know stock up security people are
like though we didn't know what that was

290
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,059
and yes the developer fixes it or a
completely non technical people

291
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:56,770
just a Sasaki our social engineering
challenge

292
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,429
and yeah just getting to it from ask
questions

293
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:03,750
yeah and it's great and once you get
this deal

294
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,799
you get your confidence up and then you
try something harder and yours

295
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,780
you tried something maybe only salt
forms the spend all saturday

296
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,500
on number four because something you
didn't understand once you got number

297
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,820
four

298
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,950
probably learned a whole lot of stuff
you didn't know on Friday

299
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,990
and thats lickable stuff that you at
night I just

300
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,559
our last I case study I am

301
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,840
probably police technical person in this
room

302
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,360
worker I don't know anything I but I do
have a linguistics degree and

303
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,330
on ya no challenge a piece I citrate
lester I gotta

304
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,100
like I seconds while the sky was
literally tearing out a little

305
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,140
turkey at lot South everybody has
something to contribute to dinner

306
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,110
as let's let's talk a little bit about
getting

307
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:58,110
collapse the

308
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,850
and a an

309
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,960
however sophisticated humor China
Christmas

310
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,190
engineering John can you do this lives
here

311
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,210
it'll be great totally professional

312
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,919
as worry 15 minutes in and first toilet
Joe

313
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,080
that decisions iPad for 500

314
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,970
so from I know that

315
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,860
who works in the IT industry right now

316
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,150
most the vast majority view how many
have you heard

317
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,929
are IT equipment pakrats just

318
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:40,169
if it still works why when I throw it
out yeah

319
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:43,590
still the majority I'm

320
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,679
because we love this stuff we love to
have it we know

321
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,929
either we're gonna need it one day or we
just love to take her with it

322
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,700
and and its greats and we love to play
with things will play technology

323
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,220
that's the big plays right see a lot of
people who spoke is when they're trying

324
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,919
to learn security

325
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,720
is they wanna get their hands on all
those things or they want to just use

326
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,250
the things they have anyone I really
really really dive deeply into

327
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,940
into this this firewall when and then
they're not spending any time anything

328
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,500
else

329
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,010
or the spending it on workings weird
obscure equipments or

330
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:20,830
setting up an asterisk box which takes
the better part of the year

331
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,450
if you're me and and and and not
actually learning something that's gonna

332
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,230
be viable

333
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,590
I N and another by the problem is some
sick just

334
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,929
cost money is cost prohibitive you know
you're not

335
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:38,610
super-rich in for a sec guys like here

336
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,770
and so I I tried to put together here
what

337
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,230
i think is most cost effective
minimalist lab

338
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:51,500
for really getting at nice well rounded

339
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,940
system to educate yourself with hardware
wise if you need a little bit hardware

340
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,559
and it's really cool these days most
things ritualized Joan you need less

341
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,610
hardware now

342
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,990
you those hurt were now than he did when
I gave this talk in the spring

343
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,350
and that's really cool because more
unisons

344
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,900
we've talked a lot of people were like
we have no boxes whatsoever it's all

345
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,049
virtualized

346
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,549
I'd come at is how doable a

347
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:19,909
easels it it's actually the more
virtualize become the more complicated

348
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:22,980
the harder it is to get to that point
but what's really cool

349
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,280
at that point you're learning ESXi
relearning him where so it's

350
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,860
its it's not assert that idea like here
I say

351
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,980
you know get yourself like one Cisco
switch

352
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,520
one Cisco router juniper school to this
jennifer is

353
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,330
as huge distribution as well but the two
different operating systems and

354
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,299
noble those s that's really here to pick
one goat cheese

355
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:48,470
yes im shops um there's Cisco actually
has a program called

356
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,360
was GGSN 3GS three

357
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,679
gns3 jenis 3 which virtualize is

358
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:00,450
every piece Cisco hardware that's out
there it does cost money

359
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,780
but what's really cool is then you don't
even have to have any hardware

360
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,039
except for you know probably art were
switched just

361
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,179
connect all your stuff up to you but you
can even go that far in gns3 runs

362
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,970
all the Cisco losses for all their
hardware and so you're still getting

363
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,710
that real

364
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,570
world experience with all that but you
don't have a noisy

365
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,299
in your house well get get an access
point that's not

366
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,350
dealing links is access point

367
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,950
cuz you trying to work the other the
wings is one super easy to stand up

368
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,090
get going but get something up

369
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,390
a alike were here I get something off
the horse WP West

370
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,250
a.m. that's the the or CP certification
for wireless

371
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,390
and they have a list a access points
that will allow you to feel

372
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,789
past him she's bill passed the
certification

373
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:53,309
if you use one of these and so read one
of their list because

374
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:56,970
you got it then you got another
certification that's really is lol just

375
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,340
google

376
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,390
a.m. yeah I cheap network tap

377
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,659
really necessary but it can be running
out you want to set the network

378
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:09,409
as far as getting this equipment you
going forward

379
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:15,270
thousand dollars Cisco are two hundred
thousand dollar gym for outerwear if you

380
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,640
start around it

381
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,880
like the entire reason see burgers yeah
shit

382
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,610
onto that book you a you don't need the
top of the line current

383
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,750
modern equipment absolutely you need

384
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,919
three year old equipment 35 year old
equipment and that is all

385
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,490
over it day the base bill with that
because companies get rid of this stuff

386
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,750
after three to five years because that's
when you know support contracts upper

387
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,640
that's on the company's

388
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,669
not stop supporting this um

389
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:45,880
and it ends up money because I like
watching it through in the dumpster I

390
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,429
can get

391
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:50,620
300 bucks for this five bucks for sport
it does end up in a dumpster what it is

392
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,080
it's

393
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,900
the network admins fishing it back out
and putting an app VV to make a couple

394
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,150
bucks in their pocket she's

395
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,010
very common you should be what's going
on the other option is i ts

396
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,150
recovery firms seems like a really weird
professional name

397
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,409
buddies to work for one and they'll sell
you know they'll sell

398
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:10,610
a thirty to make sticker Rams anybody
knocks on the door

399
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,320
you're just like I have four dollars
connection RAM and there's

400
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,590
here cool whatever it so just Google
that phrase

401
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,900
in your area look it up on google maps
I'll

402
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,990
I didn't list any because the

403
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,409
I always North Chicago area score points
they're out there

404
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:30,610
the recently yeah the reason we talk so
much about labs

405
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,799
as a worker any good recruiter any good
hiring manager

406
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,500
in security is going to ask what are you
doing on her own

407
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,600
lot of be doing on her own on skype

408
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,700
lives some workers I know

409
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,890
scallop like where's your ch

410
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,049
nation where's CISSP ally

411
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:56,080
I yelled screens about

412
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,799
that issuing is toxic

413
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,470
suffice it to say people who

414
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,120
what each performance wanna know what
yitzhak

415
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,010
really like not for sheepskin not for a
piece of paper

416
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,650
what do you do on your own not just does
it display

417
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,710
passion interests this CIR

418
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,929
it's not just who I heard this money and
security like birds

419
00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:27,299
he's crying but it shows here

420
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:31,049
on the Pauls I'll say on our abilities

421
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:35,289
explains going on out wild and that
applies even

422
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:38,370
to those you're already working sure to
get a new job

423
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,620
you have finger on the pulse cuz
industries train

424
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,190
you're running soon as you stop learning
stopped running

425
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:50,309
the trains run you down and then your
gonna be an analyst rest your life

426
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:53,929
it it out since Aug analysts like want
to move up in your

427
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:57,450
sugar and that's usually what happens I
see these guys and I see all the time

428
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,950
I'm just up learning at one point they
are just

429
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,240
to an IRA base I are all day

430
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,279
sky

431
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,779
got his degree in it was good for 57 10
years

432
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:13,990
knowledge back when educations while

433
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,799
and the antidote to that is having a lab

434
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:23,169
shipping South and see the same
sentiment is a CTF like

435
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:26,429
passion that's the concert were trying
to get across years to be able to show

436
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:30,419
look I have a passion this to the point
where I take my personal time

437
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,700
and I do this stuff I did as I'm not
getting and you don't you don't have to

438
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,590
be the best at it

439
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,570
you don't have to be gotta TSX nobody's
expecting that for an entry-level

440
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,299
position

441
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:41,350
the be weird came up in like I'm ESXi
God

442
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,059
what will be playing for the score

443
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:49,150
so it in the the don't get overwhelmed
by what we're telling you to do what you

444
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,120
have to learn here

445
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,470
what we're telling you you have the
knows how this stuff works

446
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,650
and how to make it work with everything
else in this

447
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,850
stuff I and again that's enough that's
cool enough to

448
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:05,230
spur for people to go all right this
this this person we clearly teach things

449
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,770
think they give a crap because you can
you can you can teach a monkey to do

450
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,870
most anything given a longer period of
time

451
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,400
but you can't you can't she just want
you to care about it

452
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,179
security is very Merida craddock
cultured how we talk about people who

453
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:19,500
are

454
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,679
the whose sites and its

455
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:28,580
very easy to feel like everybody's all
the people were better than you are

456
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,880
better than you because they

457
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,529
soft free years because they

458
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:36,830
failed for you years nothin teaches

459
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,669
like failure so get out there and felt I
encourage you to pass

460
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:46,929
give it up for failure the

461
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:50,360
so and one point to another point on the
hardware's

462
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,870
if you do if your virtualizing things
which you should be I'm

463
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,580
stand up in ESXi server you don't need a
three thousand dollar

464
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,210
el boss to do this you can do it on a
powerful

465
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,740
desktop machine probably have one you
probably know how to build one

466
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,340
on the cheap because people doing
purists

467
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,360
you it doesn't have to be a serious
enterprise boxing

468
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,630
scores you don't need 128 RAM

469
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,679
you just need something with with

470
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,549
a fast enough this to be had a lot of
the I only you're gonna be doing with

471
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:28,100
the security event management coming
through there I do highly recommend SSD

472
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,820
this that know there's you don't have to
you can find small cheap scuzzy this

473
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,559
or bills and if you really want that
work

474
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:42,330
and against go back to looking for cheap
hardware it's out there

475
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,590
your figure it out while you're setting
that up

476
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,970
up your VM should be you should have a
separate p.m. for each

477
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,840
each realm where each set of
applications some each application

478
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,080
trying to learn like please don't steal
them from her

479
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,020
and I'll get into specific applications
later but you need enough RAM to handle

480
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,250
running that they owe us is on a box
that's alright RAM is cheap

481
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,520
and then one you're setting those up in
the

482
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,870
because you've got all these different
OS's doing different things

483
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:16,610
I'm work I P tables set up I P table
specifically for what that 1 p.m. is

484
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,020
doing

485
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,130
setup se1 extra specifically at 10 just
accept that a false

486
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,779
because Linux administration is she you

487
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:28,080
must European said histories its

488
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,529
unfortunately ariel X field so if you
come in to go analytics administration

489
00:29:32,529 --> 00:29:33,020
in nineteen

490
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,830
basic stuff like IP tables like user
administration

491
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:41,020
like all the major binaries Rogers that

492
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,640
p that that is actually impressive as
its soul

493
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,809
rare that people come in with now I'm in
eight years

494
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:51,990
but I will build a shrine to any got you
want me to

495
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:58,200

507
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,210
don't care environments systems
administration

508
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:49,210
map lines should not kept way

509
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,700
miss the community timing on the slide
start sorry

510
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,169
it's the wrong slide I next slide now
that's the rockslide

511
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:00,960
K to get slide fag

512
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,710
Eric %uh she got it I can take out there
against developer Lauren

513
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,029
the

514
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:15,010
I think that slide is only really funny
us

515
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:20,429
okay um this guy is is a I do turn up on

any writers in here

518
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:30,779
it's it's it's the worst response ever
gotten a question

519
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:36,320
or the past but you the heavy I gots
rapid a and so what

520
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,390

521
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,549
GTFO any post that a whole bunch of pics

524
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:48,940
hotdogs

525
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,779
it that's guy that's been out of the
fridge

526
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:56,019
I your art so anyway

527
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:59,580
it was the best picture I could think up
for this title and I apologize it's

528
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,669
totally inapplicable

529
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,479
yeah picture not related for you people

530
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:10,200
so the main things that I really think
that you should be running in PM's

531
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,879
on your server for learning things are
listed over there on that

532
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:17,009
let Lev on the left

533
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:21,289
it's not hers action

534
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:25,099
percent a and in one of my favorites

535
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:29,779
that just came out recently his security
in security onion

536
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:34,029
a among other things has a prepackaged
bro I D S

537
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:37,450
built into their and bro i ts grad

538
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,539
it it's rad its it's the bees

539
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:43,789
and a bro ideas coupled with by

540
00:32:43,789 --> 00:32:47,639
your favorites ever ever Gration engine
I love

541
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:51,479
a elastic search but Splunk is cool too

542
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:55,769
us plug has more a foothold in the
industry but elastic search is very much

543
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:56,599
up and coming

544
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:00,539
I mean if you learn elastic search you
get the idea how that stuff works you

545
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:02,570
can apply to spot just love this place
in

546
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,479
test porches want is more common
eigenvalue

547
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:10,820
valuable knowledge that I'm and so and
what we're talking about here is an

548
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,499
intrusion detection system

549
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:17,190
that monitors all your you feel your
network traffic into it and it looks for

550
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,079
weird things

551
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,869
looks for now and it sides of alerts to
users

552
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:25,499
here's an anomaly she do something about
this and you go crawl

553
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:28,729
I get to do with being and then you get
to look at that anomaly

554
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:31,820
read up on what that anomaly is and why
it's important white happens and then

555
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,679
you get to go into your network traffic
in

556
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,139
find it Donnelly going to let you know
how boring network monitoring actually

557
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:43,289
yeah just some people up

558
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:47,249
weird yeah and then what you doing it
you actually

559
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:51,229
your you doing active hunting you doing
real time and how you doing the exact

560
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,279
analysis you're going to be doing in
that

561
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,529
junior base analyst job Flickr saying

562
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:59,749
you're doing something for free and too
tired scared

563
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:03,129
something literally to

564
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:06,829
pay for invest all that much time and
hansen's

565
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:09,980
you can invest the time to time love it
just on

566
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,669
its point damnit and and what you doing
theirs are getting real world experience

567
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:19,759
this is this is your answer to how can I
get a job doing InfoSec when I don't

568
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:21,289
have any experience to aim for a sec

569
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:26,299
and when I when I put on my resume when
I don't have any

570
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:29,470
in for a sec experience here's

571
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:33,429
I'm doing in my lap you go I have a year

572
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:37,129
experience running bro ideas with
elastic search and they're gonna go over

573
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:39,259
to get that experience we're working at
Walmart

574
00:34:39,259 --> 00:34:42,619
its weird and you're gonna go I got my
lab at home and they're gonna go

575
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:46,049
tell us about your lap and then you're
gonna get all excited and so much 11

576
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:46,619
gonna go

577
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:50,500
an those girls really cool believe it or
not this is real

578
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,119
believe it or not recruiters and I'm not
down

579
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:57,539
I'm i'm aware. recruiter because I give
a shit about

580
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:01,619
technology and I give a shit about
security and must us down

581
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,740
and I have a break between Myers must
facts on

582
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,950
up even workers without a grant winners

583
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:14,799
hiring managers the specifically more
technical they are the batter

584
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:18,809
by people do you look for that there's
this

585
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:22,259
mentality that you have to be getting
paid to do something

586
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:26,049
in order for it to count his experience
as

587
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:29,420
screw that when he done without just
check that out

588
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,589
when i interview people first inner

589
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,779
first interview very early in the first
interview wanna buy me

590
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:38,890
questions is always tell us what songs
you got home

591
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:42,140
you run it at home what you doing at
home something but %um thats

592
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,410
it's very important because it shows
like in you get

593
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,740
you get people with tons of experience
coming in

594
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,359
they don't have anything at all I really
try to keep are just come up

595
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,430
I'll is all that tells me

596
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,009
you really have a love story and and
that's cool

597
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:03,190
if your company's doesn't wanna boys who
look at what they do

598
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,730

00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,809
PF sense is a firewall you can run in
the AM

613
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:01,980
that teaches you all your great fire
wall mechanics

614
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,190
really it's a good idea what a firewall
is an is not

615
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:09,000
the teacher did you learn the difference
between a firewall and ideas

616
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,150
which Suri people don't understand

617
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,480
and a no-decision why that is as not a
lot of people are

618
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,759
doing IDS author comcast modem in their
house

619
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:23,130
do it and that's what I'm sayin like
people go well

620
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,509
how much was to do I D S and and do
traffic monitoring

621
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:29,759
just a good ado with the comcast modem

622
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:32,900
like you have tons of traffic going
through that morning you

623
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,119
don't know about I promise you don't
know about

624
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,130
check it out you're gonna find a lotta
stuff you didn't want to find

625
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,759
because I come get some money and you're
gonna go to bounce a rabbit holes

626
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:49,630
and you're gonna learn it honest up and
it's going to be great

627
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,849
um Kali doesn't know what Kelly is

628
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:57,079
okay weekend I think we gloss over that
then

629
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,700
was it was there one person okay you
gonna run Kelly

630
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,869
a point of noting that Halle is not
meant to be

631
00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:08,039
a a defaults destroy its not cements the

632
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:12,339
your main distro that you're using as
your desktop OS

633
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:17,210
its not for that at all its it using is
this type of break

634
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,079
because you have to break a lot of
things in in in order to make it work

635
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:20,770
for you

636
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:24,079
T don't don't stop stop using it

637
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,119
stop using Kallis best

638
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,220
there's plenty of other just just go
ahead and used a B

639
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,609
um you're gonna need to set up a Windows
server on their

640
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:39,099
there's that is not something you're
attacking I know it sounds weird

641
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:42,230
but you need you know when it's needed
no Active Directory

642
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:45,770
you need to know how to set up a don't
how to me management in Windows works

643
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:46,279
because

644
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:50,470
every company on earth uses Windows
simpson manager Danny

645
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:54,260
everybody uses Active Directory

646
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,950
hello folks this I E sadly my FB

647
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,050
capture device decided the crap out this
point so

648
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:04,150
live audio and video rose up and

649
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,910
the best this hawk sense is going to be
the slight unfortunately

650
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,700
sorry for the technical difficulties any
excess the parrot post slight out there

651
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,140
where you can see them eat what in that
pic always

652
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,600
in the video and so it can be in some
accounts aren't here

653
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,860
got a way to make that makes a little
bit more reliable
