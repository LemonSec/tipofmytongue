in the nineties system administrator all
that

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,450
I'll eight years ago my wife and I

jobs what should we do

44
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,400
I work I was them vice president a
banking company

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,019
and I said for ITSO I can't thank Rep

46
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,090
for Packers right we should be hackers

47
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,090
and we quit our jobs and the economy

48
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,290
when the crap and somehow ten years
later we're still here

49
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,640
so I am I am a security practitioner

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,129
I'm always a little intimidated coming
up in talking because

51
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,489
you even like the shell-shocked when
we're driving here from San Luis

52
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,260
we're just like then a one of my guys
just

53
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,040
twittering you know the Twitter feed his
in you're just like me

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,670
the skies danger zone and we don't have
time

55
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,569
everything I talk about this stuff I
actually have found this is not

56
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:29,730
hypothetical

57
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,019
in a lab this is actually the first talk
I ever devised

58
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,670
before I started looking at it so if you
have questions I'm not gonna give you

59
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,799
stuff the social hypothetically this
works

60
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,319
this is stuff I am seen out there like a
mission were ethical hackers

61
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,400
I mean what's better in life then

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,090
working in a book above a bar wearing
shorts everyday

63
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,230
with your dogs and just being able to
say I get to be a kid for a living

64
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,569
yeah and right but a crappy reports

65
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:04,760
we also do forensics I'm I put this in

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,450
this is important I am 42 states in the
Union

67
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,700
if you are doing forensics or if someone
is doing forensics

68
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,070
and they are not a licensed PI they're
committing a felony

69
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,160
in a state of Missouri one year in jail

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
why do I mention us who he deals with
PSI's

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,330
the bank you may know what defines PCI

72
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,669
have a little piece okay understand that
if you ever to preach just two deals

73
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:34,440
appear 5

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,440
not in we cannot figure out who these
companies are not a single one of them

75
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,180
have any PI licenses

76
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,320
in in the state which means not only are
they committing felonies

77
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,419
it means any evidence they use is not
held up in a court of law

78
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:55,419
make sure that you have this and finally
an instructor

79
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,090
I am we have the same here and reading

80
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,650
k1 okay

81
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,000
this is going to be a a pg-13

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,539
I I could make it a XXX but

83
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:14,389
what I do you have for you i've a hacker
used hack so the parts right tell you to

84
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:15,710
cover your head with this

85
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,460
fact have a couple extra to

86
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,050
I am when I started this a

87
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,320
again we started as hackers

88
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,310
and I have to complain this is like a
nap

89
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,930
this is like AAA for hackers I'm a
former

90
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,690
ec-council CI K it paid the bills

91
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,220
I'm sorry I had to do it it paid the
bills but the thing was is

92
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,909
I was heated boot camps I'm like the
teachers everything

93
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:52,130
about the book but you go hey howdy just
her life and I can arm but but each were

94
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,020
class so

95
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,470
the other owner of my company is my wife

96
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,009
my boss right we all know that um

97
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,530
and she's like we'll just do it the way
you do it so we do have for you

98
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,800
I am we do to south we still do some

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,969
sir classes but we don't do the same way
word for creating our own

100
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:16,289
2015 part of a set certifications

101
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,779
are boring lights as a community star
building training

102
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,389
teaches you stuff now counts so that's
what we do

103
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,520
like a sir founder parameter security

104
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,889
a my boss is my wife I'm so

105
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,050
she's a short little redhead like this
has no soul

106
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,740
she's a ginger and I'm she's very loud
that's why she's not here to talk over

107
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,550
everybody

108
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,080
and the best part is I don't have to fix
stuff any

109
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,520
ago when I go here's your crap you too
hun

110
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,750
has been way too many years and tech
support but it we can sit on bust

111
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,789
are I'm let's start with the best

112
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:55,130
slide in history data loss right

113
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,699
we are seeing this we know what this
means

114
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:01,729
I just like going to like executive
talks

115
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:04,889
ingestion ago men ladies

116
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:09,020
you see the problem now fix it can walk
off like a boss

117
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,310
you know what does this tell us

118
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,680
jack shit really but no

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,750
but here's the problem people use the
same in Brooklyn

120
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,750
it looks like breaches are to bed we all
know

121
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,300
it's not getting worse we just know
people are going better detecting a

122
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,469
and reno you know FBI did a survey ten
years ago

123
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:35,460
one to two percent are actually bridges
rrrr bridges are actually detected

124
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,360
ares is that number up and what exactly
is a bridge

125
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,130
and for years ago he said I'm more
worried about Trojan than anything

126
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,400
I people go eat we want to talk about
something new pic

127
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,979
target came out video and likes it there
on ago

128
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,210
him by the use malware but they won't
talk about it

129
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,229
because what where hackers after anybody
forehead

130
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:05,229
weird data I don't want who was a

131
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,229
I don't watch nope sorry that's why I

132
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:15,339
don't play baseball the heavens horrible
I don't watch a lot in News

133
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:18,990
but I don't remember the time however
the leader the hackers said

134
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,530
you know today we're going after data

135
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,750
I don't remember that happening you know

136
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,710
the is Sunzu says the air was based on
the surgeon when you're far away pretend

137
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,740
like you're near

138
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,890
when you're near you know for tonight if
our way

139
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,990
okay if that's what you really think
people are dealing with that they want

140
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,530
PIII

141
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,719
you know I am I think this couple
actresses

142
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,800
last week that would disagree with us
now had to sum up this really mine

143
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,329
um not me not me I'm just saying some
people in here I'm looking at certain

144
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:54,319
people

145
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:58,400
you um

146
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,839
here's the thing I it to me I E

147
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,530
dole I data is important date is not
everything

148
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,970
so let's just let's just figured out
right now data is not secure

149
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,900
we all agree with their and I really
just he doing talks on data

150
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,030
but that's all people want to talk about
p I hi

151
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,120
pH I you know okay

152
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,709
so if that's the case I said okay a play
that game

153
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:29,600
let's see how we can I if

154
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,339
if everybody's concerned about data we
know it's not secure how

155
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,390
in secure is it how can we actually get
the information

156
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,130
and that was the genesis of the stock a
a good friend of mine

157
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,079
is talking tomorrow at one his aims I
love Paul Kagame

158
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,800
calls guy mister I P the dude when he
starts talking

159
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,400
it from Huntsville so he's got the yeah
talks like this is like they've

160
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,400
they were but he'll start talking about
routers and like in two seconds

161
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,689
i think is speaking another language but
the problem with him

162
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:04,439
is he submits everywhere and I get
jealous one night

163
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:08,089
I got drunk and I submitted this call
for papers

164
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,900
everywhere and I got accepted and I
hadn't done researcher

165
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,240
so I was like ok rap let's hope this
turns out good

166
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,520
so really quickly I turn to

167
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,030
where can I obtain sensitive data that
anybody's think it was dumpster diving

168
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,589
some was Gerber good friend of mine that
was dumpster diving today take that but

169
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:32,720
they take that but we're gonna okay like
Jackson my from

170
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,339
I had a credit card will put it on up

171
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:39,870
some said so can we actually

172
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,550
obtain sensitive data without actually
preaching access controls

173
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,750
are we so screwed up out there I

174
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,300
don't even need to hack any more so

175
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,980
what were the areas I came up with I'll
what are these

176
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,980
is one that we've heard about all the
time purchasing all hardware

177
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,829
hear about this all the time but I go I
don't know anybody that's actually

178
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,279
done in someone could do this a purchase

179
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,400
hardware in no you de have hardly

180
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,209
yeah um social media sites like to talk
about this I'm not talking about

181
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:14,069
Facebook

182
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:17,980
okay and then I'm at the bain

183
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,029
in dealing with a lot of companies are
like you know we have FTP server scum

184
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,110
like you know

185
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,000
these people are so they don't even know
FTP is

186
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,079
and there's no s in front are after I
wonder just how many people are actually

187
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,640
running FTP servers up there sup

188
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,670
script let's look at STP servers so
these are the three areas we're going to

189
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,520
look at

190
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,650
now first morning and I took a photo of
everyone

191
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,130
and I have enhanced the using my

192
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,260
you know jack power phone put it to my
socket

193
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,000
I know who you are this is a
demonstration

194
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,579
this is not a manual for criminal
behavior

195
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:00,689
okay the apps use a cation up all the
data

196
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:04,110
you actually see justice really
professional smudge

197
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,250
on the stuff that was done by me okay

198
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,240
when possible I contacted the data
owners

199
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,439
talk about awkward the first one was

200
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:18,650
a person on Facebook and I go high you
don't know me

201
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,439
but I'm I got all your data

202
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:26,770
and I try to make a bag o you know I'm
actually ethical hacker I've been on CNN

203
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,459
like

204
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:31,559
then I realized here people that are
usually on the news Nana mistrust anyway

205
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:36,370
so we're screwed self I actually quit
contacting

206
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,610
because I got too much information I
have a day job

207
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,709
and a business to run we're talking
thousands and thousands and thousands

208
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,750
tens of thousands of people

209
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,930
and there's a reason I put this up
because you guys will start doing this

210
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,760
before the talks over

211
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,579
on the identity and the owners have been
hidden to protect the security impair

212
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,769
okay sup what do we do with

213
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:06,190
hardware if I hear ever deal with FTK
imager

214
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,290
are creating a physical image okay this
is easy for you

215
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,040
I always liked it dumb this down because
I need stuff dumb down to me so

216
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,949
we're gonna get everybody on the same
level for salmon industry friends again

217
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:21,440
image what this means this isn't like a
ghost image

218
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,589
right give a terabyte drive and you have
500 gig data

219
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:29,190
ghost you have led by 500 gig drive at
image

220
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,829
a forensic image is a bit by bit you're
a terabyte drive

221
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:36,880
you have a terabyte image it's capturing
the slack space the

222
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,240
unused space all that remember I always
think of a hard drive

223
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,519
as a book and everything is at

224
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,750
indexed you know in the index when we
delete something we do not rip that page

225
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,800
up we remove the index

226
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,000
game so the date is not always got so
what I would do is i three friends again

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,820
image

228
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,990
i den with data car data carving is
nothing more than going in and

229
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,170
reassembling files

230
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,449
okay so that whole lawyer I deleted it

231
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:11,120
stated no you didn't beard is well you
deleted it but still there

232
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,509
I am and like the underwear gnomes can
profit from it

233
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:18,449
so the people I targeted

234
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:21,779
when on e-bay and I targeted I T E

235
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,910
II targeted individuals are selling hi

236
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,149
and and selling a lot love

237
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:31,430
equipment IT employees that are you know

238
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,949
overnight is the same or more solid on
e-bay these were the people

239
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:38,430
I was talking I was targeting I am

240
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,509
which first what do you do with your
end-of-life and

241
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:46,339
in the flight hardware if it magically
disappears you may go ask your IT person

242
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:50,850
where he bought a new car how he did we
did two rounds a purchase is now in the

243
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,790
second round

244
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,350
I did a included harder resellers a dean
at the beginning

245
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,630
cuz I made an assumption and and sailors
we've come a call he PC

246
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,139
I am good friends of ours and they have
the coolest thing

247
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:07,019
they have a hard drive shredder on a
truck okay

248
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:12,009
him its cool iPod hard drives this to
shred it via the powered up

249
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:16,279
you throw it in Sparks come out as
little pieces like the some like I do

250
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,320
too good a ganar

251
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,100
Dave get of the truck and leave our
property

252
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,019
um so I really I didn't look at them but
the second round I did

253
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:31,029
okay also by a so I ended up buying two
iPhones

254
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,940
in nine hard drives now but here's the
thing: phones do not decrease in value

255
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,990
very much I was getting all hard drives

256
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,029
I bottom idee harder spin could

257
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,759
I had to go find an I D E cable from
like you know

258
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,850
back in the closet toll cost fifty
dollars for the

259
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,220
iPhones 120 for the hard drive again me

260
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,240
my boss is my wife she has the money

261
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
has so I didn't get to do much urs now

262
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,470
what were the results I am I wasn't
saying this account I hate Apple

263
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,339
okay I'm just not a big fan I literally
had one day in the nineties

264
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,310
Steve Jobs what has work a marketing
company Steve Jobs called my boss

265
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,959
and get pissed at us cuz we're running
his server

266
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,199
on I S server wasn't my fault justice
system admins

267
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,500
I don't like him for that I don't like
proprietary I don't like a company and

268
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,050
lies about security

269
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,600
K I don't like 'em love me or hate me

270
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,720
that's how Apple people or I am
unfortunately

271
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,899
the iPhones the one good thing they do
from a security standpoint

272
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:42,420
is the day 0 out when a factory reset

273
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,199
the the on memory

274
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,709
this is a pain in the ass for us friends
like investigators but it's kinda good

275
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,069
for you

276
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:54,850
okay so I really just bought two phones
arm

277
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,910
when I'm mad at home I just yell at him

278
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,149
just from a burden you know I am I gonna
hate you age you iPhone in

279
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:07,169
the my wife comes and goes my meds now
as far as hard drive zeroed out really

280
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:08,040
what we do

281
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,470
when we win we principally cleaning
drive we put zeros

282
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,770
and every spot if you wanna get really
crazy then you put random data and

283
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,060
then you 0 the new programme de in use
your the thing about

284
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,399
we can go eight levels deep to get it if
you have an electron microscope

285
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:27,810
okay and I don't by chance have one of
those

286
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,880
place is good enough once really good
but the into the day just destroy the

287
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,710
damn thing

288
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,899
okay there's no way people carry a
somewhat now how many in my nine drives

289
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:38,159
were zeroed out

290
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:43,129
1 and it was a high school student in
Texas

291
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:46,129
go Texas school before going

292
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:50,169
depressors talk about Satanism so um

293
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:54,590
now how many of these worry partitioned
with artifacts mean

294
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,240
they just went in and they cover the
partitions realize that doesn't do much

295
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,570
right the data still there and in fact

296
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,909
packages recreate the partition there
are seven of those

297
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:10,889
K I am five or more a week off floor
model or worsens

298
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,510
and what I'm so what I mean here is a
look like they were the stock drives

299
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,669
that came in

300
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:20,220
and maybe they upgraded the drive slot
those out maybe for the existing drives

301
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,800
it was just a clean image from like Dell
or IBM

302
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,860
something like that we had one from the
University of

303

um when any employee leaves

322
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,169
create a forensic image love their drive
and keep it for two years

323
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:47,830
every incident I deal with

324
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,200
the person has usually left on good
terms I did deal for the Chinese

325
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,929
national left in the middle of the night

326
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:58,500
and they didn't expect think that was
really weird until your leader but

327
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,560
always friends again Mitch K this is
what

328
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,980
FTK imager looks like K you go n

329
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,300
poppin n you write blocker bring it up

330
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,040
now shows the physical drive

331
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,850
and then what I would do real quick to
tell the zeroed out you can literally

332
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,679
just scroll

333
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:22,580
breakthrough and if you see anything but
dots

334
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,940
there's data on their okay just real
quick easy thing to do

335
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,330
then what I would do is I would start
today to cover

336
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,889
K however this one's case strange
because

337
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:37,159
I head a plus sign which meant

338
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:40,679
I had partitions

339
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,760
cool are you have partitions let's look
in these well we have

340
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,340

343
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,080
now I bought this one from a reseller K
just so you know

344
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,760

345
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,099
purchase from resided a dick armey by
one to see what kinda data was on there

346
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:12,580
before hand side through the FTK

347
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,849

okay and so did her certificate a berth
in her social security number

349
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,879
her dad saw social security numbers to
give birth

350
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:30,349
I'm like under 18 closures

351
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:35,500
what hassles you know these people are
reselling the information

352
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,409
I start looking a little bit more start
realizing

353
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:42,409
with someone like that matters
stereotype

354
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:45,740
why would a person like this have these

355
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:50,159
PID oh my god it hit me she's the
reseller

356
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,369
okay login info in he's

357
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:59,460

greatest lesbian movies

358
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,960
I kept that one if anybody wants to
watch

359
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,720
1 overall repairs I look this

360
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,849
lady up think about this

361
00:22:09,849 --> 00:22:12,950
she is the hardware reseller

362
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,970
she is in a state known for

363
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:22,090
crawfish her company is a government
contractor to re

364
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,169
cell government equipment

365
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:28,409
and she sold me her only damn hard drive

366
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:34,669
with outdoing anything on it

367
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:41,669
let that sink in this is the least
craziest thing on my show you today

368
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,060
ahead I'm telling you this stuff

369
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:51,040
is addicting up

370
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,470
refurbisher I really haven't but I'll be
quite us like they said

371
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,270
I don't really ever do these proactive
talks

372
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,619
on but you know somehow someone and

373
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:06,270
Iran ends up with Apache you know
blueprints on

374
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,760
iPod arm I know the e the stars out
there

375
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,629
and lots of a set at some point all of
us were ignorant of this

376
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:18,750
at some point in our career we all did
this at some point puts 2014 for crying

377
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,649
out loud

378
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:25,570
right purchase from the resell it wasn't
format it was it even on partitioned

379
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,919
it was her home

380
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,119
system her own system

381
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:35,450
right now my conclusion was

382
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,750
this is promising but it's like going to
a casino

383
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,050
I really think phones would be more
fruitful

384
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:47,450
but again they are expensive because
your special in the third world

385
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,980
countries they will buy

386
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,639
these older phones Cape the question i
hand have for you is

387
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:57,070
how do you handle into life media

388
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,179
you know yeah get a hard drive shredder

389
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:03,639
it's awesome the other thing you need is
a sledgehammer

390
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:06,669
office space it we used to do that the
bank

391
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:10,050
it really doesn't destroy data but very
very

392
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:15,560
good for the soul K specially when you
do it in a client parking lot

393
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,659
um cell again

394
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:24,210
date is cheap I mean he may have been
here since the 90's in ninety

395
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,490
us K do you remember

396
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,119
the day that you go oh my god I have

397
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,419
well I remember the day I go oh my god I
have a hard drive

398
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:38,339
but the day is where you're like all my
god I have a gig

399
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:41,450
I only paid seven hundred dollars for
this

400
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,560
Bradley Cooper all the company date on
there now and I'm like dude that's not

401
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,419
even gonna hold my last Archer episode
you know

402
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:52,820
it's cheap destroy it

403
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,849
there is nothing anybody can do to
reassemble it's not like you know the

404
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:00,970
shredded papers and Iran in the
seventies

405
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,830
you take apart a hard drive you're gonna
have a really hard time even getting it

406
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,409
back synchronize right you sure that
mother into little pieces

407
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:13,859
did if someone gets the data they
deserve it okay

408
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:17,109
we all agree on that alright

409
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:22,609
now the other one the next part is the
social media site

410
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:27,490
and I decided I want to start looking at
social sharing sites Facebook

411
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,710
you know I'm my teacher a Ohio

412
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:36,010
a footprinting I am everybody always go
straight to Facebook and LinkedIn

413
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:40,379
right and you just don't you guys get a
little lazy and what i do. a kiss for 24

414
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:41,159
put

415
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,230
Facebook and then if it gets harder I
told my hackers I could do this

416
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:49,460
I got boss things to do you know up but
there's other things out there

417
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,530
so the love I look there was Photobucket

418
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,629
you may hear use photobucket dollar gyd
think

419
00:25:55,629 --> 00:26:00,530
have your phone handy I now why I chose
Photobucket

420
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,440
Photobucket has a feature call recent
uploads

421
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,339
and what it will actually do is it will
actually show you

422
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:11,450
photos people have recently uploaded

423
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,659
no why is this important

424
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:18,119
the recent uploads are open

425
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:23,280
photos K open buckets as they call it

426
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,669
they have an app I use Dropbox

427
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:30,220
rate and goes to Dropbox unlike Dropbox

428
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,750
the fault photos get updated uploaded

429
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,349
automatically by default those buckets

430
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:41,379
are open yeah

431
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:44,760
now and this is what we look like now

432
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,570
basically all you're gonna look for and
there's 18 pages of photos

433
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,879
18 pages videos I'm gonna tell you I
spent I think like eight hours

434
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:56,000
in reality prolly three months of my
life this year

435
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,040
has gone away because you just good 5 at
five

436
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,950
5 reproach what can we find today RB
gets addicting now before you pull out

437
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,800
your computer

438
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,020
start doing us I am I'm gonna tell you

439
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,669
and and under 18 this is where the heck
owes I'll

440
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:16,210
yes I found stuff like this

441
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,599
could be very X-rated okay apparently

442
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,639
every female in the world

443
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:26,649
twerps I found that out we were on to
you ladies

444
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:30,300
also if you're pregnant apparently

445
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,669
it's mandatory that you take at least
seven hundred photos

446
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:37,470
up the pregnancy test stick I guess
because the

447
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,669
you need it did you did that didn't she
good okay

448
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:46,369

I a also found this guy okay

450
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:55,800

467
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,349
I hate you start to learn a lot about
the human psyche

468
00:28:55,349 --> 00:28:58,629
when you see this stuff that they're
uploading

469
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:02,440
that they don't think they the tripling

pisses me off more than anything

481
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,339
are there any federal cops in K

482
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:49,580

the Mafia maybe they're dealing with

485
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,800
tens of thousands a cards

486
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,440
I can poem this guy and good luck trying
to trace it back to me

487
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,859

CSI would be able to figure that out and

488
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,520
they figure lost about 23 minutes

489
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,750
I'm not to pick on I'm not to pick on
just the americans because I do this

490
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,510

in um the UK he also gave me the back of
his car

493
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:31,369

actually deciding

494
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:34,510
which what to show

495
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,760

way to automate really

578
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,790
now I said this and I'm a

me and backing goes

583
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,030

some other tools out there that the tech

587
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,640

6-foot-5 300-pound white guy from

592
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,570
Oklahoma

593
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,540
big do week on corn fed right

594
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,440

figured out how I can kill someone

595
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,470
I can hunt them down and kill non-white

you control pic leakage

598
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,680

599
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,490
is great the BYOD with DLP

600
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,650

601
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:22,960
so that fed the the company I talked
about the Chinese national they

602
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,079
literally called us up into FBI told us
that the Chinese the lower information

603
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,119
like phone

604
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,420
problem number was the FBI let it happen
but we won't go there

605
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,530
I called them up and they got we go
there and they go

606
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,320

lost in the mail the night last year

608
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:45,710
that may have been a warning you think
and I could you guys let phones Ilya

609
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,060
these their phones click click click
click

610
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,540
how do you control all that I love my
phone

611
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,599
were hacking firm we deal with BYOD
problems a hug

612
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:01,650
chairing 56 phones but what do you do to
keep people

613
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,640
from doing stuff no sensitive data goes
on our farms

614
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,820
it's a great idea very certain parts

615
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,759
overbuilding phones are not allowed

616
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:16,789
after parties happy hours phones are not
allowed to keep

617
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:20,009
that helps so be very careful with that

618
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:24,480
this is one area people don't even think
about and if you're using Photobucket or

619
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,740
someone you know is using Photobucket

620
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,700
talent to close it and yet it may be
that girl you liked in high school

621
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,809
you can search putting clothes okay
creepy story when I first started

622
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:37,019
looking for this

623
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:40,119
I found one of my X the 1 I'm people
like

624
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:44,079
graduate with was a prostitute through
college

625
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,359
that was the most awkward conversation I
had because I had to say

626
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,980
I don't think it's you though you know
there's not too many people that look

627
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,920
like you but

628
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,559
and have the exact same strange handle
for the hooker in a min for your

629
00:38:56,559 --> 00:38:58,380
photobucket name but

630
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,819
you much closer

631
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:06,680
and that's good question haley paige is
a GPS information all the access data

632
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,930
stripped out at Photobucket

633
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,250
okay but a let's talk

634
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,549
at the last one I got to this point ago
good

635
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:19,990
I got a good talk I'm fine it everything
else goes to crap

636
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,359
I can at least going to talk at least
someone will go

637
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,210
cool of his/her but a so the rest are
looking on FTP sites now

638
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,349
what I used well was met up Metasploit

639
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:35,900
a FTP anonymous scanner arm

640
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,210
a good friend of mine kept going dude
you use in men

641
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,140
problem I the reason I don't like to use
a map I'm is because in my apt if you'd

642
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,210
if the site does not have an FTP site

643
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,240
it's going to login those logs very
quickly become very very very large

644
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,779
a FTP anonymous scanner which is built
in

645
00:39:54,779 --> 00:39:58,250
I'll will actually go and only show

646
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,589
the ones that are open K

647
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:04,799
I love not typical finding I started
going through

648
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:08,029
I am and

649
00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:12,630
src stuff like this alright music

650
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,940
movies right in stood head airline
captain Ron

651
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,170
I just wondered if power to leave a note
be like the

652
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,839
your stuffs out there but good choice
and me a good choice

653
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,569
which was for me it's good but then I
searching weird stuff like this

654
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:32,720
QuickBooks flight the

655
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,730
right um recycle bin

656
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:42,299
that's not right but OK and

657
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:48,240
in let's face it there's a lot of people
and I T the don't even know what FTPS

658
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,400
let alone some of these people that
don't even know what a folder is

659
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,920
they're sharing stuff and I start to see
transforming know this is January of

660
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,109
this year

661
00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:02,990
one other ones I have seen was this
welcomed a sus

662
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:07,769
RT bottle bomb it was this

663
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:10,940
alright and a a other what

664
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,259
you can do is it has built an cloud

665
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:17,359
you plug a drive-in

666
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,369
it creates announce

667
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:25,549
and by default if you have UPnP creates
an anonymous FTP site

668
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:28,789
up to the internet this was awesome

669
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:31,980
we found I found this five days

670
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,750
before b-side San Francisco I'm on the
fault my PR calmly

671
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,960
in with 0 day this is great I'm the dude

672
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,250
in the Green Lantern shirt you'll see
him because he's the only one that will

673
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,630
where Green Lantern shirt in the entire
con I calmed down or Ben

674
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:53,279
because I'm getting all excited I'm
doing backflips and he sends me this

675
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:56,980
are you kidding me someone just released
this okay

676
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,430
now to those guys credit I am he'd have
held onto it for

677
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,059
eight months and Acer said no

678
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:09,559
that's not a bug to configuration

679
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:13,089
okay I am but

680
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:17,440
that wasn't all now would be fine this
is the %uh this is the point where I

681
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,220
would love to be able to show you all
the stuff we found bud

682
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,410
the problem with the way the laws are
built right now

683
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,460
if I show you in FTP

684
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,470
in detail I'm breaking the law

685
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,599
in the united states only it everywhere
else I'm fine

686
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:40,890
so my lawyer said I cannot show you the
stuff he actually does do don't be an

687
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,329
idiot

688
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:45,049
so I'll tell you what I found um

689

financial information call or okay com

690
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,410
on encrypted backups everywhere as Moses
have backup software

691
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:57,720
built-in medical records pH II

692
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,960
there was a psychiatrist in Boston every
one of his

693
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,359
arm site as psychological profiles of
his patients were

694
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:10,970
on the Internet arm intellectual
property

695
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,049
at so I have to tell you I'm only
telling this

696
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:18,680
having to leave our sister decides this
group and you know YouTube now

697
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,829

I did find a sex tape love a major
executive in a car company

offer conversations

700
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,680
I umbilical property

701
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,119
your I am from was is one

702
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:41,470
you know other things I found employees
take

703
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,200
data home because they want to keep it
for resume stuff

704
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,119
passwords galore I use passwords the
need to the name passwords Lorca someone

705
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,640
named his things pass from school or an
idea that just

706
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,410
that bad is it there's a large being

707
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,910
in america that's a wrap around
everywhere

708
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,500
um that their main architect's

709
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,990
head a spreadsheet I'll look there's all
their router passwords

710
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,549
and their entire Vizio document

711
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:15,660
and forceful as able to find them
because as grain Cardinals information

712
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,289
was on there and I called the guy up and
I'm like a

713
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:22,990
my hat hacker I found a star and he was
silent

714
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,009
can use both thanks so I am

715
00:44:26,009 --> 00:44:30,079
it has a lot of it out there a political
information

716
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,180
found one that was for major mayor in
the United States

717
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,799
also interestingly enough a made some
major I

718
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:40,999
mom see packs I'm interestingly enough

719
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:44,029
in the state in New Jersey they have

720
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:49,170
on the voter rolls arm active voters
that were born in 1870

721
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:54,980
so if you're in New Jersey you have a
very clean political system

722
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,670
in a nutshell I found everything

723
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:04,650
everything let's face it these people
don't even know what ft Pierce

724
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,430
as a a b-side coupley see I did this and
they said a

725
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,779
this kid goes here but we're we wanna
talk about companies

726
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:16,799
this is personal stuff ago you have to
realize

727
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:21,400
ninety-nine percent of all companies are
not big corporations

728
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,180
their I T is Walmart and Best Buy

729
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,140
and Amazon they don't even know what
this stuff does

730
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,529
but they have the exact same information

731
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:36,480
50 these will give me the information as
a single hacker

732
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,940
I need and it's a lot less dangerous
than hacking in

733
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,589
came now aces is not alone

734
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:47,829
and 222 I

735
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:52,029
last week just finally we notified all
these people

736
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:55,230
we gave him eight months like the
southern German did

737
00:45:55,230 --> 00:46:00,140
and they never responded so the other
companies that have this issue

738
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,619
next year cloud box

739
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:06,890
links us Cisco

740
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:10,549
K now to their credit

741
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:14,200
for example in cloud box it doesn't I'm
actually created

742
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,789
you have to click a button and search
share with others

743
00:46:17,789 --> 00:46:21,569
and then it automatically create an FTP
site UPnP you

744
00:46:21,569 --> 00:46:24,589
no one mentions FTB people that Sage
your

745
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:27,809
did think about the people that we're
dealing with here you say

746
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:31,170
your FTP sites open their their prime
looking at there's a bird they're like

747
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:33,490
you we don't know what you're talking
about

748
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:37,150
its all out there 'em

749
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:41,690
now I'm not the only one that knows this
there was people that were

750
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,200
doing a show of folders have like AB AB
AB AB AB

751
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,220
and what they're doing is our own
scripts to see what was right along

752
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,730
okay the other thing too is a lot of
these I saw read-only but had stuff

753
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:56,640
I'm actually doing a search right now
IOM

754
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,119
looking for review password admin

755
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:04,079
admin rude our admin password

756
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,450
and I'm hitting Canada right now

757
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:11,160
and I'm I've probably got about down a
reason

758
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,160
$8,900 hits I'll in ashes in the past
week

759
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,220

00:48:56,259 --> 00:48:59,329
okay and now it was in French um

788
00:48:59,329 --> 00:49:05,430
my wife is the red-headed irish-catholic
french-canadian descent

she's trying to kill me okay if I wind
up dead she killed me

790
00:49:08,749 --> 00:49:11,789
it's on national news now so where

just translate it for me

796
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:33,369
what really got me was agents
surveillance logs

797
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:37,660
discount weird right um they have
read/write access

798
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,880
now long story short when we go to the

799
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,900
hospital these days you know we may pay
for insurance but we don't pay for stuff

800
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,539
like TV

801
00:49:47,539 --> 00:49:51,359
and phone in France you needed

802
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,509
free health care but you don't get free

803
00:49:54,509 --> 00:49:58,049
phone and movies

804
00:49:58,049 --> 00:50:01,329
so you have kiosk

805
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:04,349
and this is the server for the kiosk

806
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:07,349
on the internal network with

807
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:10,759
reading right access with

808
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:16,210
credit card numbers patient health axe
information and a place for me to put be

809
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:20,069

811
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:26,599
certain type of device no one looks at

812
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:30,990

just hit

818
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:55,539
