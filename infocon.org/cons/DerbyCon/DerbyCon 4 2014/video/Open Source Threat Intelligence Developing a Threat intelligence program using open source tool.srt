1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:04,910
I'm

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:10,219
alright

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:14,490
Derby Conn 40 after party and you guys
are all here

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,980
I am impressed everybody enjoying Derby
Conn 40

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,380
sweet is this not been awesome

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,660
I'm their usual recovering lights been
turned down the

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,800
prevent the head the up affects a
hangover

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,030
so this morning we're going talk about
open source intelligence

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,800
and one other things that that I love
about her back on this year was a backed

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,989
it was family-centered

11
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,100
in originally my family was supposed to
be coming down the Derby Conn

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,329
year so we had this discussion with

13
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:50,000
up my wife and I'm where she start
looking at some the information

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,980
and of course the thing I key in on is
that my talk is bland

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,170
that's what I heard now if you read the
whole thing she she actually did say

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,559
that

17
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,809
Lessard I ran into Larry about the fact

18
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,360
that was planted he suggested we go with
another topic

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,990
sold where we're dropping the the
open-source

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,470
are the bland topic along with sexy
explosions

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,740
morning cock

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,770
so I like to tell people that I'm jaded
impose sec person

23
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,009
what that translates to is a quarter of
a century appearing people tell me

24
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,189
well that's not fair that's not how it
Taxco blah blah blah

25
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:37,530
I am not a doctor I just tend to be more
comfortable wearing a suit then

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,790
anything else that comes from a lotta
years working where I'd wear uniform

27
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,409
on today's topic is going to be focused
more on

28
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,860
threat intelligence among them what we
can do for organizations

29
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,490
so it's gonna be a little bit a
technology-based with a little bit

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,880
love programs I the house up business
management

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,380
I'll a productions programs

32
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,450
so little bit about me I mean I'll a
farm boy

33
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,600
this was before I was jaded by the way

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,420
I am a geek this is sitting actually in
my home office

35
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,360
um much to the chagrin of my life

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,460
who says I spend more time with this
then I do with her

37
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,920
and I can say that that is not the case
because I have four children

38
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,000
did I'm a veteran of the United States
Navy are there any other veterans in air

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,670
in ladies and gentlemen thank you very
much for your service

40
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,850
greatly appreciated I'm a
science-fiction fan

41
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,430
I am a geek sort of hand in hand if
anybody can find me on the one in white

42
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,360
I am certified in different things but
one thing I had going to conferences in

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,170
hearing is that I'm certified in this
that and the other

44
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,930
so I am certifiable and of course I
can't make mention of the newborn

45
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,690
without that

46
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:06,690
so while I don't have all the answers

47
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,120
are II will take time to to respond to
requests emails to chads

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,120
stocks on Twitter text messages um

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,010
also it may not be a good idea to let
your seven-year-old follow me on twitter

50
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,250
because I am jaded and I will post
things up like this

51
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,810
that will get you do this

52
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,370
in so now we're talking about sexy
explosions

53
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,300
so when we're talking about threat
intelligence were talking about

54
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,480
aggregating lots of information cross
the Internet

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,390
I'm sure a lot of us have seen the sexy
explosion Jess

56
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:49,390
ok great if I'm having technical
difficulties now

57
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,610
who %ah amazing

58
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,750
what does that tell us looks pretty
right

59
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,299
it's great put up on the sock on the
executive's come in the room because now

60
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:07,330
we can say you know we're watching the
Internet

61
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,740
so what if we have the ability to
prevent incidents and get out in front

62
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,810
of some these things that that actually

63
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,920
are targeting organizations parking lot
for my glasses on so I can read

64
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,340
so things like sites for distributing
malware

65
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,440
sy syms are launching spam campaigns

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,440
folks are scanning networks knowing
where

67
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,670
phishing attacks are coming from as well
as were those attacks originating at

68
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,720
working proactively defend our business

69
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,810
and and see what's actually going on out
there on the Internet

70
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,500
up things so give you a brief overview

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,110
up today's topic and what we're going to
do in this is gonna be available online

72
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,240
thanks to Andy who is an absolute
machine

73
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,290
getting these things cranked out if you
haven't had the opportunity to go thank

74
00:04:59,290 --> 00:04:59,920
him for

75
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,310
for giving back to the community make
sure you do him and his team

76
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,450
are outstanding so in the beginning

77
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,450
hip

78
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,810
so this actually started several years
ago the concepts are the several years

79
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,610
ago when I saw the

80
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,120
transition in the industry on that
information security

81
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,310
but the different verticals that are out
there across-the-board

82
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,070
hmm where actually heard as security
conference

83
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,390
would attack us we're in Ohio that's
great defense right

84
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,070
your now on deck is because we may close

85
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,820
one that got me was too small to be on
anybody's radar

86
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,540
that's rather interesting concept
thinking on the global connectivity that

87
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,120
we have

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,740
we don't have anything that we anybody
would want

89
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,970
which if you have a business tell you
this

90
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,430
begs the question and I i've been told
that I need to attend more Dale Carnegie

91
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,160
courses

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,139
of because my first response was so why
are you in business

93
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,879
this is like a tax shelter Ponzi scheme
something going on that I should be

94
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,560
aware of

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,840
we don't have a large footprint

96
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,240
now these are some really interesting
concepts which may be

97
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,199
asked the following question: a ski
tango

98
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:31,199
will stop right there on the right back
to the whiskey and then I got accused

99
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,490
them

100
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,639
being a butler now we all know what up a
peddler's right

101
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,659
sales guys I am NOT a sales guy

102
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm the last person you want to try to
close a sale for you

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,240
I was not happy

104
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,630
good but it got me to thinking

105
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,900
about the fact that well

106
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,969
if these are the common cancer

107
00:06:55,969 --> 00:07:00,099
misconceptions going on the questions
that are brought up in my mind

108
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:05,130
is that were real people and executives
management really thinking that this was

109
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,860
not a threat

110
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,930
where they not concerned about it who
would attack us

111
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:15,319
were too small anybody in here believe
for a moment that if you're on the inner

112
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:15,779
tent

113
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,909
internet you are too small course not
and security professionals

114
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:24,409
I'm in the presence of greatness right
now thank you

115
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:30,759
so

116
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,130
what i'm saying is everybody's wearing
rose-colored glasses

117
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,539
sold being that

118
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,690
that I'm why those individuals and I
think does want people in here and in

119
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,150
the in the room this morning that

120
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,770
have to know the why how something works

121
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,210
so what I ended up doing was going at it
in approaching it from the aspect the

122
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,450
collecting that data so I had to figure
out somebody that I could sacrifice

123
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,390
now either i'm too old are you don't
know who we Harvey Oswald is

124
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:04,990
let's just say that Kennedy really
shoulda had a closed

125
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:11,460
top the nevermind so this all started
out using residential IP address space

126
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,000
very small footprint very small system

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,680
I was users using an to collect data you

128
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,960
so the system came up online I was
monitoring it now I was doing that

129
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,390
that lovely thing I've a log monitoring

130
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,810
anybody in your deal a PC I'm yeah we
all monitor our logs right

131
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,770
yes so I put the system online

132
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,060
but that brought up the question whether
or not you is gonna Tackett

133
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,650
so 34 minutes after the system came up
online

134
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,760
got it first it's got its first attack
which you know rock on his career

135
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,890
there are allies right so it's not that
bad

136
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,200
in her web attack came in

137
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,800
little over a day later but that's okay
because they're from Texas year

138
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:10,800
god bless Texas so I had somebody who
actually asked me why do I think I was

139
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,600
being attacked

140
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,640
well number one idea promoted to Google
being

141
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,260
Yahoo for those are you are old enough
Alta Vista

142
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,620
um Ask Jeeves

143
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,210
yeah letting go out there was not part
of the register domain this is a street

144
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,670
IP address so there's no domain
Association this is not a news

145
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,780
system on the on the internet it's just
out there

146
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,010
and again I just threw it online plus
because I was doing little bit log

147
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,740
analysis

148
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,150
I'm pretty sure that's not

149
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,690
normal web traffic

150
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,590
um so I start collecting some others
data

151
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,100
and as I start going through I was like
answer my own question okay so who's

152
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,050
interested in me

153
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,890
so I started doing a little bit a
visualization around

154
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,760
you know where at and you know this
again these are all open source tools

155
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,180
on there will be less than later on the
slides job so you guys can go out and do

156
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,860
this yourself

157
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,310
because we have enough time to do that
right

158
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,380
because we go to work and we don't
really have a job

159
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,210
we just yeah so but this could be
coincidence cuz I'm sorry I'm

160
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,110
I'm from columbus ohio for those are you
don't you don't know no Columbus has

161
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,060
some very large organizations

162
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,740
so I might not have been the actual
target right

163
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,950
yeah and I'm

164
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,400
however now because of the fact that I
do have that

165
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,030
that bulldog mentality that hacker ish
hacker ask

166
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,270
view on things I I needed to get more
information

167
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,780
size are looking at ways im calling in
favors and and

168
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,600
going the the router a honeypot
deployments now anybody ever in her work

169
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,460
with honey pots

170
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,000
rent put your hand down um

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,690
so I start looking and affirm honey pots
and when I ended up coming across was

172
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,960
the Slovak call by nm which is great
because it captures all the information

173
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,650
and you know

174
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,280
the these attackers are very willing to
give you all this information

175
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,260
but great so what can I do with it well
I am a capitalist

176
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,210
so I keep wanna kill or in this case
what they were able to get being

177
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,130
but what it also gave me is from an
intelligent aspect

178
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,000
where the source was originating now I'm
not so much

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,750
what country was the actor Ranbir where
the IP was coming from

180
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,920
which if that doesn't compromise bad no
good

181
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,900
was an automated or was it 18

182
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,270
person behind the keyboard now after a
couple months a monitoring this it was

183
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,190
really easy to a start identifying

184
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:49,770
the automated attacks but I and a lot
you to replace some other secure shell

185
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,690
sessions

186
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,100
com so I was able actually watch
somebody like backspace

187
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,490
and I was like

188
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,860
colder that's natural for some party
want to break in answer to talk session

189
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,910
with them and say you know

190
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:08,910
hey welcome thank you you make a
conference it also lobbied to monitor

191
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,519
the historical progression a bad

192
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,759
so as I started seeing the system come
online in the longer it stayed on line

193
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:20,850
I was able to see more more tax now I am
a capitalist

194
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,769
so I was taken their tools and I'm my
partner who's

195
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:28,139
a.m. a reverse engineer so we can
actually carry the stuff apart

196
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,019
take a look at it and we just ordered an
arsenal because it can pass AB

197
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,779
because ABC's your I'll why not use it
right

198
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:41,290
so made my job a little bit easier but
we also use a two-star cataloging

199
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,889
malicious software as well so you sat in
the incident response

200
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:51,740
practice area so this comment is what
actually start this off the internet a

201
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,860
bad things

202
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,250
up that was where the the claim that
blood came from

203
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:02,889
and for those of you are unaware bad
things to happen on the Internet in

204
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,399
so prior to commercialization the
Internet

205
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,319
I'll very small very controlled
environment

206
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:16,019
which by the way October 29 1969 was not
a Friday so the gates were not

207
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,449
actually you know working on a Friday
night sadly this was hump day

208
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:26,180
so even worse so here we come

209
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,209
today commercialization on the Internet
work everywhere

210
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,180
were connected be our phones at work
tablets you name it

211
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,809
so as the commercialization occurred we
start seeing more and more fraud

212
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:40,689
activity

213
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,839
criminal activity targeting consumers

214
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,160
an organization's know we had the game
changer

215
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,730
so for those who you are out there who
are unaware

216
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:57,770
just let you know

217
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,550
in

218
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,170
for he seems like a such a nice man

219
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,730
he doesn't speak English well so I'll

220
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,890
what is a threat intelligence program is
it a buncha love

221
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,250
IP packets represented bouncing back and
forth

222
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,550
across the internet well yes and no

223
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:25,530
so threat intelligence

224
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,300
is not doable its part of the tool that
can be used

225
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,740
but we talk about threat intelligence
it's being able to ultimately make those

226
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,630
decisions

227
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,700
so it's not the Internet

228
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,360
yeah I went wrong on that one

229
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,600
collecting things and doing nothing with
it

230
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,770
how many of us working organizations are
data

231
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,910
orders we're gonna keep the data forever

232
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,630
why I'm so we have to actually do
something with that the information we

233
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,540
collect right

234
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,400
that something to keep in mind I'm great

235
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,330
once we get what we do with it I could
turn into a brooch I can turn into a

236
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:09,920
dragon

237
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,120
i cant but can I turn it into something
a value

238
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,920
threatened diligence is not meant to
replace the boots on the ground this is

239
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,380
an augmentation tool

240
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,510
you need those analyst you need those
folks on the ground actually star

241
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,050
taking action on it nor is it really a
substitute for

242
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,560
hers the stopping up monitoring your
networks you have to keep

243
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,030
eyes on them you guys should have a
little company out of Minnesota Cup

244
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,050
target RJ

245
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,040
good

246
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,700
there's really cool things like fire eye
twitch there were like

247
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,420
really good at identifying the stop in
alerting on it in fact there there's

248
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,660
reports that i've seen that said that
they were

249
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,730
had receive like sixty thousand reports
in two weeks that they never acted on

250
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,810
so we have a failure within

251
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:01,320
acting on information that was provided
now

252
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,230
for intelligence from a management
perspective and that this is one of the

253
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,570
key here is that we struggle with as an
industry is we've got some really great

254
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,560
technology

255
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,010
we get really great people we're not
managing it

256
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:20,010
ultimately the purpose of threat
intelligence is to be able to advise or

257
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,330
executive leaders in our management
staff so they can make decisions

258
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,840
so they can address the potential
risking or to the organization

259
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:37,240
we're going to work our get this done so
when we talk about threat intelligence

260
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,350
sources

261
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,500
where these kids come from they come
from

262
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,240
a lot of different organizations lot
different areas

263
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,830
we're going to talk about today are the
three aspects

264
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,960
up internet-based human based you know
conferences like this

265
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,050
or changing information as well as
automated

266
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,100
things that are within our organization
that we can pull from

267
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:06,360
during the planning aspect

268
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,860
we actually need to come up with a plan
I'll

269
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,080
I deal with a I'll spouses

270
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,209
has OCD so she like plans everything out
for me

271
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,940
by the way she was planning to come the
Derby Conn up until that comment so I

272
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,520
threw a wrench into that one

273
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,810
on I was told that I was point but we
have to be able to

274
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,630
address what it is that we want to
accomplish with the results what do we

275
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,610
want to be able to do

276
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,760
working to get a problem

277
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,740
while the key aspects also is what's the
confidence

278
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,570
in the the information that you're
getting because the internet is

279
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,900
comprised the being able to get data
from a lot of different places

280
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,520
we have all these little dade islands
out there and we've got to be able to

281
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,940
get it to

282
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,590
a point where we can actually leverage
in use at however

283
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,630
one other things that I discovered when
I start pulling us down I was like great

284
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,760
I find all the sources so I start know
putting all these things together

285
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,390
start downloading all this information
it fell like this in

286
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,510
didn't go over well as the Internet has
like

287
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,049
a lot more information than I i could
possibly imagine

288
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:23,370
but we get into the next stage a bit and
that's the collection

289
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,669
he'll we gotta have it accessible
available to us

290
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:31,030
so in my case because this was a pet
project

291
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,820
I went like with no commercial feeds it
was whatever I could scavenge of the

292
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,320
Internet

293
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,440
had to be timely and current why

294
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,010
because it does me no good the finalists
for SSH scanners from the Aetna

295
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,100
2002 right as up by Mimi does that
provide me any value

296
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,220
source confidence

297
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,360
is this somebody that's just generating
a tool based on

298
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,679
alerts are receiving or is there
somebody behind it that's actually doing

299
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,030
some analysis behind it

300
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,250
and all rank that based upon

301
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,950
that information is provided doesn't
give me what the information

302
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:10,270
that I P and the detail so again

303
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,150
different types and sources in my slides
apparently have decided to take their

304
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,590
own

305
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:20,160
correction because that's all messed up

306
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,049
%uh that's really bad

307
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:29,490
I do apologize

308
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,840
so different types a format so they can
come in

309
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,450
and I do not know why it's doing this
Mets line

310
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,990
of a

311
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,780
ok so the

312
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,580
demonstration got to ha eyes

313
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:55,280
and for those who've you are not aware I
am typically a teetotaler

314
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,400
so I do not drink all that much your

315
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,030
those going yeah you guys at your party
last night so what's a role at the chart

316
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,210
this all at once

317
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,280
here can I A tonight's service over the

318
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,850
the course that the the presentation in

319
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:21,130
what's that hope this is going to bed

320
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:28,130
yeah

321
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:39,190
the

322
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:44,840
her go

323
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,299
now my slides look a little

324
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:52,340
a lot better now he napped find out what
happened with those

325
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,530
alright

326
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,360
so getting back we have multiple sources
that we get areas from

327
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,600
see get information that comes in from
groups like that

328
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,260
different formats the cumin I can be a
text file

329
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:13,260
what so the presentations going to get
really interesting right about now

330
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,380
your that was rather yummy actually but

331
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:24,060
here

332
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,690
call

333
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:32,690
now now now the

334
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,090
I'm saving this one for later

335
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,820
he because otherwise

336
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,450
I won't be giving the presentation I
will be laying on the floor

337
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:55,480
giggling so we pull this this
information out

338
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,890
and we get it out across from from
multiple sources

339
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,720
it comes in different formats the one to
keep things as

340
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,060
we want to make sure the we put into a
position

341
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,440
worry normalizing actually can use the
information

342
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,780
they'll give you smirnoff ice as well

343
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,360
so we start talking about

344
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,760
analysis your

345
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,910
mmm allow

346
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:30,340
in their normalization validation

347
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,260
assessing in getting a categorized why
is that important

348
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,150
well things like I P biking or or

349
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,750
up by rise threat map are great for
getting the

350
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:49,300
the view of the Internet but is it
relevant to Joe are organizations

351
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,720
so assessing the the state you know is
it something that we should be concerned

352
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,350
about

353
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,390
sold what happened earlier was that was
Thursday or Friday

354
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:03,670
shell shock came out yet another
instance Microsoft going yea it was a

355
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,620
nice

356
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,710
Tom

357
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,240
but how many organizations had to do
effectively respond to that

358
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,800
that they know how to respond couple so

359
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,350
if we are able to get out in front of
that and say you know we can

360
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,430
definitively say this does not impact
our organization

361
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,220
yes it's occurring we can give that to
information and give that assurance for

362
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,010
our executive leadership management

363
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,650
soul timidly

364
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,610
what are the key aspects and I come from
from working with the department that's

365
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,170
where

366
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,980
information is sorta kinda useful um

367
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,380
but it has to be be able to be
actionable has to be operationalized

368
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,170
from a commercial aspect we have to look
at in the global view

369
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,760
so if we start saying things attacks
branch offices

370
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,410
or they're happening in locations where
we have a a business dependency on

371
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,270
we need to consider that as well as part
of our are threatened Elgin program

372
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,450
also must be flexible

373
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,640
we have to be able to adapt to be able
to respond to the number about specs

374
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,640
up from various threats and attacks so
from a dissemination getting information

375
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,410
out to to the organization on there's
really only two primary consumers

376
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,790
we have the actual business units the ok
so we support

377
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,120
on the folks that are kind enough to pay
our

378
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,560
salaries want to keep them happy right

379
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,940
will like our jobs right well we don't
like our jobs but we like having a

380
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,790
paycheck right

381
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:39,160
so we have to give them the ability to
make informed decisions

382
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,190
then we have the technical consumers
though the folks that will take the

383
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,980
information that we have to produce that
in a a fashion that will deliver

384
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,220
her protect the organization so from
business aspect

385
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,930
travel advisories

386
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,540
being able to sell you know we're a
country porch in attacks originating

387
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,730
from words perceived to be coming from

388
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,130
as well as the the general internet

389
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:13,300
for escape your whole year

390
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,500
that is not an invitation

391
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,420
you know your in if i cant

392
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,070
get another one I'm going to ask Dave to
come here and give me a hug

393
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,560
your ok because I'm a hug on the hut
that the Happy Hooker when I'm

394
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:36,560
have been drinking so firm in technical
aspect what can we turn around and do

395
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,750
news and information for

396
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:45,750
him

397
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,190
so we can create

398
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,570
router access control lists so this is
one of the things that when I came over

399
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,360
from

400
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,280
the Department events and that the
federal government that I found somewhat

401
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,040
hilarious

402
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,890
was the DOT has 10 see we block
everything and then you have to actually

403
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,970
justify why goes open commercially it's
like

404
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,000
we're gonna open everything and then
shut it down more told to do it

405
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,230
we can create router access control list

406
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:17,230
firewall now

407
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,550
with this make our job easier for rural
take that information

408
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,420
put it in so we don't have to deal with
it and respond to it because we don't

409
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,570
want to deal with that

410
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,640
we all like to talk about incident
response and forensics cuz those are the

411
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,290
cool things right that's what CSI and
NCIS made the teachers at that's where

412
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,850
the sexy stuff happens right

413
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:38,620
if you ever lived through an incident
it's not sexy

414
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,500
you'll spend a lot of time banging your
head against a wall

415
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,610
hair on fire being told by by

416
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:50,780
somebody that it will be okay usually
when you're told it will be okay that's

417
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,910
the code word for

418
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:56,980
your resume updated your but what if we
can

419
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,020
we could actually take the information
we've got and a flyer

420
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,160
blouse to prepare

421
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,800
preemptively mitigate some of these
threats that were facing

422
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,090
allows to do some enhanced monitoring so
with

423
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,570
shell-shocked coming out I'm some other
the signatures

424
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,690
%ah that are being made available we can
actually start looking and

425
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:26,690
following right we can see if we start
to see that Traficant organization

426
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,870
which allows for focused response

427
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,909
we can actually take the steps

428
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:37,340
to get out in front of these that we
were not you working until three o'clock

429
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,370
in the morning

430
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,740
so why an initially started developing
this

431
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,820
again this was a proof-of-concept

432
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,070
and a project in

433
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,470
that that I started a in my spare time

434
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,490
which we all have lots of spare time
right yeah

435
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,139
again free to require

436
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:04,130
acquire who in

437
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,240
y'all had fun last night now I'm gonna
happen this morning

438
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,679
your robust platform sport we're all

439
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:15,919
is there anybody in here to pose to two
open-source

440
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,090
now okay good so I don't have to sell
you on the

441
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,230
the idea I love this one

442
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,500
easy to use native tools right anybody
ever you said

443
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,750
talkin pearl at yeah

444
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,360
you work third shift don't you ok

445
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,120
but it allows for

446
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,159
for is automation as well so we can yes
are getting this information together

447
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,620
the open source community does not
suffer from a lack of tools

448
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:56,620
I didn't really come up Wales thinking
it would differently in my mind a

449
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:00,919
okay

450
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:05,490
sold I get an idea

451
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:09,519
which is never a good bank because I
still like to think that I'm as

452
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,960
technical as I i used to be but I am
like not so

453
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,539
I will bother people after a Google

454
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:22,289
so I started building this this
application that would actually start

455
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:25,010
going out and doing the heavy lifting
because I don't want to do this on a

456
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,980
reported basis

457
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,120
sir getting beads from different sources
that I'd found which

458
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,610
that's a lotta Google time um

459
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,960
although some the ads that would pop up
after I do the searchers was quite

460
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,710
unique

461
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,870
and they were not ones I can show on
public

462
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:48,100
while the key things that I'd mention
was a normalization information so all

463
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,470
these different formats whether they
were common in our says

464
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,200
EDS Gmail raw text documents I need to
put him in a way

465
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,549
that I can actually use it and then

466
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:00,690
but that information into a database
because you know that sexy

467
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,899
and then

468
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:08,299
as for getting the idea wall you know I
don't have to sit there and and

469
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:11,799
wary informational the Launcelot a meet
and greet a script that way

470
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:18,799
it'll provide media reports and then
provide geographical summers Asian

471
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:24,200
now at this point other than the

472
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,850
the public sources that I was point from
miles also calling in favors

473
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:32,570
and coercing some of my coworkers to
place

474
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,320
on honey pot so that provide them all
over the US

475
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,779
which by the way trying to get your
grandparents to understand what honey

476
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:44,399
pot is

477
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,950
not as easy as you would think

478
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,159
trust me Graham on just put it online

479
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,419
which you responded to with

480
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:58,170
are you always tell me not to click the
links yes hun

481
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:03,390
I'm not the bad guy so I actually
deployed at one point about 15 different

482
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,190
honeypots

483
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,370
across US geographically dispersed both
in commercial

484
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,820
which was really interesting because a
lot %uh the customers I was working with

485
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,570
they love the idea because I would share
that information back with them

486
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,810
so now they're like wait a minute I can
get additional information

487
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:25,250
and in the back my mind I'm hearing 43
him like a look at your

488
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,340
will do that but we have distributed
just like that you need to be able to

489
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,610
wait to get back to

490
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,230
to the hype anybody know where this from
very

491
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,920
had no reason eke car gets pulled today
I gave that to a bunch of waters and

492
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,730
they looked at me like I was insane and
I was like yeah this is why don't like

493
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,530
auditors

494
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:48,220
so I needed a method to get all the
information back

495
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,520
aggregate the information normalize it

496
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,150
process and provide the the altman
management

497
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,160
report back to me which was nothing more
than a a script or HTML

498
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:06,160
file Tom because I'm lazy so ultimately
in this world and try and do

499
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,890
a present demonstration so hang on with
me

500
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,020
so why the applications that I came
acrossed

501
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:19,620
during this little application

502
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,100
from the folks in the collective
intelligence premark

503
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:27,010
anybody ever hear them couple

504
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:32,240
these guys are awesome okay

505
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,790
that's not working actually probably
work but I'm on my second Smirnoff

506
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:44,600
in now

507
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,580
what's that down

508
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,790
new noted

509
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,200
luv you meet him um

510
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,750
so basically what it would the
collective intelligence frame

511
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,190
framework allows you to do I am yep

512
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:05,650
allows you to do is pull that
information and normal %ah

513
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,300
didn't get into a normal mice passions
that we can get into the database

514
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,350
but they've also builds really unique
functionality like

515
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,930
the ability to pipe that too

516
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,970
om are welcome and set so things like

517
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,960
you know I P tables essayist

518
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,610
and being able to dump that information
out and

519
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,190
have something that you can put into
your production network to

520
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:36,150
to protect against somebody sites have
been identified and I can do that with

521
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:36,910
the

522
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,830
the online demo the smear on

523
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,260
is up attacking and winning

524
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,590
um however

525
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,760
it allows you'll great flexibility
seeking polling firm Asian around

526
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,630
specifically around remains

527
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:58,720
vision campaigns all these different
things which I think was really cool

528
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,240
because you can't turn around and you
know generate signatures for you for

529
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,200
your ideas

530
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,409
I'll so that way you know that that
would make your life easier

531
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:11,500
the we knew something like shell-shocked
was an impact as we can actually

532
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,300
identify

533
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,090
where attacks are coming from and be
able to get out and run that so that way

534
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:17,620
we're

535
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,600
you know being able to attend dirty
comments have been on the phone during

536
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,190
Derby calmness in the talks

537
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,409
om

538
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:27,629
however I had I did have a colleague of
mine who said this is great if you're at

539
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:28,730
the command line

540
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:33,629
om how do you represent those two
management

541
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:37,599
well having spent the last several years
I've

542
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,950
my life working in a management
consulting I was like Google I know how

543
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,260
to answer that question

544
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:46,940
ok we make dashboards with pretty colors

545
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,570
I'll and because is definitely we want
with the black motif right because all

546
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,950
hackers use green and black background

547
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:57,280
but we were able to too quickly

548
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,820
visualize the information and present
that in a way that we can actually drill

549
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,359
down into that information

550
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:06,320
and not to be done at outdone by fire I
even though they have better

551
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,010
%uh presentation I can also view maps to

552
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,410
and I can tell you from the

553
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,570
aspectos where attacks are coming from

554
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,770
now again this is all open source

555
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,900
tools so if you

556
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,060
are so inclined you can actually develop
thus for yourself and Howson

557
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:35,060
be able to act on this one other things
that we did was pulling out information

558
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:40,450
on on number uva honeypots specifically
in this case for

559
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:44,359
four specific antibodies answer
correlating

560
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:47,880
things like common thread actors you
know who's touching one

561
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,770
so we see number systems on the outlying
areas and I don't usually

562
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,440
are usually middle point on however
there's a

563
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,520
single red actor in the middle and
within those distributed honeypots

564
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,170
different network segments are different
commercial providers

565
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,690
residential systems we saw 8 I P e's

566
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,950
they were attacking all four so now

567
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,180
where can I focus my efforts at maybe I
should be concerned about those

568
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,680
8 that are targeting geographically
dispersed different networks

569
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,530
might be something worth looking into

570
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,160
so well the prof concept was based on
public and private data feeds public

571
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,150
being anything that I can pull down suck
down on the Internet

572
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,579
in private data feeds being my honey pot
point that I had

573
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:37,720
which came out with a lot

574
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,609
data but it was able to produce known
bad IP addresses

575
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:47,819
that actors known bad URL's places we
should not serve on the Internet

576
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:51,359
who was active

577
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,230
and where the commonalities lie because
I can tell you that if

578
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:58,700
you know you will always have
opportunistic scanners that we're going

579
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,520
to be out there just

580
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,920
you looking for open systems however
when you can

581
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,170
tie that to you we're seeing this
activity

582
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:10,750
hit multiple areas and this is the
common thread 0 actor

583
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,470
then we can start taking a little bit
more proactive approach on how we

584
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,230
protect things

585
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:21,230
sign

586
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,260
there so originally

587
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,520
when I started building this II build
the sound above spare parts

588
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,280
on things that were just lying around my
lab and put this together

589
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,160
sorted the again using some other native
tools

590
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,220
anybody in here for overseas Python

591
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,839
where my pearl people at fell

592
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,839
were my pythons were dying breed on
leave her house

593
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,890
will be around 11 here

594
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:02,640
we are the the next COBOL love were the
Internet white 3k

595
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,690
um so started

596
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,990
started developing some other than
aspects around this on

597
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:13,220
again nothing fancy found out that I was
processing

598
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,340
on average about 700 and 900 megs of
data

599
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:21,410
per hour which thats aggregating the
information scrubbing and sanitizing

600
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,980
minute removing duplicates

601
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,500
some in getting it back down to the

602
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:32,630
the aspectos being able to manage so
strategically I was able to see who's

603
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,520
looked interesting little mean

604
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,530
able to identify new attack profile
someone who once

605
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:42,230
and I don't have time to to get into it
today how many view remember the answer

606
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,930
via Yahoo stuff that happened back

607
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:48,820
last year couple I actually have

608
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,130
evidence of the attack occurring back in

609
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:57,500
October I'll based upon what I'd seen
from some others often I was like

610
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,120
at the time I was like okay I'm seeing
somebody trying to work force as i dont

611
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,770
matter

612
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,230
no big deal and then when the the news
broke about the EU servers over

613
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,530
for ya who had servers getting not
compromise being leverage for bitcoins

614
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,270
attacks

615
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,290
it made sense I was like wow this is
cool didn't have all the information

616
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,570
available at the time

617
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,950
again

618
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,570
identifying malicious of course it's
amazing what happens when you put out a

619
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,260
system that will answer

620
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,460
like Microsoft certs it will accept
exploits all day long

621
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,740
which is great because now we can start
analyzing that and seeing what it

622
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,630
actually does

623
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:38,240
as well as putting in my arsenal to use
its clients

624
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,950
planned mitigation

625
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,900
efforts how to protect myself 20 dad
more by will Wilson Chandler need to

626
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:52,710
monitor for specific traffic again

627
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:59,710
ability to update the lead-in to find
our quickly now one other things and

628
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,500
that was built into the platform was he
be able

629
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,310
ability to take md5sum earn a shot one

630
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,830
and for that and say okay is this has
been seen anywhere else

631
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,110
yes now if the GS mmm

632
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:20,800
need to take a little bit more look into
it and draw maps of interest

633
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,820
because I'm a geek so one of the things
that I did it was over a three-month

634
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,330
period

635
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,370
om from ninety different systems being
able to

636
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:33,780
gather that log data together and
actually start analyzing it what I

637
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,640
discovered

638
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,280
was that ability to identify maps

639
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,980
are up now while maps right no domains

640
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,410
that had a flag from the the traffic
that I'd collected

641
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:51,320
om ultimately when I was able to still
that down to was that three required

642
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,260
additional

643
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,480
looking into because there was no way I
could reset back to

644
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,820
an event occurring on my network that
had gone out for that call so

645
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:07,240
actually looking into it and then from
an IP specific standpoint in

646
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,490
was able to look at how many people were
trying to come in as well as

647
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,840
what systems were being called out which
we were able actually identified on my

648
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,790
daughter's

649
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:19,000
laptop she'd been infected om

650
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,330
which was kinda cool the back to the
original question

651
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:30,779
oh my goodness is just

652
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:37,779
me for for I'm looking at it on here and
it's like my women

653
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:46,799
messy up there and the ice but getting
back to the the core aspects when I was

654
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:47,559
able to those

655
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,189
to be able to find got these are
horrible

656
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:54,819
om was answering the question no

657
00:41:54,819 --> 00:41:58,509
%uh who would attack as well if you're
on the internet guess what target you

658
00:41:58,509 --> 00:41:59,539
were one

659
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:03,140
om that there's no such thing as having
a

660
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,949
a small footprint you're not on
anybody's radar that's

661
00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:12,329
misnomer in but unfortunately management
in our leadership sometimes actually

662
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,219
believes that

663
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:17,499
were small regional organization who
would be interested in us

664
00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:20,789
has anybody ever heard that never right

665
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:24,689
your now

666
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:28,640
that brought up another aspect
understanding

667
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,380
you know why is it that were targets

668
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:39,380
well the this is an aspect that when we
talk with executive leadership we need

669
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:41,959
to convey is that

670
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:45,400
the data that we're handling is not
necessarily the same thing that

671
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,609
criminals are looking at

672
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:50,779
criminals very rarely are actually
concerned with just the credit card data

673
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:54,419
they want to monetize the asset and for
those of you are familiar with this this

674
00:42:54,419 --> 00:42:54,969
is

675
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:58,909
you guys know Brian Krebs might've heard
a rumble God

676
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,849
so we're this is the value back to PC

677
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:06,819
to a criminal organization and what they
will use a

678
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:11,769
or so we got everything from hosting
child porn which

679
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:14,339
thats they'll be a bum wanna come in on
Monday morning by the secret service

680
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,489
there to

681
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:22,489
you know apps honor our systems
accessing corporate email because that

682
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:29,679
would never happen right

683
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,859
Imperial Crypt the locker

684
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,970
in how do you handle that did you pay
the finer did you

685
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:40,299
just say was at restore from backup

686
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:47,299
he also

687
00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:00,259
criminals look at at our system lot
differently than just

688
00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:04,339
what we have yell

689
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:08,539
turning our citizens they will make
money off more networks

690
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:14,920
of our assets whether it's for

691
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,049
direct access to Jakarta learn
information if your PC ir medical

692
00:44:19,049 --> 00:44:20,250
records for medical

693
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,859
on health care industry they will

694
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:28,730
find a way to make money off that
because that their

695
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:32,509
a computer asset on your network is
criminal currency they can't read that

696
00:44:32,509 --> 00:44:39,380
sold mainly what I accomplish in all
this

697
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,009
like wanna buy the there is a bed

698
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:47,589
bad things happen on the Internet now
that shouldn't shock most the bus

699
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:51,000
however we start talking with management
leadership

700
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,740
me it tends to shot them very much um

701
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,980
yelled being able to pull public
information out and and distill then

702
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,140
into an aspect

703
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,779
that we can convey a message to our
leadership in our technical side of the

704
00:45:04,779 --> 00:45:05,220
house

705
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,589
to protect organizations as possible a
benefit

706
00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:13,210
we can bring actual value because a lot
of the time security is seen as anybody

707
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,400
in here and seen as like the the good
guys

708
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,210
1

709
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:21,670
to 3 normally security we in in

710
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,960
Pesek we have this were always the guys
that say no

711
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,799
and really that's not our job our job is
to educate

712
00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:31,839
document as Clayton in allow the

713
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,019
the business to make the decision the
being able to provide additional value

714
00:45:36,019 --> 00:45:37,720
to the organization

715
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,950
and being able to demonstrate that to
them is

716
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:47,950
is a double win for us sold mainly what
I ended up learning out of all this

717
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:51,920
and what that says is that size matters

718
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,170
from although my slides or are messed up

719
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,109
where is it actually the ice is is
collagen can you

720
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:04,650
your you know

721
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,759
being a beloved to find out that the
information

722
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:14,239
associated with what that was all my
network was again spent a lot of time

723
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,400
trying to track down a ghost I P you're

724
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,930
or was I able to have the context in up
to you to say

725
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:24,140
definitely yes i'm saying traffic going
out to a commanding control network

726
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,420
and I have evidence a unknown bad piece
on our on that system

727
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,369
oh wow this is horrible

728
00:46:32,369 --> 00:46:38,850
I did not

729
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:45,850
know what happened with my presentation
well that's the bad part is I would

730
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,120
normally agree with you but

731
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:54,720
it's a a Mac PowerPoint thank you for
the save

732
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:01,720
in it's not working

733
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:07,880
again so becoming a business enabler

734
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,210
and being able report so issuing travel
advisories

735
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,650
this is something that always cracks me
up is what do I need a travel advisory

736
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,470
only going to beijing

737
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,280
so little known

738
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,180
little little thing that I love to tell
people because I actually had an

739
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,120
executive call me up afterwards I was
like

740
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,130
so when you're in the airport in Beijing
do not use the photocopier

741
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:34,690
is like home why not they will offer to
you for free

742
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,970
they're stealing your information
Educare night

743
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:42,110
you don't know what you're talking about
really okay cool he gets back from his

744
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,990
trip he's like you're right they
actually have free copiers all over the

745
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,260
airport nasa yep

746
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:50,640
and how many copies did you make
money-making

747
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,290
how many copies did you make was nothing
critical

748
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,260
was a business-related walls are sales
forecast

749
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,820
a Wow

750
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:09,680
okay cool but being able to identify
also information around

751
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,730
point point on her peer to peer networks
as well as core activity

752
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,470
now tour supporting writer allows us to
have anonymity

753
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,930
is there's an actual business function

754
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:25,140
short war so if you start identifying
systems

755
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,980
coming from poor exit nodes and touching
your network what might that be an

756
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,200
indicator up

757
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:35,670
this your bank reach out to you

758
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,560
be added for network now

759
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,790
in probably scare you the dead right
your

760
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:45,590
but also you know one other things that
that

761
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:50,370
we also discovered was will both take a
look at our own internal IP addresses in

762
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:51,090
our own

763
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:55,770
domains am we had actually come across
organizations that had been identified

764
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,590
as

765
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:01,520
spam relays and these are not from like
10 years ago these were like

766
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,060
current and they start taking look
because oh my god

767
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,850
we have a lot of mail traffic going
through your om

768
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:12,780
and then they discovered oh yes by the
way yet we still had an open relay

769
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,790
one its 2014 right in another ruling

770
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:20,150
cool so again

771
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:23,250
threat intelligence mitigation efforts
with that actually turns into

772
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:26,540
things that you can actually do walk
away from

773
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:32,640
actionable great fire I tells you you
know the the issuance Brett map & and

774
