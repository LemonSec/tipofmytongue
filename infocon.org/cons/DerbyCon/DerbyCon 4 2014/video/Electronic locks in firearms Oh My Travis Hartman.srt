1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,089
heard coming and I got one of the great
times for presentation

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:08,099
so like the last one of the day I'm
which I don't know if that sucks worse

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,330
than the ones that are

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,509
for Saturday morning when people are
hungover or right after one should any

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,059
given day

6
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:16,910
so thanks for coming into early skills
little time for you go slight

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,830
show roulette and I will try not to
killing more brain cells and you may

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,430
have already done at the bar

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,189
last year we managed to not drink them

10
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:31,740
out of all the alcohol we did two years
ago so the challenge is still there

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,309
are in der so if you have a territory do

12
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,680
hope that the bar at least go make some
donations actors Richard

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,700
think it's all my public service
announcement so

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,379
I'm Travis Hartman and I'm presenting on
electronique safeties and firearms

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,219
a sorry it was up to avoid the in years
signature claims I'm a owner built

16
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,250
firearms and a spokesperson for a
company yes I have a clinic for a crazy

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,969
whatever else that I work with so just
bizarre stuff

18
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:05,610
anything i'm talking about. terms
electronics eighties they may not be

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,270
appropriate for all users in all
situations

20
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,210
that's something that a lot of the
industry is had

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,450
arguments debates name-calling about

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,130
they say well in this one situation or
whatever else honestly I don't want

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,830
or fun let's get to the point where
maybe you have an option to have it at

24
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,330
some point

25
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,820
30

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,140
one thing I have learned is that you
have to have

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,450
ponies or something I'm and

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,810
this is the closest thing I could come
up with pony into a fire or

29
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,060
so high it now check that I do have
three pony slides throughout the

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,299
presentation because

31
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:50,770
user three-party minimum I don't know to
get the day's

32
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,250
so targets

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,270
if you watch a movies the 80's 90's

34
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:04,020
last decade you've probably seen some
source worked

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,799
go it a BSEE Judge Dredd with

36
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,940
stallone no what the law bring your the
lawgiver knees like to hear

37
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,440
the order dated for lotto double-whammy
okay that's what hurts more guys are

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,920
that's that's pretty cool a but what's
actually been offered up their stuff

39
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,330
like

40
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,560
it's a magnet rings soda cracker jacks

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,890
found all sorry solution its single
factors week at the occasion

42
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,950
prices to be clear gonna be 50 percent
more baby double the price is just the

43
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,870
firearm alone

44
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,650
what time is reduced functionality to
see including a couple examples that we

45
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,430
have here

46
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,950
this one magnetic ring

47
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,519
so it's a really high tech solution you
have to have a ring that I magnin

48
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,489
and if you put your hand on it it'll let
you fire it or in that case you have to

49
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:55,530
put your hand on it

50
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,810
move the lever and then it'll stay on
locked into you put

51
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,260
ring with the mag didn't move it again
and then it would be

52
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,489
locked again because thats much quicker
a much safer than somebody

53
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,920
just flipping a lever with her thong

54
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,019
you the one in the lower right that is
the the high-tech approach

55
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:17,319
and its by company called architects

56
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,349
it cost about one thousand three hundred
ninety nine dollars

57
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,590
in the watch which actually does have
fingerprint sensor looks extremely

58
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,760
geeky is another four hundred dollars so

59
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,730
rather than somebody going out and
spending four hundred dollars to buy

60
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,690
semi-automatic handgun there now looking
at eighteen hundred dollars

61
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,569
because anybody that buys a firearm

62
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,810
definitely has in extra-inning fourteen
hundred dollars

63
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,290
laying around that prices no benefit
burdeau

64
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,549
mission

65
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,349
another without solutions out there is
called the kodiak it provides a retrofit

66
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:56,040
so

67
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,920
the Colt 1911 format the really it's a
hundred replace your old design

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,580
this is replacing the grip frame for the
grip on it uses the same grip frame

69
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,569
but it's adding some biometric
authentication what's gets about four

70
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,360
hundred dollars

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,019
what cheaper than the archer exclusion
but still it's just that

72
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,479
and something is bothering with a right
look at all these things is it's always

73
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,799
the fire our company or who are the
manufacturers are trying to address

74
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,530
everything they're saying okay I'm not
just gonna dress my firearm manufacturer

75
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,240
address

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,620
electronics or address the security
electronics or address the

77
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,699
interoperability

78
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,310
and working with the other people have
been involved with

79
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,740
that was something that really robust
wrong way you go to any the sessions

80
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,020
and eat are you people were in there
looking about whether it's stuff that's

81
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,600
in the network in your household
refrigerators talking on the network or

82
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,960
courses there's a lot of very smart
people I'm sure there's

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,770
love you in here that have different
ideas are different approaches the way

84
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,449
you I do

85
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,690
smart gun implementation so we has why
do we take a look at this look at the

86
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,360
problems

87
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,759
see how we can break that apart so that
we can actually provide a platform

88
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,250
so that you or you being the earliest

89
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,620
the Royal you get had ability go ahead
and design your electronics module

90
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,729
and have a way to just plug it in into a
comment I prefer far

91
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,259
so forget to how we're going to do that

92
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,030
what are the issues out there in the
biggest thing that's been stopping smart

93
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,780
gun adoption in the US

94
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,830
has been the New Jersey and this law's
been around since I believe 2002

95
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,900
what it says is minutes any smart guns
are for sale

96
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,930
in the US anywhere in the US

97
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,060
then that starts the clock right and
within three years

98
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,270
all-new handguns sold in New Jersey have
to harass your gun technology

99
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,729
which is skyward they don't care about
how good it works

100
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:52,660
they don't care how reliable it is they
don't care if it's actually available in

101
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,479
their state with the largest record

102
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,910
and its source that happening also was a
lot manufactures and individually absorb

103
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,960
the cost and risk the research so

104
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,590
one manufacturer says he I want to deal
with this i would offer smart gun

105
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,889
r-texas tried it there are a couple
other are

106
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,490
companies who tried it and pretty much
what happens is they get shut out by a

107
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,050
your special interest groups are there
be picketing at any stores that carry

108
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,530
their

109
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,009
their firearms and it turns out to not
be well for them Colt

110
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:26,030
believe it was heady CEO rar

111
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,300
ask who are not richer after E yep
talked about possibly supports Morgan

112
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,729
Research

113
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:38,639
K second mandatory and pony picture

114
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,430
change

115
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,580
Kelsey me from Brenda ready who's
looking at farms

116
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,840
back in 99 this is the last time the
firearms industry really start to take a

117
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
look at

118
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,190
and what they basically said is
something the proponents was more guns

119
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,740
were looking at as an alternate way to
keep things protected person wealthy guy

120
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,830
smart technology is okay to go and keep
a round in the chamber

121
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,009
keep it low did you not to do any of the
other stuff you doing right

122
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:06,380
may be keeping it safe or or doing other
locks

123
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,090
so that was say that was issuing damn

124
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,449
so 99 fifteen years ago

125
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,970
that was only last look at it so it is
not there well I think

126
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,110
miniaturization the state a technology
is advanced a little bit since

127
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,990
Windows ME although no organization so
using wins

128
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,180
and so what do we take a look at what we
can do to

129
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,770
as anybody in here heard the smart tech
childish

130
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,620
okay cricket cricket cricket so there is
an angel investor and had to get

131
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,990
for gun reforming Ron Conway he is the
main backer at the smart tech

132
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,759
foundation they've awarded a million
dollars in grants

133
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,979
to foster innovation or foster do things
are to be happening out there it's

134
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:52,419
marked

135
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,970
the first one they have the competition
earlier this year there there's been one

136
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,990
grant has been announced there's been

137
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,280
a bunch of the acts are you were
selected notifications that went out

138
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,270
I really believe in the next 12-18
months what they're doing is going to

139
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,900
lead to sales in the US

140
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,509
the picture there on the right that is a
3d-printed

141
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,970
a gun it is not designed to actually

142
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,740
fully fire but it is designed by
17-year-old in colorado is saying is

143
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,169
biometric sensors got ninety percent
accuracy

144
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:28,479
well doesn't say is that your worst
crossover error rate is is that

145
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,959
up false negatives false-positive years
and say anything about that is ninety

146
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,120
percent accuracy

147
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,979
on the sensors what is claiming and he's
getting pretty close and is

148
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,719
the design for all the parts

149
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,410
what's he can do is if he gets his FFL
license

150
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,370
and even sells the design in the US to
somebody else so that they could print

151
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,990
out their own parts

152
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,810
that counts is this Morgan said and that
will trigger the New Jersey

153
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,089
so something else would need to happen
industries where to look at something

154
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,279
different so they can actually have a
challenge that

155
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,390
New Jersey

156
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,920
and so the working on a framework got
three different components to

157
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,230
one for the hardware we're going to
actually do that chunk a metal the thing

158
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,390
that was things go bang in fly out it

159
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,570
hi speaks what do they do for the
electronics so that we can actually

160
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,320
control things and that and the
licensing how are we going to make this

161
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,410
so that is going to actually work for
the manufacturers was going to work for

162
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,480
the

163
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,940
yeah I'm going to generically for to use
the the hackers and people who might be

164
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,519
doing something with the electronics
there

165
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,160
how we're going to deal will help all
those groups be able to work together

166
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,350
first thing we've been working with his
ar-15 patter

167
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,060
so everybody it has seen I'm sure an
ar-15 or

168
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,310
m16 or something is the scary black

169
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,910
but the a big piece apart with the
serial numbers lower receiver

170
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:00,010
and that is the parts that is regulated
that's where yet to help the

171
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:05,130
go through the year background check
each we go buy a new one

172
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,200
but nice thing about that is also has
these

173
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,970
it's a disorder which in and of itself
isn't terribly scary

174
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,899
but it does have some extra space so
it's hollow in there there's not any

175
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:16,870
moving parts

176
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,829
and that's going to give this place
where we can actually put electronics

177
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:22,410
and as we continue to work on getting
think smaller

178
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,110
but it's a lot of free play area and so
people are saying I would be as a hobby

179
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,390
is go out there

180
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,810
and interface with what's going to
happen in the rest the firearm

181
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,140
why don't I take something that's got
the most space and we'll work with that

182
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,140
rather than start

183
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,440
with something that's really tight like
a semi-automatic pistol

184
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,089
somethings me to have a need to have a
server or so annoyed most likely scandia

185
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:46,010
latching solenoid

186
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,899
needs will interact with two with the
disconnect are the trigger safety or

187
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,480
some other component in there they
actually prevents it from fiery

188
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,950
and since we're working we're not
designing

189
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,760
firearms that we have to be able to
transfer the dimensions that we come up

190
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,880
with two other manufacturers we have
reference points

191
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,190
base of the standard your pic mil-spec
design

192
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,620
as well as the pistol grips the group
left to be

193
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,589
slightly redesigned talking to actually
go to the people that work in the maker

194
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,860
space upstairs they

195
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,079
bill savior's something like this will
take about four hours to print out

196
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,810
depending on the complexity

197
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,760
the most what they're printing this is
going to have the structural strength to

198
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,140
be able to handle

199
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,779
are the little bit the impact is going
to get from the report so

200
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:31,370
so you ought to predicting up to make a
small mold then you ought to be able to

201
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:31,980
cast that

202
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,310
all stuff you can do at home but is
going to take a few hours

203
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:41,320
are probably in a couple days time for a
weekend to

204
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,930
are anybody here take the time to cut in
AR and half

205
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,880
and there okay as anybody explain to
their spouse

206
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,120
why they're buying firearms they can cut
them in half

207
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,380
for after a

208
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,880
guess how well that was received your

209
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,790
so inches and you're not even been to
the concert drinking so I don't know

210
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,700
what your

211
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,519
but this is the the basic design what's
happening with

212
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,320
the and use very

213
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,810
so this channel

214
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,149
long channel you see right there that is
where there's a ball

215
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,079
goes from the River area into the lower
see

216
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,540
this is the trigger this is the safety
the safety purvis the trigger from

217
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,320
rising

218
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,389
told rotated is cut a notch cut into it

219
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:37,170
in the trigger can rise up in that area
once the safety is turned into the fire

220
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,860
position

221
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,860
sort somewhere in there is what we have
to be a winner at

222
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,660
close a structural thing that we've been
able to work with is

223
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,720
a channel right there it's gonna be a
whole

224
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,990
Drupal will be providing 3d printable
Jake so if you take in a are you can

225
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,089
print the GX

226
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:02,279
you consider the whole you can take a
drill press or

227
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,529
hand roll probably prefer lead rope rest
and

228
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:09,839
drawl the on your own hole in an AR and
then you'll be able to practice with the

229
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,180
electronics

230
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,459
socially what's going to happen it will
take also slight modification to the

231
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:15,870
back

232
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,639
trigger but it the

233
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,529
the pushrod will rise through the
channel a gate to the back to trigger

234
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:29,170
and do the rotational direction sexually
could be perpendicular to the rotational

235
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:29,810
direction

236
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,190
the trigger and it will prevent you from
be able to pull the trigger

237
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,079
okay great so draw one whole maybe have
a slight modification to trigger an

238
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,269
arkansas doing things

239
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,560
the electronics will pass those
directions

240
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,180
those dimensions over the manufacture
they want to use them

241
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,389
because I can't give out the entire AR

242
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:53,630
lower receiver dimensions the ATF says
that would be

243
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:59,199
disseminating or selling a firearm I it
comes in the international traffic in

244
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,060
arms regulations get treated with that
one

245
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,470
and I really don't want to get my house
raided so what we will do is provide the

246
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,470
jigsaw if you want to modify your own
work with a great if your manufacturer

247
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,180
we will provide two dimensional
specifications so that you can do the of

248
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:19,149
certain incorporated into your own
feelings ups

249
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,399
so look at the PCB typically and
designing and the print circuit boards

250
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,360
it's got a steep learning curve doing in
small volumes as expense

251
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,589
for will provide that information but
most likely provide a reference works

252
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:31,029
well

253
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,440
so you'll have some ability to take a

254
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,820
reference board will be looking at
probably an Arduino that way you can

255
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,720
have something it's fairly easy to work
with it's not the most power efficient

256
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
way to do it

257
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,269
but nobody's home to learn some leeway
which that way

258
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:52,620
and due to I was told to get bonus
points if we have the air make a

259
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,980
Japanese CISSP

260
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,110
so I'm included that one in there

261
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,589
ordered great

262
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:04,820
you can already that's credit right
actual perfect

263
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,430
so what we're it is worth it that's what
we've got

264
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,010
love the initial design with then we
would take that

265
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,649
no run it through another package that
letters lay out the circuit board what

266
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,329
has to go where on the circuit board

267
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:22,449
my don't worry we'll get stuff on the
web site you'll have access to it

268
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:25,529
or you can just look pretty colors are

269
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:28,420
but you're able to look at the different
parties there right now this one is

270
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,089
about us

271
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,480
point seven inches wide worry quarter to
stall your

272
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,389
spaces for LED indicator so you can have
it indicate

273
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:41,699
it's locked it's not locked I like
having two killers washing whichever

274
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,470
reach the microcontroller voltage
regulator in the battery and servo

275
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,430
most likely he is going to be or do you
know Provo 3.3 volts

276
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,329
that's going to use one question we have
in this is something I I'm really happy

277
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:59,500
with where technology is

278
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,199
the power thats then a big pain in the
ass as we've been trying to figure out

279
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,600
how to do this

280
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,279
in general so they say well I would have
a firearm or

281
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,300
are you up a police officer in the
vehicle they've got their

282
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,480
service rifle and nobody wants to go say
OK at the end of the day what do you

283
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,310
have to do

284
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,940
to go home I have to plug in my phone I
have to go plug in my rightful so that I

285
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,889
can unlock it tomorrow

286
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:29,230
and just the natural serbia was other
things like damn Wear Daily the rifles

287
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,279
in the couch cushions

288
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,560
a you know it's 3am much credence to the
rightful

289
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,660
its just bad things that happen with
that

290
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,839
so you that's that's real concern but

291
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,509
with the the wireless charging and
there's definitely been some advances

292
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,589
with that

293
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,769
so if it gets too where they can say
you're worth it

294
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:53,459
using the police officer example when
they put it in the vehicle

295
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,910
if it's charging right next to the the
handle

296
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,209
and it doesn't actually have to have
physical contact is charging the surface

297
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:00,839
charging

298
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,230
awesome cool maybe somebody in their gun
safe

299
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,559
when he put the the right away it keeps
a charge

300
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:12,559
and his you're running this with a the
processor a full load all the time

301
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,079
you're going to get a few days battery
life out if you're using something

302
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,160
other than the Arduino wary you're
actually

303
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,980
dealing with the a their differ
microprocessor you can get a whole lot

304
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,410
more battery life

305
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,919
it's going to take some more time to
figure out the program what would be

306
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,500
good though she can work with the basic
reference board we haven't come up with

307
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,169
his dancers the warning for parade

308
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:37,650
figure out the form factors do those
type things and then transition from

309
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,280
that

310
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,799
into something that's going to our let
you have a little more power

311
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,580
your maintenance management with that
with anyways outgoing familiar with the

312
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,390
CR 123 of a

313
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,850
know somebody is man with a beard actual
so it's a a little shorter little fatter

314
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,960
than a AA battery

315
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,360
and it lasts a lot longer

316
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,470
ok so look at so the defrost as we have
with electronics

317
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,880
working on the reference board we're
going to have a USB

318
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,960
for wired connectivity we're debating on
whether or not to do a white fire

319
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,510
Bluetooth give you that option for the
wireless

320
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:23,250
eggs for the reference any preferences
from people here

321
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,580
WiFi Bluetooth don't care okay

322
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,360
Austin yeah look good

323
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,650
or okay then in the essays repertoire if
you don't enable it

324
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,039
be don't label or you don't you don't
add up are soldered on their

325
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,520
but I appreciate hearing multiple people
saying the same thing

326
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,830
accuses idea corrections you

327
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,330
they were actually looking at the group
itself if it's got a USB connector where

328
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,440
is that gonna need to be

329
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,160
that's probably something that his will
will release the the grid files

330
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,530
see you can modify that as well is going
to have a couple things are going to be

331
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,820
pretty static which is the hole in the
middle

332
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,030
and the mounting screw locations for the
circuit board

333
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,929
but other than that you can you change
the outside shape to change where you

334
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:09,179
are

335
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,150
well I got the LED's but I want to have
it on the back at the gretna

336
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:18,240
or the site a grip to do is rush or wire
in place it somewhere else on that

337
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,740
one thing we want to hear yes we're
looking at is like well

338
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,880
okay whatever somebody's unlocking it we
don't want to do in that the look sky

339
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,080
Walker lightsaber thing like well

340
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,549
for look down the barrel and try
impressive that that seem like it was

341
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:33,010
going to be a short-lived

342
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:36,549
approach

343
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:40,000
said mars ok

344
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,880
so licensing this is the part where

345
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,960
we think that we might be able to
actually gets manufactures abaya

346
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,500
licensing three there are two pay
anything for

347
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,780
much like a road open source software
licensing

348
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,950
if you take your technology from this
you do for the development on it

349
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,179
is set to release a backup to the
community let them to continue develop

350
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:04,880
with

351
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,789
one restriction that we won't have the
licensing any components that you're

352
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,630
saying they are compliant with the
framework

353
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,870
you're not allowed to sell them in a
jurisdiction where it mandates the use a

354
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,260
smart guns

355
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,179
that create an interesting challenge in
new jersey

356
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,890
there's any minute manufactures that
sign up for that then they can't be sold

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,610
in Jersey so state laws interfering with
their city

358
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,020
commerce because a private contract

359
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,549
the license itself are you not sure how
the lawyers would settle at one but I

360
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:37,539
think it would be an interesting
challenge their

361
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:40,880
but also manufacturers are looking at
him they say you know what

362
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,230
I'm not going to do anything myself but
police GRI without licensing that

363
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,900
framework

364
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,880
that will provide a little more support
more opportunity for people to go out

365
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,039
there and look at the different things
that they can do

366
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:55,640
you can do and come up with different
technologies

367
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,840
really I would like to see somebody in
five years and say you know what

368
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,929
we took his basic stuff and now you can
go get the open-source references you

369
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:10,440
can build your own law breaker

370
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,020
so future goals what do I owe continue
to refine the components

371
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,289
we're pretty close he saw from the cat
files on on what needs to happen with

372
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:18,880
that

373
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,520
photo/keith in the next few weeks we can
get a grip reference designs to working

374
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:22,870
on

375
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,440
exactly how we would have the way out to
the PCB

376
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,000
I I would guess that a reference PCB

377
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,409
in small runs going to be in two hundred
fifty dollar range

378
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:38,590
including the composer's populated Lisa
it's a target right now

379
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,880
so we're looking at doing that not make
any profit on it but be able to get it

380
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,419
out there for people who actually mark
with

381
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:48,039
because marking with things is a very
good term to use with firearms

382
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:53,070
in if anybody's lawyer has a friend that
a lawyer or

383
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,650
would like to be a lawyer were looking
for help with getting the licensing

384
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,080
working in there

385
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,130
we we've got some legal support on that

386
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,799
but everything will be doing its been
self-funded it's been us in our

387
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,090
spare time and you even our our legal
support it when people have been

388
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,770
volunteering so any

389
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,049
additional stuff you can do with that
they would be awesome

390
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,659
product testing if you say you know what
I don't want actually mess with the

391
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:18,600
circuit boards but

392
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,470
I'd be happy to test the chicks I got
this X-ray are

393
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,090
i knows I grew violate anything
structurally will be hidden by the group

394
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,409
when the group installed Snow but you'll
see it

395
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:32,169
but I'll make the the contribution to
the community are taking a half hour I

396
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:32,440
love

397
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,770
drilling a hole just seeing if some
parts of it that would be a huge day

398
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,270
I'm typically for me to get a it lower
receiver

399
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,289
this car cosmetic blemishes whatever
else

400
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:47,280
and paying sixty dollars plus lil bit
for shipping plus the fire our streets

401
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,230
an that adds up pretty quick

402
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,690
K up

403
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:01,340
so I had to have my my third party thing
in their eyes so I've got that

404
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,620
so please say hello to my little pony:

405
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,100
if you need to reach us there

406
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,220
so what always reaches I'm Facebook
Twitter Email

407
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,830
if you don't wanna if you want to use
wicker that we can you have your

408
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:21,049
on your messages deadly themselves after
an hour or whatever time period so you

409
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:24,280
have done plausible deniability the you
ever talk with us

410
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,210
you're more than welcome to use that I
got some business cards up here they

411
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,929
have all their contact information

412
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:34,580
your welcome to grab one of those

413
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,230
and your saw open up to any questions
and if there are any questions I do have

414
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,659
a good quote from general mattis

415
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:44,460
yes

416
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:51,460
yes

417
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,860
so that the group itself no a up the

418
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:05,120
the aluminum up the lower receiver the
ways positioned

419
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,559
the answer is it's not supposed to and
sold my engineer whose design

420
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,799
several lowers are done custom ones for
a few different companies

421
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,840
he's reassured me that that's

422
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,230
going to keep everything there as with
anything else

423
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,100
when the engineer tells you is
completely safe and it's going to work

424
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,960
II you love somebody owes some people
besides me to feel tests yeah

425
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,799
an you know what if your North Carolina
I live in North Carolina

426
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:37,279
I i do you want a quarter mile or
receivers after I get the hole drilled

427
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,010
in say here you go

428
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,860
you put it together go shoot at the
range smacked around 20

429
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,279
water you normally do with it to see
what happens

430
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:53,150
but for the most part it's not in they
make your solar receivers out a plastic

431
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:57,630
because it's not a high-impact area it
doesn't receive a lot of the stress is

432
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,279
the upper receiver it receives stresses
from the fire

433
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:04,850
lower receivers pretty much is holding
everything in place

434
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,000
after her any other questions

435
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,220
better so dirty so route

436
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,140
so to the very back the trigger
underneath the safety area so it's just

437
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,799
a small notch in the bottom up

438
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,730
and the only thing that would be weekend
is if

439
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,669
what your nine hundred-pound gorilla and
you're still trying to squeeze it

440
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:30,220
up into the safety area but the

441
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,390
angle the whole is perpendicular to the
curving path to the rotation at the

442
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,870
trigger

443
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,059
and select researcher force between the
pan

444
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:43,840
in the trigger itself and the pension
not be able to share because the way the

445
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,650
walls reinforcing it

446
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,770
and the trigger it it's got a lot of
material that would have to be able to

447
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,659
break through which

448
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,830
but at that point I think your player do
damage to the ER

449
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,919
the trigger pin itself that sir the
trigger rotates an

450
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,779
and Luscher with a Spartan there

451
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:09,179
0

452
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:14,580
way all

453
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,929
what with the or all

454
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:22,480
that's a great question and I look
forward to people that are working with

455
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,279
that coming up with three answers

456
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:29,309
I i jus wanna make it possible so people
can go a little start working with

457
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:33,909
an does if it was my car and I want to
go take her with that I can go buy lots

458
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:35,710
of things I can tinker with it every for

459
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:40,760
for the thing that goes boom I have had
in billion told out to do that

460
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,010
and there's to me when the back yes

461
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:50,909
the more

462
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:56,110
so the only connection between the a
receiver and the grip frame itself

463
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:00,730
black leaders to one's going to be the
pushrod and one's going to be the

464
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,210
and a the grid for screw

465
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,880
and typically not see much come down
through threats on the group's group

466
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,640
and I think it's going to be a minimal
now turn on will not that we actually be

467
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,169
able to make it through a straight red
rip it right on the pushrod

468
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:22,370
I will push that question back to my my
design engineer

469
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,809
and he'll say that's a great question we
probably a test that were

470
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:29,890
few thousand triples

471
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:36,890
there it watcher yes

472
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:44,429
yes

473
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:51,429
it

474
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,549
we're actually looking at having a the
are

475
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,289
small circlip though just provide is a
little bit a

476
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:04,159
spring force that will help disengage
from the trigger if

477
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,169
if needed

478
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:12,760
well it we don't make it easier to
disengage

479
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,909
but by looking at either servo or
latching solenoid

480
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:20,409
unless it gets power applied to it it's
not going to move from either position

481
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:23,480
so if you have it unlocked in the
battery died

482
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,059
it would tend to stay in the unlock
position this lock position the battery

483
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:31,909
dies it is to stay in the locked
position

484
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:35,260
and that was one of the things that
between the electronics guy and the the

485
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,279
cab

486
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:39,649
age argues be a back and forth like how
do we do this make sure we

487
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:43,460
ill we have to have a cam so where are
we really sure Street the

488
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:50,399
an so that in if it wasn't just a a
direct line movement for everything

489
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,750
with the solenoid it's not powered most
them you can go ahead and push the ride

490
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,140
either direction

491
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,000
her time are thank you all for your time
there is the slideshow

492
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,640
roulette upstairs on
