1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
he feels the sets 12 has

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,819
it was it was it was beautiful a
masterfully also a lot really good stuff

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:09,220
he also had a lot of points that I wanna
hang on

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,130
today as well %uh the name this
presentation is how not to suck a pen

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:13,610
testing

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,310
others lot of presentations that you'll
see where people to strip on the pen

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,900
testing industry and trust me we're
gonna have a couple slides

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,720
that boy wanna try and establish some
type of mental framework whenever you go

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,980
into a pen test

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,279
to establish what it is you're going to
do how you're going to have more

11
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:29,380
importantly why

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,120
we are doing what we are doing see the
first thing on across as I believe that

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,750
we have

14
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,790
a major issue in information security
whenever it comes to the area network

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,149
penetration test

16
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:44,579
and let me explain why I would most if
you do more ability assessment scanning

17
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,289
today what is the main requirement the
drive eeee assessments can occur most

18
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:49,770
reliable

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,039
sons PCI right

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,629
how those reports warrior whenever you
get set up in you do a PCI scan what do

21
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:00,510
you have to do in the executive

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,510
report you have the list

23
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,900
every single finding in the executive

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,460
reports we went for PC IASB scanning

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,860
a certification our executive report was

26
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,280
550 pages long the reason why bring that
up

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,770
is because we allow that to happen the
idea what a vulnerability assessment was

28
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,140
was boiled down to running a
vulnerability assessments school

29
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,780
checking out the report and giving that
as the findings just what that's not the

30
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,340
standard

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,409
most organizations that I know today
when are they due PCI ASP scanning the

32
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:40,759
run the ASP scam

33
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,070
they get the report and then they
probably throw the damn thing way

34
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,329
you know what that's probably the best
move that could possibly do the only

35
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,290
thing that does

36
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,770
establish some little due diligence so
some ASP scanner some security team can

37
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,630
say hey we told you guys about the

38
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,700
vulnerabilities it was in that report
that was a thousand pages long

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,310
sought my ass is cover from the scanning
specter I am terrified that was

40
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,210
ultimately going to happen in the area
network penetration testing

41
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,000
is gonna be reduced down to some kind of
simple concept some simple

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,420
simple methodology can be automated and
then at that point the Wolves will come

43
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,950
in and say you know what we can make it
to a little do this automated we will

44
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,000
stop us a standard

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,690
what a network penetration test should
be and as soon as that happens every

46
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,290
single

47
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,260
Council creativity that all these
beautiful crazy people do like prison

48
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,870
went before me this presentation

49
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,500
they no longer get to do that that's
where we are headed

50
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,739
right now if we allow that to happen

51
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:41,920
it's going to be in our future and also
in this industry is going to suck

52
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,900
a law never have another set as another
set of issues that we have

53
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,640
your but I don't read too much on
scanning because I think stan is a

54
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,530
beautiful thing

55
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,709
has a lot of talk about what type
affordability assessment scanner you

56
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,030
should or should not use a lot of
vendors fight may argue over it but

57
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,269
almost any penetration tester I know
worth their salt

58
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,930
they don't look at the scanners an
end-all be-all what should

59
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,159
be done and the vulnerabilities that are
important to address

60
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,620
on the target systems instead we look at
it as our eyes and our years

61
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,409
I mean honestly was the original
definition of a hocker

62
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,989
if we go back twenty thirty years ago
was the original definition of a hacker

63
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:23,870
was assumedly simply somebody was
maliciously trying to break into

64
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,879
computers just systems was something
different

65
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,489
was will

66
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,360
no I actually love the original hackers
were people to try to make things

67
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,519
actually work

68
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,569
and how did you actually make things
work back in the day

69
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:40,920
you had to know how they work right

70
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,159
you had to take them apart you had
understand them

71
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,549
and that's what a network penetration
test should be

72
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,319
and vulnerability assessments can is
outstanding

73
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,540
her taking that first step and trying to
learn as much as we possibly can about

74
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,640
systems that we are being hired

75
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,700
to break-ins whether or not your
consultant or they're not you're doing

76
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,890
it internally as part of your own
security

77
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,890
unfortunately whatever many people look
at former Billy assessment scans

78
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:12,349
what do they do what is the first thing
you do if I gave you an SS can or an

79
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:13,200
Expos cap

80
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,359
what's the first thing you look for in
that report critical so what color other

81
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,280
day

82
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,699
red so we're going to look for red

83
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:28,290
unfortunately today the methodology of
simply running a vulnerability

84
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,930
assessment scanning engine

85
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,120
looking for the Red and then using
Metasploit try and find those

86
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,080
vulnerabilities and then

87
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,040
exploit those gonna lose is a least five
years out of date

88
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,630
it just doesn't work that way anymore we
run into this all the time we work with

89
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,550
customers

90
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,080
and they have pens has done by other
companies was gonna call them a generic

91
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,919
blanket term

92
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:52,220
contest puppy mills I believe that was
just go to talk about that in his

93
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,009
presentation today and actually it's
kinda continuation

94
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,009
his presentation but we have these pen
test puppy mills

95
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:01,699
that they run the scanner take the
report the converted into a Word

96
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:02,300
document

97
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,080
and they submit its to you whenever in
teaching for the census to this one the

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,639
most common questions I get

99
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,020
they come up to me they say I really
need its cool that'll take Nessus

100
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,680
results and all converted into a Word
document format

101
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,570
June over tool that does that Mike no
you shouldn't do that like but my boss

102
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,520
requires

103
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,270
CIO requires they want to be converted
into that particular format you want it

104
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,330
sorted

105
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,020
and it has to have our logo on it as
well that's a little too looking for

106
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,180
and they're not actually using that more
police essence cannot taking those

107
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,810
results

108
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,460
and using it to try to understand

109
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,600
their target networks years ago I am
data capture the flag years before we

110
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,030
actually got support will not worse
going

111
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,650
and I had a challenge in the capsule
like it was a web server

112
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,160
and on this web servers just a simple
website not have a login user ID and

113
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,410
password

114
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,919
in the students but come into this
capture the flag in the fire up Burke

115
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,610
I'm they would fire outside attack proxy
and they would attack it may try to find

116
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,479
all abilities may try to find cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities

117
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,650
they would run nasa's they will run Accu
not actually run all these

118
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,870
awesome tools against this particular
website

119
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,729
and they wouldn't get in money at the
end of the night when no one would ever

120
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:18,000
get that particular

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,430
sleigh capsule play challenge people
come up to me and it's a

122
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,319
how do you how do you get that played on
that web server Mike did you open a

123
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,190
browser and go to the web server

124
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,870
will no you open a browser once the web
server said

125
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:35,380
user ID admin password whatever the
password was at the top

126
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,949
we relied on the tools because at the
tools and come back with the red

127
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,970
vulnerability in the clearly there was
no way that we are ever

128
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,380
ever going to break into this computer
system see

129
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,580
what's happening or allow that to occur
is were taking the human out of the mix

130
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,830
were taking the intelligence are the mix

131
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,449
and it's being reduced down to an
automated cross have said this many many

132
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,530
many times

133
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,729
if you can be replaced by an automated
tool

134
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:04,380
you will be so that's why I feel really
really deeply in my heart

135
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,539
anytime on any the mailing lists and
people you know the talk about what a

136
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:09,840
pen to should be and I put in my two
cents

137
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,889
and the come back to me they say my job
is converting Nessus

138
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,580
cans into Word documents and that's by
jewel do every single day

139
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,090
and it over the summer you in this room
you're not doing it because it's what

140
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,300
you want to do

141
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,639
you're doing it because you have one day
to an external network assessment per

142
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,210
thousand IP addresses

143
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,250
and somehow you got to get a report and
you gotta provided your boss

144
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,870
rates how quality your work is based on
how many pages were able to convert from

145
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,520
your nasa stencils

146
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,380
I feel for every single one of you I
really do

147
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,960
I could pick you a lot like stray
puppies hire you I would

148
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,419
your but I already have enough straight
poppies

149
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,180
cool sick cycle litter but

150
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,229
so we gotta try and move past this
looking for red

151
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:55,250
as the first thing I'm going to talk
about tonight so the solution is

152
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,819
the surf looking at the other planes

153
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,030
many up the people on the joint like
hill's information security

154
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,919
I I allowed them to make the state's and
it's a bit

155
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,569
strange I know it's probably a bit hard
but I understand what the stakes many

156
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:11,280
people

157
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,530
that are new to network penetration
testing are going to me

158
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,759
the first mistake that we see is the run
in SS can there's no reds and they say

159
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,530
well there's nothing here that we can
possibly break-ins

160
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,569
nothing at all another mistake as you
get access to a workstation say I gotta

161
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:27,680
love it to root gotta love it to
administrators system

162
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,520
and they spend three days doing that
gentleman what before me such as poland

163
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,669
see what you can get with you

164
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:37,919
level access you have thats awesome miss
ultimately once again going back to cure

165
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,969
definition of what a hacker's you're
using these schools

166
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,589
learn about the environment such a
breaking into

167
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,830
so use reportedly assessments cancer
halls if that's the type ancestor joins

168
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,610
a number of different types a pen test

169
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,570
that you can do but you're doing the
standard vulnerability assessment and

170
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,899
then trying to exploit computer systems

171
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:58,830
that's thats also make your gonna do
that but if your gonna use that

172
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,500
approached

173
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,100
those your eyes two ears two sensory
input you got almost

174
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,930
loves the organizations that are trying
to break into because you want to learn

175
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,180
as much as you possibly

176
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,640
and about them so a number of years ago

177
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,269
he said Roberts use buckles information
security was doing a pen test for a

178
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:15,320
customer of ours

179
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,529
that had multiple pen test from contest
puppy mills

180
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,580
they're being penned just about every
single core

181
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,240
and the pen test puppy mills to the same
thing they ran the scan the princess

182
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,100
report the head to the report and

183
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,980
and they said you know what you guys are
great there's no critical czars nor Reds

184
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,160
completely ignore all the mediums
Lausanne informational

185
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,029
because who cares about those so even
started going through the findings

186
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,500
and I he saw something that caught his
attention it was robocop riding a

187
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,220
unicorn

188
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,360
no was but

189
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,279
he saw he saw a website with the name
hello dot PHP

190
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,390
now its name is not an evil back to your
name at all

191
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,880
there's just innocuous a call to load up
PHP not what the heck I wanna know

192
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,089
would hold up PHP is so we searched
through

193
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,890
and he saw this I'm gonna give you guys
a couple steps number one

194
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,529
if you're on a pen test you go to a
website and there's a Skoal and

195
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,290
crossbones in the upper left hand corner

196
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,050
it's generally a bad sign

197
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,870
tip number two if you're doing a pen
test in like 2013 2014

198
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,560
and the school across ponds right next
to it has 2009

199
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,209
thats also a bad side

200
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,820
what this was is a PHP backdoor as you
guys know how many pens esters your love

201
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,610
WordPress

202
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,029
who to see the guys that are on smoking
pot going you know we need

203
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:43,250
we're in a way that people can upload
cropped or our servers without

204
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,890
authenticating to make that happen

205
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,519
and in for years Penn testers rejoice at
this capability

206
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,760
well somebody it uploaded a back door to
the server and have been compromised

207
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,279
for years for years

208
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,269
it was hard because we don't want to the
customer we said hey we found this

209
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:01,450
critical back door and what are your
servers

210
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,230
he said will wasn't red or purple on the
record

211
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,500
switch been trained to look more right
like Pavlov's dog

212
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,810
hot Cyprus take up we need to pass that
because

213
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,149
this is wrong this is the type of stuff
that people are paying you to do this at

214
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:21,170
work whether or not your next show
console

215
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,339
or you're doing internally for
organizations there in fact

216
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,640
paying you to do K that's that's just
your needs get to

217
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,930
another while I'll couple nights ago are
actually not a couple

218
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,670
couple months ago time lies oh we were
doing at work and test this is a company

219
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,760
that we had tested quite regularly

220
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,040
and I'll we really religious kinda
slogging through these

221
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,260
informational 0 warnings and there's
just thousands up from

222
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,269
and one of my favorites is directory
indexing is

223
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,589
is a gold mine I do yourself a big favor

224
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,829
it you can go into your neck spose your
Nessus us

225
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:00,360
configuration any finding that has share

226
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,130
indexable directory anything like that
cranked up hockey up high

227
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,100
so every time it shows up is bright red
critical when you look at

228
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,200
this was was a a customer

229
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,940
thats I'll at they had a lot of

230
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,519
I guess other customers and they sent
out a lot of email me hop

231
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,800
those customers you think MailChimp but
not that

232
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,839
okay no anytime there's an error

233
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,860
the application would actually dropped a
log file into the temp directory

234
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,540
and log file with name out all the
customer data the user ID is their

235
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,500
passwords

236
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,730
all the good stuff that you would
ultimately look for in a penthouse

237
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,329
and it was their application was
generating errol's

238
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:45,870
if you're in a in the pen testing feel
error logs are your best friend

239
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,730
especially for custom applications

240
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,070
because they believe all kinds of
horrible things as you can see we have

241
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,740
hundreds

242
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,860
the CSV files that we get to a certain
size and the rollover within a certain

243
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,690
time period

244
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,550
and it was just riddles with personally
identifiable information user ID's and

245
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,550
passwords for all their customers

246
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,649
years no luck so those major breaches
that have happened over the past couple

247
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:07,410
months

248
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,540
this would've been public this would
have been one of those massive breaches

249
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,279
that would've showed up on the front
page USA Today

250
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,050
was not read this is not purple there
was no lead hacking

251
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,029
there was no 0 involved in this it was
just an issue up treating your scan

252
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:22,730
results treating your data

253
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,220
as your eyes try to learn as much as you
possibly can about a network

254
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,260
another thing that we like to play with
sometimes you don't really have anything

255
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,389
says all there's an SMTP server about

256
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:36,019
are I love like informational and
warnings

257
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:39,540
that we thought an SMTP server or
another one of my favorites as we found

258
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,990
a telnet server

259
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,139
now would you will totally do you find
it on that server open on me

260
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:47,709
outside the Internet are you gonna go to
write take the banner

261
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,430
them to look up what type devices try
the default user ID's and passwords

262
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,480
nine times out of ten you're going to
get in with us

263
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,139
but this is me on this is one it was
done by Brian

264
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,470
done up to connect into the SMTP server
and if you try it to

265
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,279
send email to email outside the SMTP
server

266
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,380
it would pop up in tehran says sorry
that two main isn't in my list

267
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,910
allowed recipient hosts however he
discovered

268
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,760
that if you send to email looking
directly into the SMTP server

269
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,600
to an internal email address from an
internal email address

270
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,380
its sale that's fine you can probably do
that no problems whatsoever completely

271
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,029
bypassing all spam filters completely
bypassing any other filters now

272
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:32,260
why would this be configured this way

273
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,529
well this isn't easy configuration
change to make it not do this

274
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,750
were people scanning for what's the
biggest worry you would have a finance

275
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,769
SMTP server exposed on the opener

276
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:44,850
relay right this wasn't a relay server
because

277
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,120
I couldn't send emails I couldn't send
emails

278
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,649
outside of that organization but you CAN
SPAM inside the organization

279
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:56,100
all day law absolutely no problems

280
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,990
whatsoever so a couple years ago we had
something very very similar

281
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,889
we can access the internal SMTP server
from a compromise workstation

282
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:08,320
and I could shoot email to anybody from
the organization from

283
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,630
anywhere I want it to be so I shot a
emails I was touched sale we are going

284
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,190
bankrupt

285
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,389
everything must go from Abraham Lincoln
the president at White House stock up

286
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,639
in it said theater sucks and I remember

287
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,500
the customer getting really really
frustrated with me and saying well

288
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:31,500
that's just in poor taste like I said to
the customer to suit

289
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,980
this also requires us as network
penetration testers

290
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,060
to go beyond the scanning results

291
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,699
go beyond its getting results or
somebody earlier today I don't know who

292
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:45,160
did it was demonstrating

293
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,570
how you can harvest anybody's social
security number what I don't know

294
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,380
presentation that was but that's awesome
you think the bad guys will use that

295
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,759
against you

296
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,970
absolutely thats outside the bounds with
normal pen testing is done

297
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,660
there are more abilities just scan on
the cheap just to you that your ability

298
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,920
assessments can result so we have to go
beyond the scanning missiles

299
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,029
everything is not gonna communist and
Excel spreadsheet

300
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:12,139
that she needs a your know kinda offset1

301
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,050
arm was antivirus I'll we

302
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,740
I know that this is lead all a couple
weeks ago we did a webcast called secret

303
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,190
cash cow tipping

304
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,290
on by passing a the engines and we
bypassed all the AB engines that are up

305
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,060
here

306
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,490
and and they don't that's a song like
that was an awesome also that you know

307
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,430
sure technical challenge was all that
difficult fact most the guys a shot and

308
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,889
email the night before and said hey did
you bypass amanecer como ser like

309
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:42,130
our crop I gotta sober up for a little
while to to bypass the Avia been

310
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,040
drinking wine with my wife for the past
two hours

311
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,459
but it shouldn't be that big a deal and
we were able to bypass all the

312
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:49,380
relatively easy

313
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,790
there wasn't much difficulty in bypasses
now why does this matter how does its

314
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,630
highest this

315
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:59,509
presentation hi I see this a lot of
presentations

316
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:02,630
computer security is like architecture
and

317
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,160
structural engineering and I want to
explain exactly what that means

318
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,539
okay all my wife is a structural
engineer and

319
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:13,919
I like to read her books and everything
in structural engineering I've noticed

320
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,740
is all about failure and she gets really
uncomfortable when I bring that up

321
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,059
everything in her books is about failure
what is the failure point for rabin

322
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:23,929
spanning

323
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:27,750
this side of the room to the other side
there was a failure point four column in

324
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,130
the corner building was a pillar point
even like her doors

325
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,250
if there's some type of failure how much
we can do worse hold before they

326
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,490
collapse

327
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,950
that structural engineering and think
about what that's based upon

328
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:44,100
that's based upon thousands years a
jackass is breaking pacts

329
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,950
or we are those jackasses

330
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,440
that is our call we're the people that
are finding

331
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,490
the flaws Inc Hornets the different
components that make up

332
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,549
are architectures today we're the ones
that are going through and

333
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:03,370
finding those failure points and the
reason why this is important

334
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,929
is because we need to demonstrate to
management that yes semantic be bypassed

335
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:09,179
just back if you can

336
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,850
can be bypassed in fact all with them
can be bypassed this

337
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,220
is a structural weakness for AV

338
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,610
it's not about finding the right AntiVir
solution it's about mitigating

339
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,539
that structural weakness there's not a
single component in this building

340
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,580
that is completely impervious to any
type afloat you would put

341
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,230
everything sales at certain points and
your pen testing we're finding those

342
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,150
failure points

343
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,059
in those components and then we need to
share that with our customers we need to

344
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:40,110
share that with the other people with in
our organization

345
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,710
so that they better understand the
limitations the materials are working

346
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,020
with

347
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,090
in the IT infrastructure so that's why
we do this

348
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,480
it's more in line to show people what is
possible

349
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,809
and then try to move them to a better
place to start thinking

350
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:58,820
about how they're going to mitigate is
over all abilities

351
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,640
and we have the slides and we have the
presentations are we couldn't do all the

352
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,460
AB engines in 1 presentation

353
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,440
so everybody on the team created a slide
deck and videos demonstrating

354
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,929
now the reason why we created separate
slide decks and separate videos

355
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:13,140
demonstrating bypass

356
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,490
live was because I really don't wanna
get sued

357
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,580
arm its it's not it's not something
that's really high

358
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,000
on my on my list of things to accomplish
I call it a mitnick

359
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,429
complex I i looked as his is comment
today I don't want to go back to prison

360
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:32,809
or get sued something that I want to do
we went through and we traded all these

361
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:36,120
videos so that somebody did come back
and say you didn't bypass already we can

362
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,559
actually prove it

363
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,440
now what else can we do well stepping
beyond

364
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,320
the organization are close to going back
kevin Mitnick and a pedi

365
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,929
Dave talked about jigsaw right and what
was jigsaw used for

366
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,289
harvesting contacts right harvesting
contacts and recall angie is a great

367
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:58,590
tool that might sometimes that is number
of modules

368
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,130
for harvesting contacts one of the
things that we like to do

369
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,770
is harvest the contacts from an
organization and then use services like

370
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,970
Call list haven't home up theirs and
Gretch alarm is another service

371
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,419
and then basically checking to see in
either if any those email addresses

372
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:16,000
associated with the target organization

373
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,179
have been compromised on third party
sites like I O nine crack itself lunch

374
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,390
spot in the sites for the attackers
close

375
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,250
all the user ID's and passwords that
their hearts so the question is how bad

376
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,059
can it be

377
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,850
you can actually be very very bad on
these are so many polled month ago

378
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:35,330
granddaughter organise a dot gov Disney
dot com is 10,000 northrup-grumman

379
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,280
6600 7 these are user ID's and passwords
that are floating around on the open

380
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,360
Internet

381
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,820
now is giving his presentation and I
used to do live demos

382
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,340
jockeys pointing out should never do
live demos doesn't matter how smart you

383
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,390
are the democrats are going to kill you

384
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,450
it was doing a live demo on actually
showed up other company and somebody

385
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,909
came up and said you know I'll that's
kinda gray area

386
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:59,760
that technically maybe a legal with
showing user ID's and passwords

387
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,860
organizations like pecan Circuit City
now I'll

388
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,710
her the pic

389
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,010
like this guy really hate Circuit City
he hacks them all the time in bed

390
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,820
spur ever but you can see we get we can
see the actual

391
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,460
email address associated circuit city
employees were now unfortunately all

392
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,159
terminated

393
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,250
on and we can also see their passports
as well

394
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,470
is many web sites or those user ID's and
passwords is your ness is an exposed and

395
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,640
can actually show you this for billing

396
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,480
number this requires go outside the
bounds start thinking beyond

397
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,429
what it is we're getting from just a
scanning results trying to go deeper

398
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:43,429
I also want to spend a few seconds and
talk a little bit about getting call

399
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,570
it was discussed earlier why getting
caught is important and i wanna kinda

400
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,890
helped establish a couple frameworks
examples

401
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,370
on this is something that we've been
doing it P H I asked for a long time

402
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,850
and we strive to get caught a lot of
times we treat more scientific we have

403
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,080
an actual cell stretchy

404
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,750
show the different types now with the
different types of activities that we

405
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,409
did

406
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:08,280
and the idea is to find that clipping
well where can they actually detect you

407
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,919
and then give them a gap analysis and
what they can do to gets the next level

408
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,760
so that they can

409
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,870
base start touching them or desktops I'm
really sick and higher

410
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,470
a pen test that are basically pens are
saying hey we hiked you we've got to me

411
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,440
not men and we're done

412
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,500
it's not a Pentax that's just you trying
to prove that you're awesome usually

413
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,250
comes across

414
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,220
jerk we don't want instead we want to do
something like this

415
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,289
and this is actually probably one of the
better organizations that we tested

416
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:36,429
and this is just a small section
stretchy you generate a whole bunch of

417
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:39,289
different types on our custom our ask
shellcode injected

418
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:42,610
injection coated now we're on our number
of different ways

419
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,610
trying to get it to the target
organization invisible record

420
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,240
did they detected yes or no fail or pops

421
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,720
so then whenever you go to the
organization you can see these are the

422
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,940
holes your overall security architecture
and these are the things you can do to

423
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,929
try to mitigate

424
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:00,150
his overalls and that's that's great

425
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,850
and and that its like kinda side effect
in bonuses this if you do screw up in

426
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,429
your checking

427
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:08,520
can get caught can be like that all
summer to put that the sole spreadsheet

428
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,549
you guys did good

429
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:12,919
like okay its hines like group I really
shouldn't have sent that

430
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,130
uncoated interpreter and the
organization also data loss prevention

431
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,080
and they said we're in the midst a vote
a webcast series called sacred cow

432
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,659
tipping

433
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,470
a cash cow tipping information secure
there's a lot of people

434
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,260
that there's a lot of different
technologies that are becoming secret

435
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,370
house right

436
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,940
we got AB is clearly a sacred cow even
though most people in your can bypass it

437
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,520
matter

438
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,230
moments most organizations continue to
pin their entire security hopes and

439
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,059
dreams

440
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,200
upon eighty catching things but it may
be doesn't catch that's great we can use

441
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,730
data loss prevention

442
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,980
his anybody ever been in a pen testing
GOP like completely shut them down

443
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,500
if so don't worry is your him

444
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,419
her data loss prevention as near as I
can tell us only useful for keeping

445
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:59,679
honest people honest and helping catch
people that make general States

446
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,890
her real attacker it never works how
would you know that

447
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,520
because you're listening to the product
marketing but materials are provided you

448
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,270
think this is the best stuff since
sliced bread when in fact it doesn't

449
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,150
work at all

450
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,150
test that's what we're here to do your
great things to break stuff that's what

451
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,960
we do

452
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,750
find the structural laws but every time
we move forward

453
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,669
things jet harder for us and we find
more vulnerabilities

454
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:29,870
miss is a good thing I'm you look at
group policy preference files

455
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,590
I mean how many have you gotten to me
now been over group policy preference

456
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,760
files the past 4-5 months

457
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,840
its awesome right tell me if you like
way this new shell holder ability this

458
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,409
this bash things is gonna be like my
meal ticket for the next couple years

459
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:45,929
we kinda get hung up on those things the
slowly we start improving

460
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,090
right slowly will start removing some
other structural vulnerabilities

461
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,390
I'm not joking with my customers and
saying the worst thing you can do for

462
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,020
information security today

463
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,400
is one active directory on its it's like
it's a superhighway a breaking into

464
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,390
organizations

465
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,779
we make the steps forward and then we
find more vocals

466
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,730
one other fun things about Michael's
information security is

467
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,900
we have a lot of customers that listen
to security weekly and they listen to

468
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,750
what we recommend

469
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,010
they wait so we get everything kinda
squirreled away from a recommendations

470
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,240
and then they cost like we we've done
everything that we learned your class

471
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,390
ends by before hocker techniques and

472
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,390
exports and it's in handling we did
everything on the show now you can come

473
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,020
in 10 set/sets were like let's just

474
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,909
great also this is this going to be on

475
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:34,000
so we ran into a couple situations were
organizations have implemented

476
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,470
internet whitelist right and i've even
sat on the stage in said we need to move

477
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,580
to Internet whitelisting and I still
think that that's the right thing that

478
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,740
we need to do

479
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,650
we need certain rulings were
whitelisting costs that mean it's 100

480
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,559
percent secure

481
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,600
no doesn't mean it's better than
traditional internet blacklisting

482
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,669
absolutely so we need to try to move
people that doesn't mean

483
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:57,520
that we're not going to have stumbles
along the way

484
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,690
so even found out and what his pen test
that if you want to Internet

485
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,370
whitelisting

486
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,950
and you did a Google search is a Google
lot try to go to Google would say how

487
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,510
you can't go to that website

488
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,370
what you can do as you can do is search
that includes the two main

489
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,799
up the organization you're trying to
break into or out I'll

490
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,409
in it would say that's perfectly cool
the reason why

491
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,039
is because a regular expression goes
through the URL and it looks per

492
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,890
whitelisted domains solicited the target
organizations hacked dot com

493
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,190
if you can do a Google search for hot
dot com

494
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,630
it sees hot stock common that URL and it
allows you to bypass

495
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,919
it allows you to go to Google so if you
have a back door you have the back door

496
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,900
communicate over HTTP

497
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,039
and all you need to do is put in a
variable the situation it was

498
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,659
law equals hot dot com target company
dot com

499
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:50,750
and allows you to bypass does this work
on different organizations like

500
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,390
Websense yes sports on what sense as
well

501
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,529
server organization and you have to get
out about organization all you need to

502
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,220
do is Jen up your back door

503
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,980
so has a URL has the up target URL the
organization

504
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,890
and its gonna let you through because
that is an authorized the main what's

505
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,750
really cue

506
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,690
is going to try to give this the vendors
and say look this is something you might

507
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,130
wanna

508
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,590
effects what usually happens with
vendors they say will

509
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:20,490
yeah that's the way regular expressions
are supposed to work

510
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,960
really that's a feature now it's not

511
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,450
but slowly he will get better now the
next to technology gonna talk about

512
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,380
I don't wanna rip on them on because
it's going to sound like I am

513
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,299
but I actually love both these
technologies quite a bit first one is

514
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:36,340
bit 9

515
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,409
I love it nine but is it a pain to
install absolutely

516
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:44,370
but we do not work and testing and we
have to bypass but nine

517
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,500
now bypassing at nine for most ways to
bypass it isn't actually trying to

518
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,570
bypass bit 9

519
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,929
itself which really trying to do is find
configuration weaknesses

520
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:58,360
how the actual reconfigured and usually
the way that this is done

521
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,039
is trying to find a file type that is
authorized in that organization

522
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,399
trying to find a file type

523
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,700
I'm not gonna look at it no

524
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,399
but you'll do didn't ship so I gotta do
this

525
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:16,490
the whole presentation all the way
through so you got it right

526
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:23,490
she think that will help us Sabal palm
micro here

527
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,950
he likes it's okay

528
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,269
it it's warm yes you wanna smell

529
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:35,960
last year Trent was actually shoving a
minute but crop

530
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,700
and then turning around and showing
people what the spot word

531
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,840
I'll car actually in that case

532
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,649
take it so as I didn't look at it

533
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:49,899
no direct eye contact was made with
Smirnoff Ice

534
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:54,309
or that can accommodate what you have
alright

535
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:58,889
you just want me to bring something
trans always trying to get it wrong

536
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:02,389
in dark rooms alone

537
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:06,269
great I got that all over my Mac now
sheesh

538
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:13,269
stranger up

539
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:23,239
the to pick something else next year

540
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,470
police seconds

541
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,080
alright so up whatever

542
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,039
I don't even know what the hell about
more alright so whatever favorite ways

543
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,379
for bypassing but nine is PowerShell
scripts

544
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:45,859
know why would PowerShell scripts be
allowed to bypass but not how many of

545
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:49,379
your organizations use PowerShell parlor
day-to-day activities

546
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:53,470
I so a lot of what we're doing is we're
trying to find those gray areas

547
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,639
where we can exploit those gray areas in
the efforts

548
00:29:56,639 --> 00:30:01,249
trying to blend in are mister macdonell
its gonna give a presentation a little

549
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:01,979
bit later on

550
00:30:01,979 --> 00:30:05,619
on power cap which is netcat well

551
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:11,239
comes back strong the her

552
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:15,059
which is a powershell implement
implementation up net cap

553
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:18,210
so all you need to do is put your mouth
where or how to download and you can

554
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,769
direct memory injection using powershell

555
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:24,919
no bypassed most implementations up that
night you can actually judicial code

556
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:26,729
signing certificates for your scripts

557
00:30:26,729 --> 00:30:29,649
you can do a lot of things try to
mitigate this the by and large most

558
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:34,109
organizations will allow all that PS one
pulse execute for the allow all

559
00:30:34,109 --> 00:30:38,139
jar files to execute why we need to
allow job

560
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:41,700
this is JR just stop which is just a a

561
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,009
very nice kind of implementation a VNC
in Java

562
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,669
and almost ever sing organization we've
tested will allow you to fire up a back

563
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:51,220
door using Jr dust-up

564
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,559
hasn't leaked packing is just trying to
find those gray areas that most

565
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,619
organizations

566
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:59,119
miss whenever they're trying to
establish a security architecture the

567
00:30:59,119 --> 00:30:59,839
other thing

568
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,109
his eyes are evil great attacks now the
reason why this works this because it's

569
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:04,710
something called

570
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:08,440
inherits whenever you have an
application that runs

571
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,889
many times you will say I trust this
application or I trust this directory

572
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:16,190
that this particular application
executes from in n

573
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,999
anything else that excuse in that
directory or anything else that is

574
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:21,369
executed from an execute a bill that is
already trusted

575
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:25,339
will be trusted as well so if you have
Java update

576
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:28,710
right job Updater is trusted because you
want to take your job

577
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,389
when Java updater goes out hold on
executed you can give them our using ISO

578
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:34,210
evil great

579
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,609
and then not now where will be trusted
because it was started

580
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:42,229
from Java update so you basically take
advantage of that issue of inheritance

581
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:45,970
in this problem or the more difficult
things organizations the tune that nine

582
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,629
it actually gets to work properly to
detect hollow also

583
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:54,259
and their application inspection I once
again I like this product think these

584
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:55,720
guys are great vendor that you

585
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,099
really cool thanks once again is the
product super easy to implement

586
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:02,279
no it takes a lotta love care and
feeding

587
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:06,710
try to implement it properly and
whatever favorite tools for bypassing

588
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,679
these products products like Palo Alto
is Ron poses DNS cap

589
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,519
how many guys were on does is talk today
GN hun

590
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,749
ron was there that's trucked although he
looked like he wasn't sure

591
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:23,859
I don't quite know why he looked a
little bit confused about that

592
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:28,460
um if you are working with the firewall
thunder and you want to get a discount

593
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,059
on that too on that product

594
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,339
for a bronze for run gives it away for
free

595
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:37,029
on the tool I mean um I mean

596
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:40,619
DNS cat DNS cat is the tool that Rondo's

597
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:44,029
gives away her three trying to be more
precise when I speak

598
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:48,519
but arm a genus cat is an outstanding
product and you can test it when a

599
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:50,799
beautiful shell bypassing someone's
product

600
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,559
also the price tends to come down a
little bit from a cost perspective

601
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,970
and you can hear vendors if you ask them
they're gonna say oh yeah we totally

602
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:01,099
catch that is dns uses port 53 you TP

603
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:04,440
and I we have we monitor not for no
that's not

604
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,099
how Dean ascap works it's not a shell
over TCP UTPA if that was the case

605
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:13,220
are runs for would be the lamest
whatever know it does more than that it

606
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,099
does all the back door communication

607
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:18,539
over well for me DNS requests and
responses

608
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,779
that's what makes it awesome makes a
very good

609
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,899
another thing you can do we have a tool
called vs agent that we've created

610
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:28,450
and all the all the communication with
the tool

611
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,450
goes back and forth and well-formed HTML

612
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,549
and we insert all over command control

613
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:39,379
in a value called underscore you states
anybody encounter underscored view state

614
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:40,929
and the weather application Kansas

615
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:44,009
how long can this field gets

616
00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:49,079
perfect we I think we had a record one
of our test for us personally

617
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:52,089
four pages long a view stated

618
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:55,889
I'll and into their customers like why
is it taking you so long to scan your

619
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:58,049
website might because it's broken

620
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:02,339
that's what but this makes an
outstanding feels for us to explore

621
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:05,009
their this makes an outstanding field
for command control

622
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,299
because it's meant to be randomized
right

623
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:12,569
it's meant to be longer variable length
but usually very very very wrong

624
00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:15,779
in most your firewall tools will not do
analysis

625
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:19,109
on those fields because it's impossible
for them to do analysis

626
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:22,119
on every single one of those skills so
that's the easy way

627
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:26,500
to try and bypassed so let's talk about
trying to find new areas and that's

628
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:26,918
kinda

629
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:30,970
we're going to start tying sup is we
need to find new areas as network and

630
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:34,059
testers and we need to continue pushing
things as network and testers

631
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:38,899
beyond just saying i hack a toaster we
find additional things that we can do is

632
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:42,279
part of a network security assessments
and network penetration test

633
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:45,579
keep pushing it never be able to
automate it will never be able to create

634
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:47,460
a standard says this is what it is

635
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,339
if we keep pushing the boundaries so one
of the things that

636
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:55,260
that hit me as kind of a weird strange
narrative

637
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,270
a whatever good friends works at a very
large bank and he sat down one day and

638
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,660
he said wait a minute

639
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,230
I wanna know if we had any banking back
doors are Trojans

640
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:10,950
that are not being actively detected by
our current and time our suites

641
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,069
that's kinda tall or right how would you
go about doing that

642
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:18,109
one of the things he noticed though
whenever he was reverse engineering

643
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:18,759
somebody's

644
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:23,779
really high and backdoor Trojans is they
hated zoos

645
00:35:23,779 --> 00:35:28,290
in times who's hit that box those back
towards it immediately kills its

646
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,619
why competitor

647
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:35,180
right take other competitor you want
that data

648
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,650
so he got an idea that i think is a bit
extreme I don't know if I'd recommend it

649
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,490
but he modified zoos so wouldn't spread
and then deployed its to every single

650
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,619
one of the systems

651
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:52,029
then he queried who is this installs

652
00:35:52,029 --> 00:35:55,359
everybody but those five systems go
investigate those five systems right

653
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,770
away

654
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,450
we've noticed many situations were Mauer
gets on a system in one the first things

655
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,230
it does

656
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,849
is it looks for other now earn a tries
to circumvented uninstall

657
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:10,180
and destroy as network Penn testers are
we supposed to be trying to emulate what

658
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,259
the bad guys do

659
00:36:12,259 --> 00:36:16,569
could we do that I know this is a bit
presumptuous

660
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:20,910
to say I think that network and testers
make up some creative ways of trying to

661
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,619
find now learning environments

662
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:26,130
because we create an hour I think
network and testers may find some

663
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,349
creative ways trying to take the tax

664
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:32,020
when internally with an environment
because that's what we do

665
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,359
so this area it's been around for a
while got a number for names we call

666
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,000
hunting on the name that the name hun
teaming

667
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,319
was coined by sup miser Nair conrad et
sans and they've done some tremendously

668
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:49,500
amazing call work in this arena actively
trying to find the bad guys not using AV

669
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,759
not trying to use are in the number I've
liked security suites but assuming

670
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:57,549
that the security tools have fail how
would you detected

671
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,950
now the reason why we started doing this
is because we had a pen test I think it

672
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,400
was our

673
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,329
early summer and the customer was
completely compromised and we're going

674
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:05,670
through

675
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,369
getting all animated about what we did
and customers getting

676
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:13,020
horrified about what we were saying and
that he and

677
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,460
they said well we must be horrible in
job goes no

678
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,670
you guys are one of the best customers
we've never been tested you guys were

679
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,099
fantastic

680
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:25,160
they about all over they were doing
everything right

681
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,349
and they're still getting compromise so
we're feeling pretty high and mighty in

682
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:29,049
and they said

683
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:32,440
we want you guys to come in and find
attackers that are using these types of

684
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,740
techniques on our

685
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,980
it works we found a whole bunch of
systems that were compromised a number

686
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,930
for customers and worked out really well

687
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,809
so I headed over to jock um he's gonna
go over a couple slides talking about

688
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:44,890
this is kinda preview webcast

689
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,619
that we have coming up on security
weekly on the subject to 20 min yes we

690
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:50,480
did color coordinates

691
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,890
up alright then become even looked up
gone so yeah

692
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,400
apparently at Black Hills we have a
dress code com

693
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,970
and I'm these guys to get members you're
at a uniform soldiers but

694
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:06,690
up so hot teaming I'm thanks John I'll

695
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,890
launch of II with Black Hills I

696
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,279
also cohost very weakly I'm because John
the whole good anymore not just him

697
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:19,190
I Ave near we have a good time but I'll
cut seeming so

698
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,130
as john was saying you know what what
we've put this model on its head you

699
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,460
know let's let's

700
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,960
find some techniques that we can locate
indicators compromise an environment and

701
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,020
I'm not just talking about

702
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,170
individual systems look at that
environment

703
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,109
network-wide look at all systems look at
the behaviors that the systems look at

704
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:37,809
what's going on in that environment

705
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:41,440
and look for normal versus abnormal SEP
can at them to buy

706
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,160
abnormal threes various techniques

707
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,239
site one example DNS desc2

708
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,160
right we got stock we can leverage to
look for

709
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,460
desc2 activity right we can go to our
customer insight hey guys

710
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,759
why did she give me your DNS cache

711
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:03,520
K watch dump that adhere to main
controls are at your by nine environment

712
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,200
where it is

713
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,440
on a look through it right why don't you
give me

714
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,430
loss of your DNS activity over a period
of time

715
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,290
we gonna scheme through that we gotta
look for interesting things right when

716
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,579
the first things I did like all the
script together

717
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:21,040
that just dance routine is cached answer
is yes logs

718
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,270
and just compare it with the the D
Schultz which is the main

719
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:28,569
HotList right let's go see if something
pops out you look up to

720
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:32,250
a known fat the main so let's like that
and in

721
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,920
look at that the thing is I had here's
the records have very short GTO

722
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,450
turns out that doesn't have as much
traction as I thought because when

723
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,579
you're looking at the NS cash

724
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:45,309
things do have short tttt else right the
countdown and so it's not quite as

725
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:46,250
effective but

726
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,390
you can sometimes find indicators up
like up

727
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:55,880
watching activity with with NS records
in particular in the short jail space

728
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,279
so what else can we do right week we can
look at host a mouse again we become

729
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:00,089
PowerShell

730
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:03,180
we soon that we have

731
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,020
a two main com admin access we just got
a customer say look ice

732
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,690
we just the German straight access
because we gotta run some scripts to

733
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,549
hunt around your environment actually

734
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:14,599
look for interesting facts right so

735
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,359
we grab that we've got all kinds of ways
we can remind WPS exactly MMIC we can

736
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,339
we cannot win our aim in some cases of
and we can run the scripts

737
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:27,040
on individual stations and pull back
data and look at that date

738
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,270
K so we're pullback world is this this
all sorts of things we wanna

739
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,079
wanna hold back right we can pull back
run keys run one ski

740
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,369
we could pull back installed software
list you know we can not we can pull

741
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:39,930
back

742
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,940
all kinds of interesting facts so we can

743
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,940
political such location we can analyze
and then where

744
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:49,900
you know we could find some really
interesting outfits right

745
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,739
I'll also in Houston now space

746
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:57,980
we do Aceh's transfer exact right let's
say we have a a

747
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,339
I'll a permit or firewall promoter

748
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:05,540
proxy right let's go through all those
aged BH screens what what

749
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,230
is reaching out what use rates stringing
setting

750
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,569
I let's take that lets thought that
let's

751
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:16,770
we will come inside stuff aside rightly
know what mozilla is you know I years

752
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:20,369
know what's larry is whatever it might
be time that so

753
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:24,529
upon us and elect hey we've got this
really lose frequency

754
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:29,029
HD the user agent strings that are
really weird

755
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:32,680
like at least nine at the supposed to be
in our environment

756
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,059
let up those damn with the coming from
what stations using that what why

757
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:39,790
is using that is to be a shoestring and
lets watched

758
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:44,400
chase it down list hunting a denim work
else go right

759
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,290
okay back to John there was by five
seconds

760
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,849
but like I said that's a preview we're
gonna have an entire hour on that job

761
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,069
have like 30 slides with all the
different scripts the PowerShell scripts

762
00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:57,279
one of her favorites is dumping
certificates for

763
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:00,420
code signing certificates from your
environment and doing an analysis on

764
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,309
those will have an hour webcast on that
coming up here in the next couple weeks

765
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:07,869
so and and the whole justin's entire
presentation is we need to keep moving

766
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:09,819
forward as network and testers

767
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,989
we need to continue to find new things
to do not just proving that we can break

768
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,430
into organizations but

769
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,259
actually trying to find the clipping
what levels with organizations can

770
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:17,960
detect us

771
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,309
we need to move forward and actually
start going through the viability

772
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:22,349
assessment findings look at the
informational

773
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:26,759
in the warnings lows to dig through to
find those risks that are missed

774
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:29,819
by just a tool that's looking for
something that's a higher critical

775
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:32,849
and the thing that's hardest for me to
say

776
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:35,910
because it comes across as a bit harsh
to other people

777
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:40,119
right now I believe firmly the people
that are in this room in the pen testing

778
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:42,290
kind of the offense a security community

779
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,989
or the pointy end to the state we are
spearheading

780
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:50,099
a lot of what happens in computer
security if you don't believe me

781
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:53,140
sit down and talk to anybody that does
friends it's a frenzy cater

782
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,369
as they like to be called from time to
time and ask them he would you know

783
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:57,910
about many cats

784
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:02,040
many times does look at you blankly and
have no idea we know about impersonating

785
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,059
tokens

786
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:06,040
hear a lot of people in France it's not
all but you're a lot I'm sable is that

787
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,420
even possible

788
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,670
as I said we are many times the pointy
end of the stick

789
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,380
and if we start slacking off and I see
indications are slacking off the rest of

790
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,549
the industry is going to follow

791
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:20,220
a lot to the cutting edge research is
being done or is being done by the

792
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:20,640
people

793
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,910
up these cons being done the people at
these presentations

794
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:27,880
and we need to continue to push that as
much as we possibly can

795
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,009
so this is bad for all of us if we allow
the things that are occurring

796
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:34,220
continue to occur and if you're at

797
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,020
a pen testing firm that is a pen test up
you know I said I feel sorry for you

798
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,700
and I don't mean that kinda derogatory
mean way I genuinely feel bad

799
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,319
because I come across a lot of people
that are just running message results

800
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:48,690
and turning it into report just turning
those things as quickly as they possibly

801
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:49,680
can

802
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,839
time to stand up and try to push back a
little bit

803
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,020
I know that that's hard I know that
that's difficult

804
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,619
and you're going to fail and as a say in
almost all my presentations you're going

805
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,339
to fail doing the right thing

806
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:05,059
I would rather fail doing the right
thing than live my entire life doing the

807
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,839
compliant

808
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,119
that's not something I wanna go to my
grave and say our I am i environments

809
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,329
for PCI

810
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:14,540
compliance that's not what we're here
for

811
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:17,700
that's not the way we want to go out
tonight and on my credit something

812
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,829
called the penetration testers khuda bux

813
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:24,390
if you can try to live by these could
have ethics and what you doing your job

814
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,470
at any time you try to big break and
anything

815
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:30,770
you're gonna be okay you're gonna be
fine first I will never copy and paste

816
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,739
automated results

817
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:36,829
ever I got an argument with Ron cool
about that

818
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:41,549
and a eating he was on he said you know
I don't think anybody should

819
00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:44,930
ever copy and paste anything from nasa's
because that's our that's our

820
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:48,509
that's our copyrighted work

821
00:44:48,509 --> 00:44:52,359
was like was he's kind of a jerk

822
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:56,220
and I got to thinking about it in as
time passed I realized he was right

823
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:01,730
not necessarily because its copyright or
legal issues because it sleazy

824
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:06,329
we should do that some people are paying
us to do also never completely trust

825
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,970
my scan results that's where you go to
the lows informational sites redefined

826
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:11,489
the beautiful things

827
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:14,549
that's we're gonna find vulnerabilities
schools miss

828
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:17,319
that's we're gonna find the water bill
is that every pen testing from the camps

829
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:18,690
for you missed

830
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:22,759
and that his boss that is a great
feeling when someone says we have hired

831
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:26,220
10 firms before you and you're the only
one to catch this

832
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,670
thats that's probably the best feeling
in the world in this industry

833
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:33,310
I will strive to get caught after being

834
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:37,480
awesome be stealthy be great at what you
do

835
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,140
takeover two mains do what you do but
then

836
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,469
strives to call there's a couple reasons
for his first reason is we can give them

837
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:48,400
a clipping level the second reason is

838
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,589
after you've destroyed their network
gives them a little tip for the hot and

839
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:54,540
say hey your security team is doing
really really good

840
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,369
they caught us doing these things but
here's some things they can do to make

841
00:45:57,369 --> 00:45:58,440
it better

842
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,040
if your approach penthouses adversarial
they sock we rock

843
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,549
you're not gonna be very good at this
really not is your best customers in the

844
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:08,799
future gonna be your current customers
in the more that they like you

845
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:12,449
the more you're going to be invited back
I'll go beyond the scan results I will

846
00:46:12,449 --> 00:46:15,339
continue to look at things outside of
the organization we talked about using

847
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,270
rekon and she in funding for bill is a
standard scanners

848
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:23,069
don't pick up I'll try to be a hockey in
the original sense of the word

849
00:46:23,069 --> 00:46:26,489
in and in most other people and counter

850
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:30,230
at these conferences are actually in
this well right for example

851
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:33,339
I thought it was pretty cool I got a
couple and I like hell

852
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:36,449
I think it's a great watch now
completely obsolete and Saturday

853
00:46:36,449 --> 00:46:39,849
in these guys up front can you guys hold
up your arms

854
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:44,170
show up with those things and I'm like
what the hell does not like they're not

855
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,310
launchers

856
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:50,219
I don't know what that means but it's
more badass than what I have here

857
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:54,589
but that's cool right you go deeper you
it isn't just about getting the t-shirts

858
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:57,190
it isn't just about getting the cool
packs that we have

859
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,569
is about getting the call patches the
stickers and looking look

860
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:03,859
remember being a hackers a way of life
you take things apart

861
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:07,299
constantly learning in most if you're
hearing this from because you have that

862
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:08,079
already

863
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,859
and we need to continue to have the
curiosity about every pen test we do as

864
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:14,930
I said you should fall in love with
every organization you try to break into

865
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,630
get to know them a little bit it should
just be a scan results go to their

866
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:19,239
website

867
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:22,440
I know that that's a novel idea for some
people then

868
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,900
go to their website see what's there see
with their businesses it's just kind of

869
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,750
a good idea

870
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,140
I will always stay in school this one's
actually much harder

871
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,420
than it looks this could be in a
presentation all in Assam

872
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,640
but I'll give you one example we were
pen testing a access email

873
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,980
and I gave us their author the Class C

874
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,190
and we started scanning the classy
started attacking the classy

875
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:47,480
we found in now server with the default
user ID and password

876
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,650
and we got in and was a casino those
completely different to the casino that

877
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,040
we're a pen testing

878
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,619
and we said he did you guys own net
casino and they're like

879
00:47:56,619 --> 00:48:00,109
no full

880
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:03,270
this is the easily i peaced ranges the
the

881
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,640
you gave us this Sat oh yeah our servers
are in that range we don't know what

882
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,810
they are we're hoping you could tell us

883
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:15,489
don't let that happen to you boys and
girls and then finally

884
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:19,460
my reports for rock I i think that
that's that's something that

885
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,710
that having everybody on the team hates
me for but I insist that our

886
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:27,250
we have a narrative for every single pen
test we did a sports bars what we did

887
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,420
why we did it was a successful or was it
a failure

888
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,380
a lot of a certain secure about the
things that we do that didn't work

889
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,109
your customers are paying you for that
it isn't just about buying a report that

890
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:40,599
says these are all the successful things
that we found in these all the

891
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:43,020
vulnerabilities and look how awesome I
am

892
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,549
if you struggled on something your
customer needs to know

893
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:50,079
that you struggled on something that's
good

894
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,190
the chosen that there's a reason they're
network that are fairly strong you

895
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,819
eventually overcome them hopefully

896
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:58,020
and then you can explain that to them
but they have to see that struggle

897
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:01,079
with at this is so important to make
sure that works appropriately

898
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,150
and on the last minute I wanna show you
really quick

899
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,230

we've got pitchers from xkcd so that's
right there

902
00:49:15,299 --> 00:49:19,060
we got actual scripts for dumping outs

903

905
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,540
the different components for looking at
work station variance

906
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,839
going through employing doubt I'll that
computer objects

907
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:36,869
going through and pulling up run once
one was executed he's installed software

908
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:40,540
looking at the certificate stores it's
just a lot of cool stuff so please check

909
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:43,449

and you would like a copy a get on the
list for the webcast we're coming up

911
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:51,230
swing by the security weekly booze bring
me a business card her rights

sell it to the vendors

913
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:59,930
in on behalf of all who say thank you no
no

914
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:04,250
we we never would do that ever on that's
not that's not an urgent

915
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:09,890
so any questions our last few moments
before we draw down to get outta here

916
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:16,890
yes

917
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:34,040
up

918
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,410
so there's a number of different things
to cover their you talked about what if

919
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,410
we don't lock Aldi lol so we don't white
list all the allows and what if we don't

920
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,299
restrict certain

921
00:50:43,299 --> 00:50:46,359
run Frankie's like when he run once run
once execute

922
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:49,579
the two different issues ones
persistence and actually they're both

923
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,150
assistance

924
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,969
has a lot of the bad guys were the creep
back doors they actually inject

925
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:56,239
themselves into existing dynamic link
libraries and then they persist through

926
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:57,049
that mechanism

927
00:50:57,049 --> 00:51:00,650
in many many many situations but the
issue is what is being written

928
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:04,150
to that director with the deals are
being executed a lot of application

929
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,880
whitelisting implementations they just
basically start baby steps

930
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,319
we'll start with directories things are
allowed to execute

931
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:14,730
from and then a slow start going through
trying to wait lists all the dynamic

932
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,410
link libraries from that point on

933
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:20,099
arm so you gotta start at that level
slowly work your work your way up

934
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:23,199
the idea of trying to whitelist all
those great it's gonna take time to

935
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:25,690
implement and there's baby steps that
you can take for that

936
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,390
some

937
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:33,089
you just run that one dll that are you
white listing the jar files that are

938
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:34,359
being executed as well

939
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:37,670
person just blanket specific ones and
that's great

940
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,290
most organizations what they do is they
do like star dot jar

941
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:47,250
that's fat from looked it up

942
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,489
cool and that would be though if you
prefer remember there are a lot more

943
00:51:50,489 --> 00:51:53,920
are starting to appoint someone doesn't
just upset that make sure those are some

944
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,839
as well alright thats it thank you very
much everybody I greatly appreciate it

945
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,460
and thanks to job for coming up and
doing a preview for us
