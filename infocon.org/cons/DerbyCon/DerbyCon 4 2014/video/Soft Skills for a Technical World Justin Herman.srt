1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,310
I took some my name is Justin Herman

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,509
and this is soft skills for technical
world or

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,990
30 minutes up overall doing wrong um

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,670
thank you for all common and like I said
I'm Miami is

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,539
Justin I'm a Senior Systems
Administrator in health care industry

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,640
and I Laval major love of learning

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,670
I love those things is personality
traits

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,310
and I like learning about different
learning patterns

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,410
people take final their source

10
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,200
upon knowledge what is really gonna
cover is our

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,329
on the stereotypes that we have in our
industry

12
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:43,500
and maybe how we can deconstruct those
in

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,879
25 minutes to maybe get to a written
record how we can

14
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,960
solve some of the problems that we have

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,260
up not so much internally but time or
externally

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,350
from our group how we can become more
inclusive elects

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,710
exclusive for the rest a bomb well the
world how they perceive us

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,829
and kinda getting to what we want to
have a bit

19
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:07,549
solana stereotypes that you might see is

20
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,229
like this guy on SNL skit now larry the
IT guy

21
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:14,460
we say I work in IT you know they ask
you

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,470
can you fix my computer and can you

23
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,520
do this and he solve these problems what
can I get from directly from you

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,680
and what they're really trying to
achieve is that they're trying to open

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,680
and source some information from you but
so often

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,250
whoever kills we shut down cold we don't
want to answer questions we don't want

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:34,700
to help

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,700
because we get drawn into this cycle up

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,259
Ni Ni Ni what I want what they but they
Stickley one person was asking questions

30
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,439
instead of creating a a give-and-take

31
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,299
a um positive type love communication

32
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,380
and and feeling happens from there so
some other cell types that we also

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,930
as an industry Carey on rear are void
people or antisocial

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,770
we don't want to discussed things that
are outside of our

35
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,340
group we don't really like I'll breaking
out of our shells

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,429
that's one of the reasons why you see
hack on Sky not so well

37
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,590
is that people are able to feel like
they can

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,150
share and be comfortable making you like
people on people that understand them

39
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,760
but outlet real-world ministry don't
have a conference

40
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,080
for people who I'm working Mickey D's
you don't have a conference for people

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,959
who are

42
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,690
um do regular other type tasks like they
may have specific

43
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,260
industry tasks like if your account you
might go to enact the count

44
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,160
convention but getting beyond those
points we need to find a way to

45
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,980
a reduce those barriers down that we can
feel comfortable

46
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,930
with our personalities and we can be
able to communicate with others

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,300
that in a group um from the start up so
we have arguably maybe

48
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,090
grumpy and unmotivated although they
don't leave

49
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,500
he's a true but is some the stereotypes
other were loners

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,010
that were social I'll castrate were very
nerdy

51
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,220
that run cable and we have something
really big culture shift that's been

52
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,310
occurring or so the

53
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,150
nerdy aspect that's big I mean more but
'em

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,760
prevalent and more acceptable in our
industry in in the in the world in order

55
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,560
to being nerdy school

56
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,190
but it still can be scanned saturday on
a negative an attachment and it's

57
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,810
something that

58
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,159
you don't need to be different you just
need to be able to communicate that

59
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,049
personalities little daughter different
I'm spero di

60
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,980
impossible to reason with and the last
one which

61
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,000
is kinda shown by the picture but just
stock app from SNL

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,599
is the ungroomed or unkempt um

63
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,400
the fact that you know he's look at him
he is beard is

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,810
poorly on their that his shirt doesn't
fit

65
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,349
that his hair is messy um you know these
are all aspects that you know you have

66
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,299
pride in yourself enough pride in

67
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:01,860
how you present yourself into the rest
the world and dress the world

68
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,769
it seems it as being that you just don't
care um

69
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,830
quote that iraq's was found in a
student's misinformation was

70
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,269
I'll come interesting I and that is %uh
people in fermentation technology

71
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,540
seen tend to lack certain skills and
then

72
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,570
is empathy and social abilities and I
thought was really strong

73
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,759
is person I don't think that I have
stood many issues with that but

74
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,100
I do know that at times I can I'll

75
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,220
not want to join into groups and in
conversation and I wanted to learn more

76
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,440
about that I thought about

77
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,560
other types be able to find my friends
are in our industry

78
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,440
and it goes on to say that folks and
information technicians are famous and

79
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,389
shit for not getting along with people

80
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,050
and other parts other companies and
that's I was from an unnamed

81
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,050
touchy datasource systems executive any
really came to me is an idea that

82
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,100
why is it that we don't have empathy
remain the pits perceive that we don't

83
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,509
have empathy we don't have social skills

84
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,660
and to break that down as small the
court things I wanna try to do today

85
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,970
so when I was thinking about it I
remember many other types have

86
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,789
identification czar identities that get
performed when you're in um

87
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:14,660
high school or middle school list what
career path you might be

88
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,190
good and then most times people are
pretty bored with that may find

89
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,190
pretty intellectually I'm non simulating
Saito

90
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,759
pay too much attention to it by went
back and I I am

91
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,539
looked it over I'll in markets all my
friends here are

92
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,680
brought brought the idea back to me and
that was actually I'm Myers Briggs

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,199
type int indicator if you've never had a
chance to do one of these test it's

94
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,310
about 20 questions

95
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,490
and I'm saying it s action not correct

96
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,570
it's Morgan identification identity I am

97
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,470
indicator they call it and if you go to
this particular site me type it in for

98
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,080
about 20 questions they

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,229
seeking help correspondent type a
personality that you might be

100
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,360
and some helps give insight to the
typeof actions and workplace that you

101
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,600
might want to interact with

102
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,090
and and Mike course this is our one on
the steps I thought would be helpful

103
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,190
um and try to understand where I kind of
it in

104
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,650
and so I took it and some it said when
my career choices

105
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,610
was in computers in science and um also
in and girl ship

106
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,699
and I'll I look more in it said the ENTP
certainly have the following traits:

107
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:22,569
some

108
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:27,009
generate ideas and theories arm bright
and capable and

109
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:30,710
flexible in the verse in Ali's positive
things able to grasp its will suck

110
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,990
concepts and theories and enjoying
softened difficult problems and I'm sure

111
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,830
a lot of guys feel the same way delay I

112
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,620
I feel the same thing c-arm I had girls
let's do this

113
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,240
and then you look at the the next step
and um

114
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,380
this is from the negatives I that I saw
from it and this is a the week

115
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,190
resist being controlled by people and
I'm sure all of us can agree that we

116
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,860
don't like being controlled and nobody
nobody likes being oppressed but

117
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,819
some people do like to have clear
directions to be set down and saying

118
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,360
a task to be achieve them delivered and
in response

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,800
that they're gonna be positively set um
dislike

120
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,470
can combining schedules environments and
I i

121
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,120
my wife is here and she tell you that's
one of my things I I'm

122
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,509
love playing by the same app and select
to be just ready let's

123
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:21,500
let's go and do something um you don't
be combined into one half

124
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,130
a set schedule service wanna let's have
some fun and figure something out

125
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,470
and then dislike tasks that are the feel
like our the waste of time

126
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,530
um and I know that nobody I wouldn't get
a nobody enjoys doing things they find

127
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,830
ways to time but

128
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,979
we find more issues with that nose and
ENTP personality and like I said I

129
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,180
encourage everybody to

130
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,039
find more time I tried I'll diesel
Mercedes on this and get schedules and

131
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,550
um survey more are are members of our
group in Figure

132
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,460
what is the propensity of the steps so
far personality traits but

133
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,970
I encourage it like said check this out
my Google Inc but

134
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,770
quick when I found the celebrity types
dot com forward slash test

135
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,949
who in the PHP

136
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,750
um so the real problems that I thought
we had was we had a lack of

137
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,080
communication skills

138
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,560
and a lackey connections other ice
outside of our circles may be very tight

139
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,830
with people that are inner circles that
me

140
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,780
we may feel safe West but branching out
beyond that we might have a little bit

141
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,599
issues

142
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:31,319
and how we can try to solve those with I
thought coming back to the quote

143
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,940
and um summit personnel it raises some
other communication skills needed

144
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,149
really amp those up arm you know we have
a lot to technical

145
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,719
rebel to pick up on a lot of time with
the beef is a goal or

146
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,399
or virtual I'm talking about
intellectual concepts that have never

147
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:47,810
been

148
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,580
religious custom made or fine way over
their head but where to pick those up

149
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,200
really easily

150
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,959
but when we comes to just interacting
with people

151
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,480
I outside of work groups and outside her
comfort areas

152
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,910
both visually and auditory early and are

153
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,510
in many many methods of communication
were just which is kinda lacking so what

154
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,860
a concept there somebody

155
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,600
he weighs a communications me we can
figure out I'll what might work

156
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,990
lol %uh so verbal communication

157
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,720
I is all aspects how you might express
your positions your thoughts your voice

158
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,080
and doesn't want to this republic unlike
you I doubt that makes a lot of sense

159
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,580
but

160
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,080
if you think about every action that you
make and how those are positive negative

161
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,940
affected

162
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,649
you'll start seeing that there's things
that we can all do to improve this

163
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,149
even as I write these all down I'm
recognize that there's some things I'm

164
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,709
I'm week on um so

165
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:44,330
verbal communication you got these are
kinda things that you express

166
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,430
out using your voice in you got sounds
you got language tones a voice

167
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,519
arm in so in anything that you kind of

168
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,740
express it to other people in a in a
verbal expressive manner that you're

169
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,610
intending to send out

170
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,209
so um fighting have not happy

171
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:06,300
some you know I had a long day or
something I might be speaking lower in

172
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,480
tone of voice our might be

173
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,680
by inflection might be much higher
because I'm excited and I'm

174
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,140
just popped up box I'm doing great ideas
also some

175
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:20,200
um and personal type of language to use
whatever the asians are slang

176
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,930
it all comes into a whole big picture

177
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,230
another from communication which is on
the oral communication is the art

178
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,769
I'll not just hearing but listening in
this context for purposes up

179
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,620
its to suggest a distinction here the
differences I'd say they're too many

180
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,100
transactions compare bill for reading

181
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,240
such like a shakespearian drama and sing
perform my talent

182
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,160
spokesperson both I'm gonna be
communicating verbally

183
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,010
by I am actually a totally hear it is
different

184
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:53,930
and see you got hearing and listening I
a hearing is observing the words that

185
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,970
are being said

186
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,050
like data collection that may give us
facts about a situation but listening

187
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,750
may give us additional information

188
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,529
that is equally important anomaly in the
words that someone saying to us but

189
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,820
their motions an attitude

190
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,079
contact their analysis I love the some

191
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,560
a above the the score meaning what
they're giving

192
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,040
and so if you're sitting there in your
your hearing up pros

193
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,690
not be given any poetry slam it's going
to be given

194
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,010
we've been different repetition stories
I you be picking up more information

195
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,670
versus just

196
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,950
hearing the words that are just written
out and taken at face value

197
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,910
non-verbal communications are like
facial expressions body language posture

198
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,170
all of these come into play what I look
at a person and I and I see them

199
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,279
out externally in you have to identify
the spacings when my face is

200
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,410
slimmed down and I'm not please it's
gonna come out on my voice

201
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,690
versus arm same time might mine

202
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,190
I might be sad or I might be upset a
body language %uh from slumped

203
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:58,029
I'm not happy %uh my posture upon slaney
over to one side because I'm just kind

204
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:01,430
of bored with this whole talking insists
gone on forever

205
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,579
and wait for the next one to come up
these are

206
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:08,490
just these gestures are more usually
unconscious and I'm

207
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,690
learning to identify them in other
people helps you identify them in

208
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,850
yourself

209
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,360
and you can be more reactive um

210
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,850
and keep a positive image up which helps
expressed that you're not only

211
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,950
interested in what somebody saying that
you're

212
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,750
you want to communicate with them that
you're a vested in the

213
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,100
dialogue that's occurring that may
normally be forgotten

214
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,760
another method that is run porn is a
quiz written communication

215
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,029
you know muscle so we'll have hugging it
really much information from written

216
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,279
communication

217
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,540
you're kinda black-and-white is and it
is net how it's always been set

218
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,810
but you got to letters memos emails text
messages chat messaging

219
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,230
all of these are different methods and
they all have a different type a voice

220
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,720
that gets represented of physical letter
that you my right out

221
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,290
is gonna have a certain pretexts and
post arm

222
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,380
you're going to have a body in an
elements that the work from there

223
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,570
memos going to be much differently
written a short time

224
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,500
shorter side and chat messages and such

225
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,880
this so many technologies that are going
around the San

226
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,160
in we have to be aware of the different
types methods are using so

227
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,880
a text as much different communication
method that you might use than a letter

228
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,839
or memo to your boss arm just being
aware of those is what's really

229
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,260
important is going to be able to help
you

230
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,160
jumpy on their

231
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,750
in written communication there's also
the addiction

232
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,850
that you're gonna perceive the grammar
the spelling

233
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,139
these are all things that we learned in
grade school and

234
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:49,329
the method that we write in helps to
take not only education but the care

235
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:55,040
that we provide to the recipient a I may
use contractions in a certain town or on

236
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,470
me

237
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,720
decide on the news different verbiage

238
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,290
it all comes into play in creating whole
picture

239
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,420
%uh this is one of the things I have a
lot of issues with says 1 I'm not that

240
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,769
great at spelling

241
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:11,480
um but I have 'em more issues with part
of the grammar

242
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,519
I look at it sentence and I want to
dissect it over and over because I

243
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,519
believe that

244
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,209
if I change it its gonna create a a more
lasting impression that I'm going to

245
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,790
have a better connection to my recipient

246
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,899
visual communications you got signs and
symbols

247
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,930
pictures I love these are abilities to
create or interpret signs

248
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,690
that may be helping other person
understand processor flow chart working

249
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,800
to our client a proper permissions

250
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,120
like an office group C may be playable
white boar and working this through

251
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,139
using a giant dawn is a picture some
bills by not appropriate

252
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:51,899
I am and and many appropriate areas but
I might be great here

253
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,220
I'll you know it all depends if you're
with Dave Kennedy or not

254
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,300
I am so really what can we do

255
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,970
a new the core things that that I've
looked at is is knowing your flaws

256
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,440
remembering your strengths I remember to
look

257
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,639
at your your attended audience and think
about how they would perceive yourself

258
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,050
if they were in your dip in the river
spot to read that you were in there

259
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,579
shoes

260
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:21,120
be aware of your surroundings obvious a
lot of us are

261
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,380
go the technical routine are prepared
for many areas but

262
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,139
what is that invoke another people are
they are they frightened because you're

263
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:29,839
carrying

264
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,550
are they are they um scared because you
have a ninth and that's that's uncommon

265
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,389
to them

266
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:38,750
is it necessary to make those things
known and present when you're

267
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,630
in different types of company it might
not be

268
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,230
and that might be the Nikki take that I
wanna provide is that

269
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,639
how can we work with others to

270
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,620
find common ground help them understand
that we're just like other people

271
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,220
and there were no different as being
hackers versus being a an accountant

272
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,279
purse is being a store clerk that we're
all just human and that we're all just

273
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,810
trying to get this world

274
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,350
I love the books that I kinda put some
these findings ther was

275
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,759
big deal Carnegie's book how to win
friends and influence people in it

276
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,899
sounds really ridiculous

277
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:20,230
but if you guys have not read this book
or even heard it its on Amazon for three

278
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,060
dollars

279
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,199
a candle version pick it up its awesome

280
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,949
it's been was written back in 9 1938
knits

281
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:33,880
still true today with all over new forms
a technologies that was ever

282
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,190
back then on the very first help books
but its

283
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,360
it's a really strong concept to
understand

284
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,610
one other people's needs are and tried
to deliver those when you're interacting

285
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,540
with other people because you're gonna
fit in

286
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,470
a lot better and it's not that you have
to change you just have to be aware of

287
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,779
what others are needing

288
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:55,269
and tried to deliver that on nobody
wants you to be different

289
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:59,610
they just want to stir the melting plot
a little bit more

290
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,959
and without mind I know I'm a little bit
shorten time but I'll

291
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,189
you know he got me questions I'll give
it a

292
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:13,189
answering them help me out

293
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:20,400
any questions Mar thank you so much

294
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:21,620
well
