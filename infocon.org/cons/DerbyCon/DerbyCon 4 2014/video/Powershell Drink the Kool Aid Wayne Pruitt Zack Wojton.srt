they're doing

45
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,800
things are going on your system why they
could insert controls

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,790

184
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,240
gotta run any word lined up your cap he
probably got song

185
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,439
this bigger review first and urged all
software in use be doers

186
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:14,029
are show me tell

187
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,279

your father will start function Wong

202
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:32,919
and up in your head is this code block

up %um

204
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,720
the better yet arts org O

205
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,399
yet this is the top which is listed the
functions

206
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,600
they're good i'll make comments toward a
fortune Warren

207

00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:24,299
these two lines throughout your program

228
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:28,220
this structure right now dash for bush
in right dash

as much

246
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,970
our action I've written a module to ps1

247
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:55,560
RPS in one file this for module should
now to load that up

when those power show the warrant

252
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:18,180
modules create a new folder

253
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,759
give it does

254
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:29,759
seen name is your module Capitol auto
capitalizes be syntax Pacific has be the

255
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:31,459
exact same manager module

256

no longer get dash

268
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,419
coming and she pays dash module

269
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:14,629
bulls are all the commands available now
through

270
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:17,729
not Verdugo writer

271
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:21,209
who all age groups you have its total

272
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:26,039
use your word go to module pushed up to
that

273
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:31,049
older cross your car rise now all those
commands are now available

274
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:34,059
so in like I should be before so if we
do you

275

there's a coup that

278
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,099
color block user enters your whole now

279
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:51,519
I didn't do anything except putting some
examples in right

280
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,359
she offered to use maintaining dash

281
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,599
examples banners were examples

282
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,719
generators maybe and rear

283
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,159
you want your code below dollars example

284
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:12,329
stirs hell all it's all there you can
now pipe to results to you export CSV

285
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:13,569
were disliked UK

286
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:17,909
any other any other commands impartial
I'll

287
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:22,079
that worker what's up

288
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,809
or yes which imported under all

322
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:43,969
0 mall well low for lossy

323
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:48,159
model a

324
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,569
I think yeah I think that's it but I'll
look into it

325
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:55,299
musher you

326
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:59,209
for world 0

327
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:02,529
showed were

328
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:06,190
heard

329
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,879
up artsy

330
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:13,289
thirty-minute so a very clear on this
pretty simple

331
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,089
all your questions on global model

332
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:20,309
I'll do it it

333
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:24,719
through art so or go into now a good
goal but I'm

334
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:28,769
home heavy Python guys getting here

335
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:32,649
1220 vision alright so

336
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:37,089
me if you judge them by their website
good to your issue we created a

337
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:40,549
products all does employers

338
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:44,940
she is a windows box checked Willard's
comply with PCI hippo

339
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,329
miss to watch there's wrote it 100
percent power still

340
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:54,879
Whitney eros in a way to botch goes well
as Jackson luxury product

341
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:58,200
100 to check it out skurdal all

342
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,249
solution wall was to use the for water

343
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:05,879
you know what action bar why won't you
sing all

344
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:10,459
wooden boxes so just as written quite
launch group

345
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:14,419
that will I'll base with you 1rm

346
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:17,459
your when will bark injure all our

347
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:20,649
Joker into soul

348
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:24,599
are guys your parcel you rather

349
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,479
so he's gonna go through hell we're
going to explain what he did

350
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:34,409
mom love to see a senior exec me to use
disney will when does is going to do

351
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,539
chrome college books where you got it
from the one who

352
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:41,739
mark route you or him and peek at the
pie

353
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:46,329
initially started our because we didn't
have a tool

354
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:52,269
rivets originally intended for doing
promote compliance evaluation against

355
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:55,399
right hand Red Hat derived

356
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:58,909
operating systems that were not locally
run

357
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:02,859
where they could be locally run it
doesn't matter but when

358
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:06,829
I when R M came out and that's when he
said to

359
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:10,029
makeup or the peek at application

360
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:14,579
and with that as a lot easier because
all the fine you know the pics code

361
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:17,339
everything is organizing a CSP already

362
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:20,759
so as was most workers exodus writing

363
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,029
conversion programs to actually generate
Python modules based on

364
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:28,639
the compliance date out at the peak at
database

365
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:31,809
and Israel or sugar or group yeah

366
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:36,519
said Oh for net with a huge like up
because without the

367
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:40,049
mix version is growing it out by hand
can have an existing data

368
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:44,599
so that was went from late May all the
way up to the began July before that

369
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:48,599
he said it was done and the

370
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:53,440
peek at the pie is organized with the
flossy a train to you

371
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,239
I am emphasize simplicity not having
sections a code that are thousands of

372
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,179
lines long

373
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,109
so no file should be any longer than a
couple pages

374
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:07,549
by any means it just has to be that way

375
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:12,649
and it's also meant that should be
simple to understand and easy to extend

376
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:17,539
so that's where and having then used by
when our am

377
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:22,109
and being used against when missus
windows-based systems came into play

378
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:26,259
and the sophomores organized and
acne-like last fall architecture where

379
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:28,259
there is a wrapper that

380
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:31,869
is used to interface with the user to
accept commands and switches

381
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:36,219
based on what you wanna do and also
populates the piney models to happen to

382
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,879
exist

383
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:42,759
and thank you for C nine here's the
source for its not that much

384
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,019
so it won't take me long to you kinda go
over it

385
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:49,339
let a.m.

386
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:54,710
you need to start cell 'em whether the
help page just like with that

387
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,929
at market model had and

388
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:02,329
this version had does have debug levels
Vegas 2023

389
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:07,849
and 0 will be no appetite whatsoever
except for an HD mouth is generated

390
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:11,429
you go with wine it's very minimal just
showing the finding that happens the

391
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:13,679
processing at that time I am

392
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,450
and if its compliance or noncompliance
and then with two

393
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,619
give some description about the finding
as it they're going along and if you go

394
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:23,229
up to debug level 3

395
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:26,309
blacks you return the standard out from

396
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:30,159
the command it's running remotely so you
can not only tell

397
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,519
rapper findings compliant or not but
also

398
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,219
the output that was used to you this I'm
why

399
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:40,919
and so that was very helpful and
troubleshooting

400
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,629
and the other switches to the president
you can have to seeing

401
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:48,210
specifically nose candy fining or syriza

402
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,589
findings with the banks which where you
can have it go after entire postures so

403
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:53,719
if you want to ski and I E

404
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:59,659
a or rail 6 or Windows 7 2008 r2 12
doesn't matter

405
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:02,809
just as long as it exists and

406
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:06,769
the underlying basis that allows us to
work is

407
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:10,839
I'm there is a model called para mi Co
which allows you to build an SSH

408
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:12,559
sessions

409
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,259
in Python and actually connect other
systems based on SSH

410
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:20,409
so that's what use for doing the else at
the house

411
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:27,409
meant for everything when does highway
Rams what's been used

412
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:32,200
perhaps so since this year

413
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,009
sticking with our show on I can explain
the SSH parliament is gonna go to when

414
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:36,950
are am

415
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,039
and well the session and then wanted the
findings

416
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,559
model scene see what it looks like and
each those models they all look the same

417
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,429
they're just

418
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:51,499
and you know custom built based on what
the pics could

419
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:54,589
and the checkered is

420
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:58,279
so every pic accession

421
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:02,719
a rare peek at the pie session I am it
will always have

422
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:06,639
some kinda I'm CLIA member to it

423
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:09,639
by default if you do not specify an SSH

424
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:14,569
switch already a winner and switch it
seems a local costs of those that's what

425
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:17,109
you get if you don't own anything else

426
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:20,149
and with that hafter that there's lists

427
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:23,489
opinie models that are imported be
somewhat you select

428
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,849
and that's when it leaves through when
its second remote system

429
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:30,129
and there's another member I am your

430
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:33,289
its you can generate an HTML reporter

431
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:37,059
on the obviously not be populated if
it's not the number port its main

432
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:40,450
and then finally the mic debug mode
itself

433
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,899
services the met bid for airing on

434
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:47,579
saying the debug level you know stand
mediate

435
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,969
and obviously the to crystallize

436
00:30:51,969 --> 00:30:58,379
i'm for the win RM he carries at the CSD
data is highly for a man to rise

437
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,999
particularly the checks the pics goes a
lot easier case you actually get the

438
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:03,609
actual could execute

439
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:07,190
but the checks themselves you know it's
based on a table

440
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,479
up operators and what type find it has
to be always talk about issues we did

441
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:12,889
what we did was

442
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:16,049
me we talk reissued power field

443
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:19,419
our show horse I'll

444
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,849
although all the different staters well

445
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:26,169
this UCI book reports all updating

446
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,279
build one massive 0

447
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,039
days it actually is this yeah it looks
like this is his massive

448
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:38,729
on network issues generals who all

449
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:41,919
so going to talk about days this work

450
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,099
grow yeah nice of ask on

451
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:48,359
okay his massive ash so

452
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:52,659
with pssht lie it's pretty
straightforward all as you do it is

453
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:56,569
XQ command against bass cash astaire and
standard out

454
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:59,829
but with he when are am and based on

455
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:03,489
the fact that all the data for doing
checks is parameterized

456
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:06,899
the consul class for when rm has a lot
more

457
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:11,909
inspection and mutation methods to go
along with using system or Paris shell

458
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:15,440
so it specifically their shell methods
want for doing

459
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,509
just system calls only then there's a
shit a.m.

460
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:22,119
a method for doing PowerShell calls and

461
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:25,969
since the majority of the findings are
actually

462
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:30,769
I'm registry equality operators with the
words I decide to put an inspection

463
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:34,259
methods for clearing the registry
without having actually specify the code

464
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:35,989
to do so each time

465
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:40,679
so all over yep use your a beer

466
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,379
I'll see grows all I'm his words
importing the power snooker

467
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:49,429
yet so

468
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:53,629
a try

469
00:32:53,629 --> 00:32:57,349
you look Cup words at a time mind

470
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:02,289
yeah

471
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:06,169
see which yeah how's that

472
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:09,779
than up issue okay

473
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:14,190
when it starts getting astronomical
here's 36

474
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,049
her you

475
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:21,389
act yeah it that's probably a little
much

476
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:24,919
but

477
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,829
ahead take it back

478
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:32,269
squint you know

479
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:37,069
forms yeah right now the only form it's
like putting

480
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:40,779
and is for the presentation class I just
had it generate

481
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:45,029
this standard AR that you would see with
a different debug levels and also basic

482
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:48,259
HTML report that I'll show you

483
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,419
in this is this like a complete your
rightway

484
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:55,509
5 yeah but you just did the math it's
really registry

485
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:59,169
sec add it not up all so there's another
thousand buying to add

486
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:03,959
but then after that incomes Paul Scheer
that was rude lol those were Ruiz's

487
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,259
viewers like in you actually get it at

488
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:10,839
extended she where you want your

489
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:15,069
yep that

490
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:18,179
our debt solutions workers salute you

491
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:21,879
was like were you know I'll

492
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:25,589
yeah okay your they're gone so

493
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:29,329
I'm sleepy and its method inspection
method for any word

494
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:32,440
few words binaries

495
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,629
you have strings of the strings and
that's it here's our poll

496
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:39,239
an finally sec add it and

497
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,909
okay hey here's a finding

498
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:46,440
class itself and every finding is

499
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,779
a class definition did

500
00:34:49,779 --> 00:34:53,569
the oh look very somewhere and that's
what actually populate from the CSV data

501
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:55,119
itself

502
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,849
I'm every fining always have you know it
net members

503
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,480
for you know her both switch out but
tickets generated

504
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,059
and its complied or not and you could
see

505
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:12,119
shares titles identification most these
are actually Stafford static map is its

506
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,460
return static text

507
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,140
day get next shit out from the exit from
the

508
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:23,559
excelente Street near that's right so

509
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:28,679
optional methods are checked and six
depending on what's populated in CST

510
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:33,049
so biking here for here this wine is
it's a

511
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:36,710
you know get reg D word and

512
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,190
it be it's got you know get equal to 1
so

513
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,929
this is where the those methods came in
play from the when are include Coia

514
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:44,920
object

515
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,009
so instead of typing out the you're
having at put into power so can't do all

516
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:49,790
that

517
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:53,170
and get out clean format it's just going
to message that we don't

518
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:58,069
earlier after the pics good this is
already built made it feel like

519
00:35:58,069 --> 00:36:01,279
when the two meet Asian methods for that
so

520
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:05,210
this was parsed directly from this ESPN
just put an ass

521
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,589
on CL I power showcases hers three
parcels

522
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:11,739
exact I'll in those days were greeting
reg

523
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:15,049
years you were you

524
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:18,199
is you I don't that sector

525
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:22,390
are use yep all

526
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,160
sold yellow like going guys like work or

527
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,770
now yeah major boxes for your love it

528
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,589
parties and one thing's the one thing to
be aware of his be very

529
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:37,230
careful with quoting between strong week
quoting

530
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,549
in especially with the president so what
could also be a

531
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:43,880
escape sequence like with the tech
center right now out seeing

532
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,299
escape sequences all throughout here so
usually

533
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:51,890
for particularly with pics good I'm
always always treating as a raw string

534
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,449
and saving single quotes for I'm

535
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:58,679
you know close actually within the
command because those with those

536
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:01,710
regular kweisi be stripped out the
string and you get syntactic

537
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,509
syntactic wires coming back from
PowerShell

538
00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:10,250
but other net the rest the four thousand
bindings look pretty much just like this

539
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:15,020
just nearing at configuration and also
if they actually have picked

540
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,040
so Abington

541
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,859
am peek at the Thai has to emerge either
put in the scan mode road just out at

542
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:23,859
the system

543
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:28,059
show what's opening and it also has a
remediate which will

544
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,849
actually go an attempt to your immediate
spines if

545
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,029
the fix is something that's not
subjective so

546
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:38,849
vertically registry settings for I it's
a good example those are objective nexus

547
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:43,420
their specs coke for that so this
command this is dying

548
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,839
and on speak at the pie but didn't scan
mode

549
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:52,029
you can see it setback pays when R and
switch and

550
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:55,069
on and passed for debug level set three
and I told

551
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:59,140
posture for and 07 and that's going
against a virtual machine on my 10 year

552
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,949
old laptop

553
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:03,949
at so

554
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:07,589
when it comes through their a.m.
particularly with the huge base in fines

555
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:08,920
we have now

556
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,170
there's an exception handling for
invalid syntax for

557
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,719
I'm populated by needs and that's where
this came up with but this is what debug

558
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:21,099
level 3 looks like even though you
probably can't read it

559
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:25,199
activities was there any running are
man's

560
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,779
you scheck you yep and

561
00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:32,920
aid took the labor you doing this
beforehand so you actually get HTML

562
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,599
and center waiting on this the finish so

563
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,630
I am earlier this morning at eleven
o'clock

564
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,759
I'm had to generate the I'm

565
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:46,410
H&R 4x4 peek at the Tigers game the same
here %um

566
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:52,400
same seen p.m. and this was just doing
this game without needing any findings

567
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,699
and the second certainly raise

568
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:03,179
so but the report it's pretty basic I
don't know that much each team out just

569
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:04,569
what I learned on demand to do

570
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:09,150
with so and there's obviously a
compliance call

571
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,380
based on severity of it the high medium
or low

572
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,829
yeah I'm yellow be a lil media might be
orange

573
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:19,719
and hi i'll be read and with the eighty

574
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:24,259
opinion which static methods were
present and the particular funny module

575
00:39:24,259 --> 00:39:29,390
you'll see that posture group ID
happened heartbeat solution ninety

576
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:34,730
and plus the affirmation assurance
standards from your GED

577
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,270
I'm ATI 853 er i so

578
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,869
in on the details I am you have a title

579
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:45,089
plus information about the pining and
also the

580
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:48,730
casting doubt that his return based on
what yep

581
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,750
use K that's pretty much it

582
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,400
and that that that's it a

583
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,650
you

584
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,869
yet so mom we say we're not trying to
make

585
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:08,339
years programmers developers for which
are to be rude to school

586
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,949
om presentation is to show you what you
can do

587
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:16,640
power or all very the building for major
there

588
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,849
all using your extra

589
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:23,270
your UC build modules you george group

590
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:28,000
girl xD I the power so run it from 1x

591
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,730
I'll I mean there's a lot you can do
with it always did you guys

motivated you go out for it and

593
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:42,299
start using it going questions for us

594
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:45,770
areas here orbit solutions dot com

595
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,960
exact likes beer exactly spear about
this

596
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,219
birdies or go so

597
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:57,640

00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,059
and the it is it good

599
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:05,380
ever model you could

600

yes good well yes yes

603
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,579
you remember that the module is your
only for me it and study the

604
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:24,290
you before you like goat herder bird
equals d-conn said

605
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,540
bought from there in the wrong for me
and you would use

606
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,940
brought your guitar part that your
YouTube Twitter

all Hugo it's easy

610
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:51,089
you go yeah you know where the HTML is
generated in the context

611
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:54,279
the Python interpreter those who are did
all

612
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:57,829
Yahoo HTML are those

613

614
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:05,020
you know I'll uses worked as you see

615
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,089
me Aug your goals for building agrees

616
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:13,369
free from the longest rooms sucks it

617
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:17,039
yeah good

618
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,140

because all-seeing

620
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,890
60 all if you really want to know who is
in a mock

621
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:31,940
for more remember you like that OC yep
where r

622
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,770
CPU being call though

623
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:38,809
parcels you I'll also

624
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:42,670
slight low water bottle

625
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,270
