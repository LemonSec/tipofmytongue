1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:07,199
is now so in the grand tradition oven

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,880
screwing things up and and doing hacker
con stuff we're gonna

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,950
run without slides because hopefully
it's all recorded

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,970
and been living color and video

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,100
that's exactly what I meant to do right
we got that just make sure you're paying

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,090
attention

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,310
yes alright so I will kick this off

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,529
on I'm both words as a spacer ok over to
be talked about

9
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:35,079
I and the Kaveri and the last year so
just by showing hands although I can't

10
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,690
see it because there's a bright light in
my eyes

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,600
but who was here last year for Derby
Conn congress

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,690
see if you have not there very good

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,050
very good so on this is gonna be new for

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,520
everybody I think the folks are here
last year you get to see

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,829
you know the historical perspective as
well as where we've come since then

16
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,030
and things have changed a lot so up

17
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,230
we're gonna go over what is I am a
calorie

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,519
I'm sure everybody's probably heard
about it if not you will today and then

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,530
but go through what we went through in
the last year just briefly

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,409
review it um see what the what lessons
we learnt

21
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,150
I what we found out not to do and so the
surprises

22
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,330
and then talk about what we're going to
do in the coming year there to highlight

23
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,680
the

24
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,280
Firestar auto cyber safety safety
framework

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,570
and some other outcomes that come from
up so

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,030
I and the Kaveri the problem statement
is

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,100
that up were adopting connected
technology faster than we're able to

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,770
secure it

29
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,950
so when you look at things like
automobiles like medical devices like

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,990
public infrastructure and other things

31
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,700
these are all devices that have the
potential to impact

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,290
human life and public safety as these
traditionally non computerized non

33
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,780
connected devices

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,939
are having computers and conductivity
put into them

35
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,520
we want to make sure that we're not
transplanting the same security problems

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,310
into those devices because I wear it I
am

37
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,149
bits need bone as we can I say that's
where you have real safety issues

38
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:14,280
the mission statement is to insure
connected technologies with the

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,739
potential to impact public safety and
human life

40
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,940
are worthy of our trust and we really
feel like the the trustworthiness

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,500
aspect is a good one there's a balancing
act between

42
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,890
making people aware the issues and

43
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,260
not destroying the trust in the people
who are you going to buy those and adopt

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,599
them

45
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,019
so we didn't come up with this mission
statement out of thin air

46
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:39,349
a lot of this was with sorting

47
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,650
distilled from the Congress last year
that we had here Derby

48
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,379
we also a had refined it grew Hanisch
moon a b-side San Francisco

49
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:50,920
we gather input from a large number of
people

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,140
up I think we had a hundred people in
our room here Derby Conn last year

51
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,050
are all day the entire day we had a
large contributor who had allowed review

52
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,280
because I temperatures go

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,970
and all those people had input into what
this mission statement should be

54
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,150
and this is what be boiled down into to
try to get the pure essence of what

55
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,620
the Calgary should be focusing on the

56
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,819
yeah exactly and just to let you know

57
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,920
when during this mission statement
outside of the security community

58
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,730
um this is a version that really
resonates with people who

59
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,290
you know don't even understand
technology necessarily but

60
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,150
they hear what we had to say and I call
that make sense i've seen. Internet of

61
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,200
Things Are I've gotta

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,200
you know a computer in my car now um so
they're really

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,680
it helps them get it get why we're doing
what we're doing

64
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,180
on and as I mentioned we we broke this
out into four quadrants

65
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,129
last year at the congress um we really
focused in on these four

66
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:53,580
so we had the idea that maybe these four
areas should be

67
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,879
kinda verticals are pillars of what
we're talking about and at the congress

68
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,340
that really solidified with us the
reason we broke it up into these four

69
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,060
is because there are similar chains have
influence

70
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,040
within each of these verticals meaning
you know medical devices

71
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,489
you have could have a unique setup from

72
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,660
a just to ecosystem with physicians with
patients

73
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,070
wish hospital buyers with regulatory
agencies

74
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,780
the same thing is true with automotive
each one of these is unique

75
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,630
abut they have similarities amongst the
different groups within that

76
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,580
pillar if you go back to the mission
statement public safety and human life

77
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,509
right all for these these verticals a
that we're focusing on

78
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,750
impact public safety and/or human life
for both

79
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,250
and that's why we've broken is out into
these four groups are so focused I'll

80
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,300
yeah and that's really critical for us a
what are the things that

81
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,949
that came out after becoming Congress
last year too is the idea that

82
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,419
I am safety how now

83
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,610
day's going to do something bad who

84
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,139
call you alright

85
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,620
you got an opener %uh no open our cat
sorry

86
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,889
on is it at West cook

87
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,080
so with in

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,220
it almost died day I that's right safety

89
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,270
I'll so we originally started out we're
going to this a little bit later

90
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,740
with three separate pillars but we
realized is that I was we were talking

91
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,020
we got the most residents out I love

92
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,729
public safety in human life issues on
there are other people doing some other

93
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:35,550
things that we initially started out
talking about

94
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,530
and we found that there wasn't nearly
the amount attraction in this area

95
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,270
there weren't nearly the number of
groups and the number of action that was

96
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,289
going on

97
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:47,380
on and we felt that doing a public
safety initiative

98
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,680
was really going to buy our community
the right to then inject ourselves into

99
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,220
some the other discussions

100
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,120
that we're having um when you when you
say people are gonna die

101
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,139
it really helps you to get outside the
echo chamber down people start listening

102
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:00,680
to you

103
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,190
yeah it's itself highly related to what
most people do right i mean we all got

104
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,509
cars just about

105
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,620
a lot of people have family members or
friends with medical devices or

106
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,810
who have been saved by certain medical
devices

107
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,340
I everybody's heard of the Internet of
Things everybody knows that

108
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,250
that all these things exist so it's more
tangible more visceral for people

109
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,830
and they can really get behind a better
you think party the issues that

110
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,319
we've all been talking about this for
years and years and years right

111
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,430
amongst ourselves we all know what the
problems are

112
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,949
we've been in the industry for los
alamos avenging anyway we all know the

113
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:36,740
problem are

114
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,530
problems are and we all talk about this
amongst ourselves but people are

115
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,710
developing a product or build the price
for using the products

116
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,830
day may not be aware of these issues and
that's why we need to

117
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,729
but talk beyond ourselves and get
outside of ourselves

118
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,740
outside or echo chamber and talk to
other industries and other people

119
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,080
so that we can bring awareness to those
things to them right

120
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,069
on and something else that came out %uh
the Derby Conn congress we did last year

121
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:06,009
as well as it was reinforced later in
some the conversations we had

122
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,819
is we really need to focus on talking
outside

123
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:12,889
love the echo chamber like space said
right

124
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,930
we all know the issues an it's great to
sit here and admire the problem you have

125
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,169
to do a certain amount of figuring out
what the problem really is

126
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:24,849
to be able to solve it but once you got
it really kinda figured out

127
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:27,990
and what you know some other solutions
then you have to go out

128
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,330
and change the world right you have to
put those into practice

129
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,870
and we can't do that just amongst
ourselves if we could have

130
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,319
these things would've been solved
already right we wouldn't have another

131
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:40,050
Hartley wouldn't have these things like
shell shocked that

132
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,759
that came out on so doing education

133
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,970
outreach actually getting outside of the
the security community outside a

134
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,060
contarte

135
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,160
I'm going to talk to regular people and
then

136
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,220
promoting research essentially taking
the work that's already being done by

137
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,150
really smart people in the community

138
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,419
and broadcasting it better being able to
interject that into

139
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:06,129
media stories be able to highlight that
in public policy

140
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:09,520
discussions and and bring that I'll

141
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,090
um so this is a

142
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,370
grassroots organization essentially um
it's just a bunch of passionate

143
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,160
volunteers who decided to come together
and do something

144
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,090
we saw the problem I we wanted to fix
the problem I think you clicked on a key

145
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,990
point we'll probably talk about it again
more

146
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,599
up group of talented passionate
volunteers

147
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,719
we'll have day jobs solvers our day jobs
are more taxing than others

148
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,279
I'll and we are volunteers knows get
paid for any this right now

149
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,930
and I want to keep that in mind as you
go through is talking talk was almost

150
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,570
doubled over last year

151
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,100
um i think is consider all volunteers a
part-time even less the part I'm really

152
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,730
Osborne oppressive what we have
accomplished so far

153
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,649
yep and we've got really a long-term
vision so

154
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,100
summer the folks we've talked to they
haven't really gotten

155
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,890
why we're doing what we're doing until
we start saying okay well we're looking

156
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,800
at five years down the road 10 20 30 40

157
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,399
right we all know that there are
vulnerabilities that their

158
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,510
issues and products that are out there
today and

159
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,140
those are really hard to fix right I
mean how do you

160
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,970
talk to a medical device company and say
hey but want to just spend $10 or $20

161
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,680
million dollars to go out and fix this
product line you've got

162
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,660
and oh yeah you've got thirty other
product lines that are also vulnerable

163
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,790
in our office continue that you're not
making any money or a more

164
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,600
nobody's buying threat but we want you
to fix them because they're out there on

165
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,260
the field now

166
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,190
right um you know that's the traditional
security

167
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,740
mentality is let's fix the things that
are there now right it's a it's a very

168
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,760
prioritized approach in that way

169
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,830
we took that we kinda flipped it on its
head we said right

170
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,230
if we can't get traction here let's not
give up

171
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,000
let's keep going let's get traction
somewhere else so maybe products there

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,330
in the design phase you just go and
influence a couple decisions

173
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,670
so that the decision makers to people
who are building the things now

174
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,860
they make a little bit smarter choices
that they realize okay well if I don't

175
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,040
have to have Bluetooth connectivity

176
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,079
to change the treatment on somebody's
implantable cardiac device

177
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,190
that maybe I don't have Bluetooth maybe
I don't look that

178
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,240
implantable device up to wifi maybe
instead I use near field communications

179
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,450
which has a much much smaller area the
fact

180
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,860
um and energy I had encryption back yet
and encryption and authentication is the

181
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,260
pot

182
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,610
add the simple things that we all know
are really really basic

183
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,680
but that people who aren't used to
building software

184
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,640
they might not know that that you need
to do those things right don't think

185
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,940
about those adversarial scenarios for
the accidental impact from things

186
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,640
and then even beyond things that are in
design and being built right now

187
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,910
how do you fix entire industry how do
you fix

188
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:49,360
an organization a car maker and get them
to adopt

189
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,709
a secure development life cycle right
that's not something that's going to

190
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:54,410
change products in the field

191
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,850
but as we're deploring deploying more
and more

192
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,260
devices that are can computerized and
connected

193
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,269
that becomes a big thing do you think
about I'm

194
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,370
in certain industries you have a
forty-year eighty-year replacement cycle

195
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,010
right nuclear facilities you don't want
the you don't wanna replace things very

196
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,529
often

197
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:16,410
right it makes sense for them to have
that long

198
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,560
replacement cycle an upgrade cycle but

199
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,170
the decisions we're making today the
things we're putting in the field today

200
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,480
are going to be with us for a long time
so if we can fix

201
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,620
something that's going to be sold five
years from now so that it doesn't have

202
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:37,220
long-term security impacts data when

203
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,959
up and one other things we found with
the the house

204
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,160
is we're going around collecting
existing research

205
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,260
and researchers talking to people
building up

206
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,810
library building up a rolodex a people
that we can go to when there's certain

207
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,850
subject matter

208
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,589
a expertise needed we are connecting
those people

209
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:00,000
to industry to public policy makers to
media

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,029
to whoever they need to be able to talk
with to

211
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:06,820
from to influence think what their
surprise me drug last year as we we

212
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,279
started doing it started talking to
different people is there a lot of

213
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,389
people

214
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:13,459
who are doing small part to this

215
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,120
and do out there on their own in North
they're working on their one's partner

216
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,730
trying to get their information now

217
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,279
on their one product to their one
vertical and their out there

218
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,670
and so we collect them and we gather
them together so that we now know who

219
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,070
these people are

220
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,110
so that when we reach out to other
people say hey you know

221
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,149
we can point them to John who's working
on that topic

222
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:35,540
in right and we want to collaborate

223
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,850
bring people together in sit them down
in a room you know

224
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,070
we're at an event in black cat around
black cat area and and time frame

225
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:47,130
there was an invite-only event for
Internet of Things people so we had

226
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,230
medical device makers we had automakers

227
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,560
we had Internet of Things makers we had
public infrastructure makers

228
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,670
we got them with some really smart
security researchers

229
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,100
to meet each other turns out people in
industry that

230
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,420
we thought were maybe clueless and they
didn't know a thing they actually know a

231
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,779
lot they'd all lot more about what
they're doing

232
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:10,510
didn't we do right they live it every
day what these people have been trying

233
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,200
for months and years

234
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,420
to get more security into the products
into the devices

235
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,790
they need a little bit help and that's
what we want to do to

236
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,930
to capitalize was positive action before
it might have happened otherwise

237
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,589
in isolation acting alone

238
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,589
um and finally the name so

239
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,560
the original concept for I am a calorie
cause a lot of people ask

240
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,889
is we looked around for

241
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:40,630
who is making sure that somebody's
thinking about these things

242
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,250
that the decision makers are informed
about risk so putting conductivity in

243
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,570
computers Asian

244
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,290
into Internet of Things we found a
really wasn't anybody

245
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,870
right the idea is the cavalry is not
coming to save us

246
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,199
it it falls to us we must be the cavalry

247
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,399
and I and the calories a personal call
to action

248
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,920
for each and every one of us to do
something that's in the right direction

249
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,279
the name I mcalary isn't you know

250
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,360
a group of people saying I am the
gallery is supposed to be

251
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,190
everybody everybody individually saying
I am a calorie

252
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,649
and that's what the difference is yeah
that's probably where the biggest

253
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,360
criticisms that we've gotten nor

254
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,649
questions we've gotten on from people
who were

255
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:28,060
who haven't gone through this so talk
before I listen to it is they just don't

256
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,139
understand it

257
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,339
and it is kinda confusing it's something
that

258
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,399
we didn't mean for it to become in a min
stick around as for year

259
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,790
but it has the temporary supposed to be
temporary for the initial talking and

260
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,670
Gary are your later we have changed

261
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,990
yeah the but on you know the good thing
is for some probably not going to at

262
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,010
this point ads

263
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,380
well we'll talk about that about I some
people actually really like it and it's

264
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,459
been beneficial so

265
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,610
we like that part of it um

266
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,620
so the Kaveri all started we'll it is a
little bit

267
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,110
last year at the sides Las Vegas Josh a

268
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,899
Josh Corman and Nick for Coco set up and
get first talk on this

269
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,170
and def conduct on 21

270
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,560
and just introduced the idea the concept
if you owned

271
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,510
seen that talk it's pretty good talk cut
it was given

272
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,050
several other times but that was the
initiation point

273
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,360
and there were three main planks to the
platform

274
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,760
three things that we want to accomplish
rank up

275
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,180
the body which is human life

276
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,000
public safety um mind which is right to
research

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,279
right criminalization research bad laws
like CFAA

278
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,459
and and Digital Millennium Copyright Act

279
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,540
which criminalize computer research up
because they're

280
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,680
really old right when they were written
the world is a different place

281
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,759
on and install civil liberties issues

282
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,259
um see if it was 1986

283
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:57,410
sorry eighty yes something like dial up
yeah

284
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,519
modem so what is on offer rise access
mean yeah

285
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:03,980
its own internet world those laws have
changed almost nine

286
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,019
since then but right I'm rambling sorry
yes

287
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:10,430
that's fine not I'll on so again

288
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,699
one thing is clear: the cover is
becoming a false to your fault all the

289
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:15,459
sternest cavalry

290
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,660
and we started out we said look these
are the goals you want to accomplish in

291
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,630
your 0

292
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,990
the first year love doing this we just
want to test the waters right we wanna

293
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,480
see

294
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,190
whether or not this idea is feasible can
we actually go out and make some change

295
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,269
I don't think anybody realize that
sorted a

296
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:36,350
reaction attention that we would get
neck and Josh would get

297
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,149
I mean I'll admit when I first heard
about the talk that way it's a stupid

298
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:40,709
idea

299
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,880
I there's not going to work and i
actually hurt his paw

300
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,209
right I'm and johnson et actually
presented a very good case

301
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:52,160
at hours ago that's a little different
that actually

302
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,480
has some possibilities and that's what
brought me and it got me involved

303
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,279
so I think the feasibility testing was
to try to see I think any of us really

304
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,440
realize how much it was gonna drawing
people

305
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,809
yeah I was kinda amazing I mean most
initiatives they get started in their

306
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:06,760
first year in

307
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,419
nobody's heard about him it takes two or
three years before they really get

308
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:10,439
wrapped up

309
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,770
with us we're on the main stage from the
very beginning and

310
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,059
the idea was viral it's a i

311
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:20,189
you know caught cannot call to search
type thing

312
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,470
and everybody in our industry on being

313
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,799
no good guys security folks a good guys
and ladies

314
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,169
being security folks really want to
protect people we want to help

315
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:33,190
right um our idea was to

316
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,820
to try a bunch a different things fail a
lot of them

317
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,490
but fine ones that really succeeded and
then do those more

318
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,700
and the ones that failed not to them as
much and I think we did a pretty good

319
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,610
job at

320
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,740
failing anyways we we had some successes
to which we built on a lot

321
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,850
and so as we talk about what work-up
gonna do in the next year

322
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,870
that's mainly based off the successes
that we had and building on this

323
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,530
um we wanted to really define the
problem space like I said

324
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,900
you can't um know how to solve a problem

325
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,809
unless you define that well so we've
mapped out a lot of the issues we've

326
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,760
refined our message got into more of a
core sentiment

327
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,539
that we think works for a lot of that
problem space defining happened right

328
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:15,110
here

329
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,330
last year it in a room downstairs for 12
hours the cramped in a hundred people on

330
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,390
a hot sweaty Rome

331
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,730
de palma but it was very helpful I need
it we flushed out a lot of ideas in our

332
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,390
room

333
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:29,809
and I think that without that input from
folks here at Derby Conn and b-sides

334
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,049
I sepsis go and other places me would
you

335
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:36,059
not be where we are right right

336
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,270
and we did gather a lot of like-minded
people there a lot of folks that

337
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,360
we met I'm just going along do nothing

338
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,549
who they're really believe in changing
the world and they really believe in

339
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:51,059
fixing some other problems that are out
there

340
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,010
because you know more than anything we
want to leave a legacy that is

341
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,020
good that is a better future than we
found it

342
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,020
the against project to be anamensis
before cyst how many people

343
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,860
were kinda sorta already working on
stuff on there all by himself

344
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,730
and that we were able to gather them
together until Josh

345
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,700
and and Nick had their talk and shorting
galvanized people and

346
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,169
brought everybody together and do me a
surprise the quality know somebody's

347
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:19,250
working on adding notes

348
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,309
that this guy was reconnaissance now we
try and gather all that together into

349
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:24,490
one big group

350
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,600
yeah i i think about it is I you'll
probably see no science videos where you

351
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,169
have a super-saturated

352
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,890
glass a water and it's got a lot of
sugar in it you know what was on it I'm

353
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,990
I'm sure you do I do I'm a science geek
am NOT going to apologize for that

354
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,010
up but does this class a war it's got
lots of sugar in it but it's not

355
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,700
crystallized out and the drop in a
single grain a sugar

356
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,220
and it just all a aggregates around that
right that's the seed that starts the

357
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,270
chain of events

358
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:54,350
as the most popular video on YouTube
with a knife I think it is Tabitha

359
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,730
but they do it right take your word for
it if we get a dancing cat till I drop

360
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,270
the sugar and maybe I would work

361
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,929
we should get started on that um we
wanted to

362
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:07,760
that's not all our videos right sonya
routes we also want to map out the champ

363
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,559
influence right

364
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,340
what does it actually take to get
something solved on how do you go in and

365
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,650
talk to policymakers

366
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,030
who does what in congress I didn't know
I mean

367
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,919
I spent enough time in DC a over my life
that

368
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,230
I probably should have known it I
high-tech high school civics and

369
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,570
i watch mister smith goes to washington
but like how all these things really

370
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,390
work together

371
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,390
that's just one small subsection it
doesn't work like you think it does

372
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,210
no done surprise you and not in a good
better or worse way

373
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,960
just due to the realities of the world
and it takes time to learn those

374
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,720
realities

375
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,470
don't learn who influences who if we
need to talk to you to get to talk to

376
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,539
somebody else

377
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:49,659
and that's thats takes time

378
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:53,059
dust it does on so

379
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,659
turns out that some organizations are
way more influential than

380
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:00,059
you might think there are certain
standards making organizations that

381
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,460
in the auto industry in the medical
industry they have more power than

382
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,429
in congress they have more power than
the board of directors have some these

383
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,370
companies

384
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,230
this actually set the direction for some
other things that are going into cars

385
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,320
for medical devices are on
infrastructure

386
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,980
public infrastructure whatever I we want
reform supplant you are too kind I think

387
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,950
about this

388
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,530
figure it out consider it and then move
forward

389
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,820
which triggered the worst thing we could
do is just go out

390
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,179
you know do a buncha stuff maybe it's
all wrong in

391
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:32,470
and we get take it back now and and burn
some other good will that we got

392
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,480
on so we wanted to really carefully
approach

393
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,090
some other things while trying some
different one side see what worked

394
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,440
how I lost my better I might have to be
do manually

395
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,409
have a horrible on so one other things
we did as we mentioned

396
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:54,059
collecting I'm we collected a lot of
people there are a lot of really cool

397
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,880
people working in industry:

398
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,970
there are a lot of people who change
jobs so they are working in industry now

399
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,380
they were before and they're doing that
at a census

400
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,549
pay if I'm not going to do this maybe
nobody is

401
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:10,210
so I'm going to step in and take a
career with her car maker with medical

402
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,530
device manufacture

403
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,140
I'm be we a

404
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,220
we did it a lot of finding research

405
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,320
we collected a lot of prior research
talked with a lot a really good

406
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,070
researchers

407
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,530
water academics as well people who maybe
don't shop at conferences but we've done

408
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,559
some really foundational stuff

409
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,630
um talked the other day with a guy named

410
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:39,169
stephan savage who in 2010 was doing
some %uh the first car acting stuff

411
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:42,740
a man without going into details in his
research that I'll know what's public

412
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,020
and what's not and

413
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,419
most it's been fixed by now but was able
to remotely

414
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,490
take over a car from 1500 miles away
like that stuff that like Charlie and

415
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,850
Chris weren't doing

416
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,230
the head have physical access but
because if the early now so this

417
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,020
research

418
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,760
was really foundational mean that
further research are they gonna surprise

419
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,110
Muniz mention the car park if you look
at our

420
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,770
automotive is actually try to do some
research to find the research

421
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,140
the reverse on Armada page in some other
stuff goes back to the nineties Jack

422
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,100
and is just their academic papers that
nobody ever pay any attention to but the

423
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,900
research has been done as documented in
its written up

424
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,360
and repeatable I'll and so it's now

425
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,510
listed and we can refer to it and re for
other people to and say she's also did

426
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,460
this twenty years ago

427
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,650
right judge um go in talking to people
in the government was not as scary as we

428
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,780
thought it was

429
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,350
we found some people were actually
really really smart and want to talk to

430
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,360
us and want to talk to us with
surprising

431
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,480
absolutely I mean now having
conversations with some the agencies

432
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,460
that we did

433
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,570
up and they're saying look we don't have
this figured out

434
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,630
will you please come and talk to us will
you come inform the people who are

435
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,720
making the decisions in our organization

436
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,179
because we don't have a clue on the
server security stuff just got dumped

437
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:55,039
into our lap

438
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,070
now have to try and deal with it on
talking with

439
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:01,990
congressional staffers who are our
generation and younger

440
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,049
so there very highly technically
literate and they'd get some other

441
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:08,299
consequences of security issues

442
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:12,270
they put together research at a academic
and professional level

443
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,450
its way better than anything I could
have done you know and produced for the

444
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,110
security industry

445
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,669
I'll in some cases some other stocks we
have the government a very high level

446
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:26,740
and not very to a overview type but in a
lot of cases it was very needy greedy

447
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,539
technical

448
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:32,070
low-level details stop was kinda blew
will be away I was expecting that

449
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,809
I'll so is very again is very surprising

450
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,059
and very interesting to see that not
only was there that interest but there

451
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:40,700
was that knowledge level there

452
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,400
at the government side which is
something that you know as a civilian

453
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,000
you don't usually expect from the idiot
government right

454
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,039
but job they're not as stupid as their
lead to bleed

455
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,150
but we are led to believe right in

456
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,070
on and we found a lot of willing allies

457
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:00,179
in the industries that we're looking at
plot a medical device manufacturers we

458
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,840
talk to people on the phone

459
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,480
on third serious oh man I'm so glad that
you guys are doing this you're talking

460
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,260
about it

461
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,860
um one one person one organization said

462
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,360
I've been talking about this stuff for
years but every time

463
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,549
I see a hack up this type of device

464
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:21,289
I get funding to do what I need to do
every time there's a news article that

465
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:21,900
my

466
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,010
boss resume I CEO reads I get more
funding to do what I need to do

467
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,860
I think that's really cool that's great
that's something that we didn't expect

468
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,240
necessarily to happen

469
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,700
but we found that that we've got a lot
more friends and a lot more places than

470
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,549
we thought we did

471
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:41,650
we had a lot of press up the the
journalists that

472
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,289
we know from you know past lives as well
as met doing this

473
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:48,330
the really receptive to this I think
because it

474
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,640
it has some aspect of sensationalism to
it but

475
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,929
we mostly play down the sensational
parts and talk about what needs to be

476
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:56,870
done in the future

477
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,059
know where we going with this how do we
need to think about these issues

478
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,250
and we're talking about it in a way that
maybe everybody doesn't your everyday

479
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,130
on so they like the idea of some other
things that we're doing

480
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,850
we'll talk about this in a minute um
that we were able to hopefully play down

481
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,020
the hype aspect on the press a bit

482
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,330
but there are other aspects to the press
that we didn't really manage that well

483
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,539
mom will cover them to bed are you have
a question

484
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:24,070
yeah and we put out some deliverables

485
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:27,580
you know on talking at conferences is a
deliverable

486
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,590
you go and educate inform a lot of
people again going back to

487
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,220
what we're how we're trying to
accomplish our goal we want to educate

488
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,730
people want to reach out

489
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,770
we want to go in and talk to folks are
in the industry's we want to put out

490
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,480
things like

491
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,510
five Star Auto cyber safety framework we
want to throw up a website so that

492
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,750
anybody can come

493
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,140
see what we think about certain issues
director them to certain

494
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,340
videos are taxed or people who are doing
good things in industry

495
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,940
us we put out a lot of stuff and you you
probably hurt seen and heard some other

496
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,929
in

497
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:07,500
and this is a some other conferences
that we went to this year

498
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,710
and I think that the result like to
slide his cuz it

499
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,000
helps to tell a story and I know you can
see the far-right a bit but that's fine

500
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,179
you will on the video I'll this is the
one slide were topping off the right

501
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:18,460
side kinda matters

502
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,500
yeah but I indeed been as good as he is
it getting the stuff up

503
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,899
I'm sure he'll do a great job you be
able to see it probably as we close

504
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:30,549
um but again started at Def Con

505
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,880
and decides last year um the congress
that we did hear

506
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,600
talked a lot about that was immensely
helpful for us to focus

507
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,149
to get direction to bring on more people
who were

508
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:45,669
were willing allies we actually had a
lot of people travel to Derby Conn

509
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:49,899
just to come to that car congress does
very helpful and I want to personally

510
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:51,429
thank everybody who did that

511
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:55,220
yes it showed up at the congress um I
think without your input

512
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,299
that we wouldn't be here today right up

513
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:03,860
there is a text that there Josh Corman
did where he spoke and he talked about

514
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,220
I'm swimming with apex predators as an
sharks

515
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,990
right going shark diving and then he
gotta

516
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,500
the the water got into his brand new car
with Bluetooth

517
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,539
with computers and realized that he was
swimming with apex predators a

518
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,710
the digital ocean I'm she'll forgive the
hyperbole and buzzwords

519
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,990
up and the the reception that

520
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,990
dat talk got has been really good from
the general public

521
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,570
right it was a way to reach out to talk
to people who don't know the technology

522
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,529
or don't care to know the technology

523
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:40,870
and get them to pay attention drawing
that analogy

524
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,659
really help them understand I'm what the
risks are in and

525
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:48,710
how we need to go about addressing which
is bob Corker

526
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,899
so about a slider on the left this is
refining the message and on the right

527
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,230
the part that you can see

528
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,340
says expanding reach if you actually
look at that as a graph from the left to

529
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:58,770
the right

530
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,049
overtime right when we started out a
year ago

531
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,830
we working on refining our message that
was part of the congress year was four

532
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,179
the party would be tight emphasis code
we did there we had our meeting a blue

533
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:09,750
hat

534
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,630
on where we try to refine our message
come up with a mission statement

535
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,850
our core core activities that we want to
follow and on the right side which is

536
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,909
expanding reach

537
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:22,899
that trial gets larger and larger over
time as we surely get our press and

538
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,179
expand our and try to reach more people

539
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:28,419
all mmm and various areas we just

540
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:31,720
to reach more people so we're expanding
reach and refining message so the

541
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,520
message

542
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,860
is getting very fine to now and the
Reach is getting much larger

543
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:42,100
right on at Shrek on we ran something
similar to what we did here

544
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,020
but a little bit more narrow in scope
earlier just focused on

545
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,549
defining the mission kinda galvanizing
that we also did a similar thing at the

546
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:53,809
side San Francisco in preparation for
our essay

547
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:57,260
where our essay gave us a a booth for
all three days

548
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,760
are four days are made as a cop it ran
for every job forever

549
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,890
a and we were able to get the message
out to people who wouldn't come to a

550
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,980
conference like this

551
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,990
right i mean executives love large
companies

552
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,960
who were at Rs a came by and talk to us
about I mccaffery so that was really

553
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,730
cool

554
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:18,419
something else we did at the side San
Francisco was we ran some workshops

555
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,440
um we did immediate workshop with

556
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,090
Jan should be doing a stable talk
tomorrow and then on

557
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,789
will be doing another media workshop
caught engaging the media API

558
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:32,870
trying to to help you understand how to
get involved in

559
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,010
changing media is perception other sand
and changing the story

560
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:40,450
focusing the story on what matters um
we've really likes the idea of doing

561
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,649
those workshops

562
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:45,360
love helping build muscles within this
community

563
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,440
that we might not have by working on
computers right

564
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,480
that we might not get I unless we we
seek it

565
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,770
so by bringing that capability

566
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,220
to the folks here in this room in this
community were

567
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,659
were making everybody a little bit
smarter little bit better at things that

568
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:05,700
are maybe not traditionally part of what
they would do on

569
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,130
one of the things we found is as we
build muscles to do I mcalary work

570
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,309
it also helped us in our day jobs so it
helps us

571
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:16,330
talk to management a little bit better
it helps us get the point across it

572
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,850
helps a strong allergies

573
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,769
go talk to my mom about this stuff
because at some other things I've

574
00:31:20,769 --> 00:31:23,480
learned the way I have learned to you

575
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,250
use my words in a non-technical way non
jargon chilled way

576
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,299
um out at thought kandi such Chicago

577
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:35,500
we did something similar on each day we
had a really really cool car hacking

578
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,340
workshop Craig Smith from open garages
came in

579
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,610
and sat down and talk people how to
reverse engineered the can-bus

580
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,539
which is the communications between all
the sensors and computers in your car

581
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:49,940
I was really cool we like doing those
kinds of things again

582
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,380
his party outreach and education that
we're doing um

583
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,570
the that the party is lighter that you
can see we did an event at

584
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:02,179
a black cat that I already mentioned
which is about 50 researchers and people

585
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:03,440
from industry

586
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,010
on brought them together that was kind
of a proof-of-concept for what we want

587
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,169
to do more of

588
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:11,779
which is make those connections to
people sitting in the room

589
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:15,640
understand that you know the folks that
were trying to reach and influence

590
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,360
are also trying to reach into lots of us
to work together

591
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,200
to solve some of these heart problems
that we all care about

592
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,370
um what worked well a the the problem
statement

593
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:32,470
the mission the timing when we talk
about the problem statement the mission

594
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,149
with people

595
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:37,539
it really resonates kinda surprised at
how well that went over

596
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,600
the timing um for some reason we just
got lucky

597
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,200
right it's the right time for this kinda
message lot of people have tried to do

598
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,769
things like this before and

599
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:50,169
but it hasn't gotten picked up because
maybe the world wasn't ready for it

600
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:53,299
so we know that that's a large part of
our success

601
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:56,360
up we also found that

602
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,990
that bringing people together I'm was
really really successful

603
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,760
just getting people in the same room
together oftentimes is

604
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,990
is half the the victory I'm especially
people with different perspectives

605
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,399
different points of view

606
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,750
different a abilities that they can use

607
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,809
to the influence into

608
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:19,990
to change the world I'm we found that

609
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,559
I we need all those different
characteristics

610
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:26,909
on there is a a good

611
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:30,140
talk that trade 0 gave

612
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,269
a at you give it here first first time I
saw don t waste

613
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:39,090
and he's giving it a couple times
subsequently it's about building a guild

614
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,140
on there are certain things that you can
accomplish

615
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,620
up solo there are certain things we need
some teammates

616
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,570
and there are certain things where you
need really specialized resources to be

617
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,700
able to go out

618
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,190
and affectively do we're trying to do to
do so in the

619
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,679
the easiest way she people who are going
to take a lot of damage

620
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,740
you people who may be a in the press and
get beat up by

621
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,840
you know whoever doesn't agree with what
we're saying

622
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,359
you need people who are on the back and
then healing them making sure that

623
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:11,839
they don't lose hope that they don't
stop making sure that they're

624
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,530
energized and power you need people who
can really get into the details

625
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,669
to figure out the technology to build
the way forward

626
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:23,040
so that when somebody comes to ask for
advice you have the right advice to give

627
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,849
them

628
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:26,879
on and I think we found that that is
something that

629
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,720
that we really need to do we need to get
better out at we need to do more of that

630
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,329
in the next year

631
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:37,060
um we were good at finding other people
to make us smarter

632
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:40,109
right we don't have all the answers I
don't know it's

633
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:44,060
anybody has all the answers raise your
hand a I didn't think so

634
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:49,389
on so up having other people come in and
talk to us tell us

635
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:52,389
well you know here's the way things
actually work sec

636
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:56,139
0 you know like goes off realizing that

637
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:00,260
those people are always going to be
smarter at at those things than we are

638
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:05,050
and using them that taking advantage of
what they do what they specialize in to

639
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,480
get going back to that killed concept

640
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,240
um you and we really got a lot about
side interested feedback

641
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,099
people who are and security echo chamber
people who are in industry or

642
00:35:16,099 --> 00:35:19,510
a private citizens are just you know
somebody on the street

643
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:24,230
iris have a conversation in London at
with some guys stand outside a bar

644
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,500
and they're like oh man that's really
cool what about this what about that how

645
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,020
does

646
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,130
like is anonymous gonna hack my car you
know

647
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,990
but you getting that even the size a
random anonymous de pelos at a bar in

648
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,960
London we're getting some really

649
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,910
heavy-hitting email from some movers and
shakers outside the InfoSec

650
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:45,130
inside but various industries in the
medical field the automotive field were

651
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,490
coming to us and say

652
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,000
hey I wanna learn more about your
organization what it is you're trying to

653
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,670
do

654
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,599
%uh we're very interested in this tell
us more yes I will cover those in a bit

655
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,079
but its

656
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,500
is surprising to me that they're coming
to us at this point

657
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,510
I mean we're year and we're now starting
to get these emails

658
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,560
from these organizations and these
people bettors telling

659
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,070
they're coming to us and saying please
tell us more about you

660
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:15,380
it's very very were satisfying to see
that happen

661
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,170
isn't a good slice number we admit our
embarrassing what's worse than last

662
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,829
well the words things we need to improve
on yeah

663
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:27,720
um building slides clearly that didn't
work very well for us

664
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,150
%uh are really brought initial scope we
found pretty quickly that that was

665
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:36,579
a too broad to dear all over the map if
you remember the Congress last year we

666
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:38,339
were covering everything from

667
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:42,670
and he had under slide earlier not just
whose body mind and soul

668
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,730
it was legislation enacted the we want
to cover

669
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,420
all these other activities that were
just who do which is this too much we

670
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,210
could do it

671
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:54,300
and so as are you remember the slide to
slide ago her finding the message

672
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,890
I mean it's getting narrower and
narrower and more focused and we're now

673
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,900
into

674
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,150
a are pillars ok medical automotive

675
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,170
human liver human life and public safety

676
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:09,020
and other and public infrastructure home
thank you

677
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,500
not clearly what works less well as
learning airlines

678
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,730
I'm we also have had some pretty bad
project management a.m.

679
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,230
as space mentioned early on raw
volunteers a test

680
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,790
things get dropped you know we don't
have a somebody who's sitting around

681
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,070
making sure that everything is on time
on task

682
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,339
so if you send us an email you never
heard back send another email came out

683
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:32,119
here are you either so yeah

684
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,000
mister that's true that's why still
lifestyle here

685
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,070
yeah I times but

686
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:44,839
but yet you know really want to change
things we want to do good

687
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:49,099
sometimes we're not a as good at
planning and executing on that as we

688
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:50,180
would like to be

689
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:55,349
but we hope to improve that next year we
had really really poor communication

690
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:58,810
just we're having a a a talk about this
earlier today

691
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,310
about how badly we have communicated
even just with then

692
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,240
you know five or ten people who have
been running around doing different

693
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,130
things

694
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,950
um you know we say it takes a guild and
we know that we need to be doing these

695
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,700
things

696
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,089
but coordinating with each other
communicating and then

697
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:16,990
being able to get that message out and
he is far from the case because we have

698
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,980
to recognize that we are taking steps
are ready to approve that

699
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,440
arm for those you there following on the
mailing list that we have on Gmail we

700
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,210
now have a

701
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,180
a monthly email because I'll the telling
activities that we've been doing the

702
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,200
last month

703
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,329
oMG we're updating the website we're
working on the website

704
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:35,119
we have issues there right now but we're
hoping to have the newsletter posted

705
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,400
there as well

706
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,510
so the people who are trying to figure
out what did you guys been doing

707
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,589
I can either go to the mailing list or
the website say all you guys that this

708
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:43,470
this nest

709
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,609
as opposed to thinking that we're not
doing anything when in fact we're going

710
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:47,750
to work our ass off

711
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,109
right yeah and when it comes to from
doing things verses

712
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:54,940
talking about what we've been doing
which kinda tried to err on the side of

713
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,380
doing more things and talking to more
people

714
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,800
a who can you can have the influence we
need

715
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,470
um unfortunately the the communication
Boyd was

716
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,099
filled over the last year with just some
bad information

717
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:11,210
time people who would come up to us a
conferences and say

718
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,010
I really hate political action committee
that you guys are doing sick or not

719
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,109
doing one of those so is there cover
yeah where

720
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:22,160
how did you hear that but a will get
better

721
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,440
on thanks for coming and listening to
what we're talking about now

722
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,020
this is already a former better
communication hopefully it's better

723
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,260
on we had some early trials a

724
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,640
that we just decided not to go down that
route right um

725
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,670
we had talked at one point about maybe
setting up a lobbying organization

726
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,130
really really quickly scratched out on
just didn't make sense

727
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,240
we already mentioned the two ideas that
we dropped a

728
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,560
up criminalization of security research
in civil liberties

729
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,720
turns out people are arguing really good
things in those areas

730
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,450
we would kinda just be getting in their
way they know me way more about

731
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,320
changing the laws than we do we don't
even know the problem spaces

732
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,349
the legal system the way that they do
now that we have a defined mission

733
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:08,750
statement they fall outside of our
mission

734
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,819
radio and a name we are to mention the
name

735
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:16,410
we won't rehash that in

736
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,640
surprises very mention a bunch this
prize is that we had this year

737
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,300
up in the interest to tie my way simply
the entire year

738
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,609
yeah he was a entire surprised %uh
everything

739
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:31,319
was just surprising um surprising was we
had a lot of success really quickly we

740
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:32,380
had a lot of people

741
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,010
jumping on board page pulling a center
discussions where

742
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,910
you know we didn't think that we had any
friends or anywhere in us I'm

743
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,599
how surprised it we had a water hits
from

744
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,569
like Danish and Norwegian

745
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:51,400
weblinks yes we do it a Danish TV news

746
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,630
segment Danish radio show around and
radio show like

747
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,079
where is it I don't understand that but
hey that's rising getting the message

748
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,280
out the house

749
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,089
I went over and I did talk at 44 Khan in
London just two weeks ago

750
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:07,579
and the feedback and amount of people
who are supportive of the idea

751
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:11,569
was huge almost wish we had launched in
the UK first because there is the

752
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,180
reception was so universally positive

753
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,810
people are coming up grammy hey I really
want to talk to you about that thing

754
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,880
it's on a great

755
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,329
um I think that our

756
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:24,310
you know another thing that was a
surprise to me is that there are T a lot

757
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,099
of people as

758
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:28,150
space sorry mention doing really good
things whether they're in the

759
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,680
manufactures themselves or researchers
were associated with it

760
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,250
or you know nonprofit think tank
organizations

761
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:39,160
on there's a lot of people who are
looking into some of these issues

762
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,240
a who are happy to have somebody else
doing it and you

763
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,800
who want to partner up and work together
um

764
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,960
where the other things last thing I want
to say is up

765
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,250
we found that we really been invited to
help influence things

766
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:56,780
that was a surprise we already have the
permission to go and do this

767
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,200
I think that we have given ourselves the
permission necessarily

768
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,069
they were a little bit afraid because I
don't know about you but most my career

769
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:05,810
in InfoSec has been spent

770
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,310
but in my head against the wall and not
getting any progress not being able to

771
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,569
influence the channa commanded a company

772
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:14,859
on all the sudden being passed in

773
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:20,470
to help influence it takes a mine shaft

774
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:24,140
so what's the next your gonna look like
um if I can

775
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,450
Plano stirred on this for a minute on
and this will all probably be wrong

776
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:27,910
because

777
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,950
or predictions turnout different than
you expect but

778
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,609
up better communication and transparency
we already talked about that

779
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:37,319
were already making steps to make the
better we are here we are and if you

780
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:38,430
have an idea

781
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,790
hey you guys should do this we've talked
about doing a podcast re

782
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:45,260
doing a newsletter that maybe even like

783
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,430
I don't know some other ideas just

784
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:52,109
throws at us if there's some way you
want to get more information

785
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:56,040
we want to make it happen we do have
that again I'll mention it again as a

786
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,800
man less on

787
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,420
on Gmail you can find it on our website
link to it and that's open everybody if

788
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,290
you have a comment or whatever you want
to share you have an idea

789
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:08,170
feel free to post it there will see it
and not and an act on it yes

790
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,800
absolutely on wanna have a much broader
international reach

791
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,800
so I mention that I went over to London
to I give a talk there

792
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,069
we've had some other events going on in
Europe um

793
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:23,260
there's an event later on this year in
India that I think somebody might go in

794
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,450
do talk I'm on some these areas

795
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,640
we want to get the word out this is not
a US problem

796
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,280
this is a global problem now people all
over the world are feeling that

797
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,099
the Pench I'm and on us a lot of parts

798
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:41,760
that go into the medical devices the
cars are made in different places

799
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,630
%um car certainly your YouTube Germany a
brazil has a lot of those things

800
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:49,920
medical devices certainly asia with all
the little chips didn't think they could

801
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,599
nothing made in the US and now

802
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,230
perceived that way Miller software is
written in India your hardware is

803
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,800
manufactured in China

804
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,010
%uh so there's definitely a global issue
and so we need a bigger international

805
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:01,589
footprint

806
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:05,079
yes we want to be able to give more self

807
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:08,319
service content to people who want it

808
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,630
on and to be able to facilitate support
to the people were doing things we

809
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,270
talked about the idea of building a
research library

810
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,810
which would be you know maybe it's wiki
year maybe it somewhere else

811
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,849
but the idea is to collect researched
happened before so that when somebody

812
00:44:22,849 --> 00:44:24,770
wants to go out to research something

813
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:29,190
they don't have to re learn how to
reverse engineer sir

814
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,599
protocol it or even done they can just
go and pick that up they can spend more

815
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:35,560
time doing the things that really matter

816
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,839
um we talked a little bit about the

817
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:41,970
the summit weeded out and Las Vegas

818
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,040
wish the the researchers and the people
in industry we want him or those

819
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,430
us so we have a call to do 1 summit

820
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:52,630
her industry vertical that we started
per year

821
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:57,079
as well as 14 on the security community
ourselves

822
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:00,859
so get a buncha researchers together
with people in

823
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:04,819
the affected industry and have them to
sit down for a couple days

824
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:08,710
over those couple days talk about the
issues come to some conclusion.

825
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,990
and hopefully produce some kinda a draft
document

826
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:16,790
out a couple days a sessions they can
then be used to internally externally

827
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:21,040
whatever and then the one for the
security industry security community

828
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,410
would be when people come to ask us
advice we want to be able to give them

829
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,730
good advice

830
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:29,980
on at is there anybody here who wants to
install antivirus in the car

831
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,000
not me right so

832
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,310
that's the that's the answer that you
would give ish you're talking somebody

833
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,119
got their PC right pavelic

834
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:41,230
computers running slow I think I have a
virus what I do

835
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:44,510
put antivirus on their own good idea how
to do that right

836
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,520
may be taught people in this room might
not give that advice but

837
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,520
that's the advice that you guessed right
so we need to be able to give better

838
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,310
advice we need to think about these
things in a different way

839
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,740
when you transpose security

840
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,849
in the typical security mind set on the
summit these devices

841
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:03,430
became the two worse consequences the no
security

842
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:07,579
if you're in a hospital and a doctor
needs to get to others to do it

843
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:11,460
defibrillators to restart the heart you
don't want them to have a long complex

844
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,609
password before they can use the
deferred earlier

845
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:16,599
right because what's gonna happen you
can forget it gonna have to call the

846
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:17,560
support desk

847
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,440
hey I forgot my password to reset it on
this disability like that stupid why

848
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,640
would anyone do that

849
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,040
you what that thing to work when you
needed right so

850
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,190
how do we come up with those ideas and
then

851
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:33,170
but the the big one a lot of people's
mind is having a formal organization

852
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:33,970
entity

853
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:38,060
so far we've gotten by with just a
mailing list in a website

854
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,260
and that's worked pretty well up but we
do recognize that if we want to engage

855
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,390
in certain conversations if you want to
be able to do certain tasks and

856
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:47,260
activities

857
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,770
we do need some cuddle the organization
legal entity

858
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:57,200
we're leaning towards a on 501 c3
non-profit educational foundation

859
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,560
I and we're either going to file our own

860
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,700
more um were in conversations with a
couple organizations right now

861
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,940
where they might adopt our mission and
then give us some the infrastructure

862
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,430
that we need to be able to

863
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:17,130
to go out to be more effective in

864
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,270
so I don't talk to this likely got like
seven minutes

865
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,440
for gotta get out here I'm but of the
screen yeah

866
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,550
because of the screen we got a lot of
things coming up but

867
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,770
to that I'd through that I do want to
talk about really quickly

868
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:34,630
the Society of Automotive Engineers
anybody know who that is

869
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:39,230
she does on told you yes so Society of
Automotive Engineers

870
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,200
is spent organization spin around it's
essentially a professional society for

871
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,569
people who build

872
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:48,540
automotive things cars planes trains to
go to your dealer and they have those

873
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,089
certificates on Wallace ASE certified

874
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:54,300
dots who's doing a certain occasion
right some

875
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:58,160
we had some good conversations with them
the other day we briefed

876
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,619
why they're working group on the
five-star safety framework

877
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:07,920
and they invited us to join the group to
participate to have a seat at the table

878
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,630
I'm so I think that's huge and that's

879
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:15,210
some definitely something that that
we're gonna take them up on

880
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:19,170
to be able to get into that level is an
organization which

881
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:23,069
has so much influence in the auto
industry that they said

882
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:26,280
a lot of the policies um and a lot of
the

883
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,599
standards for how did you cars safely

884
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,910
prime um we gotta FDA workshop coming up

885
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:37,569
that the its on servers curative medical
devices

886
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:41,050
and FDA is why the organization to you
know they

887
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,339
day have kind of had cyber land in their
laps

888
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,119
they don't really know what to do with
it so they're looking around for help

889
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:47,960
for allies

890
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,349
that's a I believe that an open meeting
and it's a

891
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:54,890
at the end of this month the 21st and
22nd something like that

892
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,869
sure the DC area and you really want to
contribute you can go in and sign up for

893
00:48:58,869 --> 00:48:59,440
it

894
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,970
on if they got any spots available and
then I C squared congress

895
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:08,490
we're giving the keynote there and the
idea is to mobilize

896
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:12,270
their 100 and something thousand-strong
membership

897
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:15,420
to care about things that are a little
bit more consequential

898
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,619
right to shift from assets they're
replaceable

899
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:22,790
assets that are irreplaceable

900
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,730
I so the five-star automotive cyber
safety framework in a real already heard

901
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,440
about this

902
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,589
one way or another just heard about it
good at the half doesn't look good

903
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:35,550
%uh in the interest of time I'm not
gonna go through this but you can

904
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:39,990
read basically all this on our website I
am was linked site

905
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,319
gotta Billy link to the petition but
emphasized yeah

906
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:46,140
the %uh basically I don't want to we
should probably say where it is for

907
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:47,400
those people who don't know what it is

908
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,240
yeah a so the five-star auto safety
framework we published an open letter to

909
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,260
the automotive industry I essentially
calling for them to work with us

910
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:02,069
as we work with them where arse a Spears
expertise overlap

911
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:06,369
we should probably collaborate right on

912
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:09,390
we also publish the this

913
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:12,450
which is five star safety framework

914
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:15,579
that's essentially capabilities for how
you go about

915
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,930
making sure that the automobile is safe
right

916
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,099
it's nothing crazy the rightness basic
common sense stuff

917
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:25,500
well anything with a good conscience
it's not prescriptive

918
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,720
it's not a checklist its capabilities
that make things safer

919
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,510
I don't care how you implement these
things on in fact I know a lotta

920
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:36,000
manufactures already done

921
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,500
two or three of these things they just
aren't talking about it

922
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,420
so opening up a little bit more and
having that dialogue some

923
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:47,710
it was not created in a vacuum it was
about nine months of work

924
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:51,559
to put together the ideas and the
concepts that went into this document

925
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:55,670
a we talked courses security junction
with somebody outta my crush

926
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:59,430
yeah we talked a lot of security
researchers many of whom do work

927
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:03,540
in the auto industry on we talked with
Automotive Engineers like

928
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,920
the jet you know SAE members to I can

929
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,200
they're kinda cool security but their
first and foremost like

930
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,440
I need a wrench in my hand I just feel
naked on

931
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,630
policymakers who really liked the idea
and give us some good feedback

932
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,890
I in fact we've got a quote from senator
Franken was it

933
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:25,490
a who said that it was really important
to be considering these things

934
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,770
um we talked with insurance and I'll

935
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:33,589
analysts I who are looking at this from
the perspective hey we are to ensure

936
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:34,819
cars

937
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:39,680
their computers and cars does that mean
word the cyber insurance business now

938
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,910
and the reinsurers to people who ensure
the insurers but they're in the same

939
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:43,400
boat

940
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,829
they don't really know what to do they
need some guidance

941
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:50,440
on talk to accident investigators the
people who go out and look at

942
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,520
crash scenes figure out why things
happened

943
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,349
um they need certain tools to be able to
do their jobs better

944
00:51:57,349 --> 00:52:02,450
if they can't see the trail of evidence
because it was lost to the digital ether

945
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,960
then how are they gonna tell what
happened and are all these groups had

946
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,030
some sort and put into developing this
letter does so we publish

947
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:13,339
right I think wanna chris is a big old
even asking the automaker's right we

948
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,630
actually did

949
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:17,950
yeah they're all quite heavily in in
developing this yeah it's funny to hear

950
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:18,950
some other people

951
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,430
a in in the press who basically said

952
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:27,579
um you didn't ask me site well we didn't
know we had to ask you sorry

953
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:31,099
give us a call next time on and that is
all the time got

954
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:35,380

972
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:43,059

973
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:43,690
stuff

974

need to get on TV in there like and did
get their message gets more people

975
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:50,980
because they don't know how to speak to
it to the camera I'll

976
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,420
take advantage of this if you can
