so are get started

8
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,300
chairman's role I do not give me names
presentation

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,070
you can attribute it you cannot say who
are you truth about you can talk about

10
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:03,460
it

11
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,640
you can see you said it so next up

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,010
trigger warnings this is a talk about
human trafficking I will be talking

13
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,049
about kidnapping assault rape

14
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,439
da contents and we going to lie to a
person there may or may not be unity

15
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,280
Sophia problems leave now we will hold
it against you

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,280
I can guarantee was gonna have relied on
his life

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,340
miss live on the Internet ship I will be
the selection

18
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,060
arm so he does not mean unity

19
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,549
says I don't have any that I with a box
so project history

20
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:37,720
this story is leaking else's project in
college

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,869
arm basically the professor said find
something they can stick with for 15

22
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:42,520
weeks

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,380
do much research on to link analysis
using

24
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,200
intelligence tools to figaro how things
are linked together

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,670
are last year a laptop is stolen

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,950
had the original data on it had the
original materials on it

27
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,000
this is the replacement laptop Louis
story yet

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
arm serve a program called

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,640
I to tell Ellis notebooks me by IBM it's
what

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,739
law enforcement and more specifically
the federal government uses in the

31
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:11,840
military aspects

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,860
arm their supervisors for the class one
was

33
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,920
a intelligent for the US Air Force's he
taught this offer site

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,819
the percent of the the recitals actually
I agent so

35
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,959
pick a topic and stick with it for 15
weeks later we'll stick with

36
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,379
so I chose human trafficking before you
started

37
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,870
what's people's concepts of human
trafficking anybody

38
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,870
no

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,730
so that the I asked with that what your
conduct was

40
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,319
Angie she took the smuggler approach she
said moving people from one region to

41
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:52,879
another one

42
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,150
it's not according to departmental that
Homeland Security

43
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,670
larger all tax hard to read this perk up
with

44
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,110
three sections smaller version easier to
read

45
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,870
came from the Michigan State Police
human trafficking to serve recruiting

46
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,519
harboring transporting providing or
obtaining a person

47
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,989
for compelled labor or commercial sex
acts and its dark country force

48
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,890
fraud coercion now la people think
smuggling is human trafficking

49
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,220
that's an aspect of it sometimes more
times than

50
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,420
more times than not it's not all and
that's one thing that allow people to

51
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,989
understand and they realize after those
talks like

52
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,739
Real Talk smuggling all the way it works

53
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,170
basically if you're under 18 and your
prostitute

54
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,940
it's automatically cancer human
trafficking because you have no fear of

55
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,140
the point have no choice

56
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,129
there's with some use force you into it
if you're a prosecutor Pam

57
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:50,299
more likely that's going to be a case of
human trafficking the really best short

58
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:52,769
answer C is clean the floors project if
you're drafting

59
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,110
it is modern-day slavery so

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,360
the other case from Ohio from last

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,560
his last year at all three girls are
kidnapped that doesn't count as human

62
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,670
trafficking because he wasn't making
money off

63
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,379
there is no money aspect to it he
connect those people recapping change

64
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,069
color how

65
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:13,640
his house because he wasn't doing
financial gains of its

66
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,570
its kidnapping not trafficking so

67
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,680
human trafficking is roughly $32 billion
dollars a year that's a rough estimate

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,150
its

69
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,940
this is a lesson i've seen in several
places two players project Department of

70
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,820
Homeland Security

71
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,270
now could be a case of a great excuse
repeating the same stuff arm

72
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,729
2013 yes it was urs twenty point nine
million people be in traffic in

73
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,979
that works out to your price: the
present a single person on the screen

74
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,120
as 1,531 hours that it

75
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,680
so if you got fifty nine dollars way
around go by somebody

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,750
now that's also the pair up our where
you're at the world

77
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,770
there's bars the world where you can buy
Sony fertile 6 box

78
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,820
but trafficking US a really old wats

79
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,110
its immigrant secular no it's not just
rinse it is people are born here

80
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,949
the rough estimate is between a hundred
thousand euro 2000

81
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,060
now you there's no way know we actually
go out and

82
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,259
look at the market see how the market
works but

83
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,509
base on the statistic analysis that
other people have done they say this is

84
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:17,710
the number

85
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,880
arm mission is to please use this number
as well as a partner in home & Security

86
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,100
I seen this number as high as 300,000

87
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,620
so its it's a moving number but people
here are born into it

88
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,220
is not just a case of or systemic a
small mercies

89
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,880
Rs arts projects like I said as we can.
else's product a couple questions my

90
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,919
first question is

91
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,990
whatever trafficking is most relevant
you know

92
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,160
racers ago traffic response between
people back and forth and say

93
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,860
misconception

94
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,750
are very same question was how's it
differ today from the eighteen hundreds

95
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,759
and last question was can I use open
source intelligence to actually do

96
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,789
anything about it

97
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:05,000
so I did has a rolls I want a sale jail

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,340
arm basically rule on stay off the radar

99
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,729
real to you don't tell people without
proof in this case I looked at 15 weeks

100
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:14,509
attract no data from the Department of
Homeland Security

101
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,410
and bass all that of this this
informations about 18 months or at this

102
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,639
point

103
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,960
cuz I change classes will darling have
had to go back to do it where r do it

104
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,660
as particles changing OMG I have gone to
that sonya

105
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,840
are real 304 questionable sites
including the darknet

106
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,479
this goes back to rule on I don't get
arrested not for college project

107
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,860
arm they've over the dark net because

108
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,340
they didn't meet my scuba call my goal
was crazy open source intelligence tools

109
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,229
to get ahead on the part where the
selling it and try to track try to

110
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:47,919
attack the part where they're actually

111
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,680
during recruitment arm and lastly I have
skills but they are people are way

112
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,270
better than I ever said about the screen
Pardesi

113
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:00,800
I use tools tales it or read for my
first go two choices

114
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,490
you know I know who there's a will
there's an hour to move around

115
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:11,490
now downside to this all

116
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:21,250
put the picture or

117
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,380
army you can see there's a real fast

118
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:31,380
Craigslist now blocking torex

119
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,130
notes so I can continue doing this
through to

120
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,600
do toward the start which means I have
to do it the other ways

121
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,039
arm but they're basically says the IP
address using has been automatically

122
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,990
blocked

123
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,090
and act as your contact list and he
knows that contact number

124
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:53,960
ignored all I capturing am's invest up
wiki

125
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,590
those are you haven't seen it is a lace
low I'm his crew where he will hey

126
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,010
the second I started doing this is it.
software think naughty go without

127
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,850
transforms

128
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,160
and better graphics in various

129
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,860
for UK some forties got the land and in
case file for timely

130
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,010
arm say to use a weapon rumored

131
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,229
DHS ice who do you think is the lead
agency

132
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:23,729
in the United States for for human
trafficking no gases

133
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,849
la people think it's the FBI Department
of Homeland Security actually has some

134
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,979
her cases to the FBI's water cases

135
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,260
so lee ABC is actually Department of
Homeland Security

136
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,820
for looking air nationally it would be
the State Department arm

137
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,200
Facebook rate was Twitter the back page
so this is

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,709
them and it's just a all week he is a
slings as a text file

139
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:51,410
we invariably to file ever never you
upload a picture to it puts in a folder

140
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,470
the special tool it's less use is a good
way to

141
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,680
take everything put together until you
actually loaded into your tools

142
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,380
arm I got me information like aside from
the 24

143
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,290
Department of Homeland Security listener
email update every week to brag about

144
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,350
how great they are

145
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,410
and look at we did we broke up this
traffic during that we did you forget

146
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:10,990
this on

147
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,339
ok here's a prosecution going on this
one and I bet is a psychological thing a

148
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,230
passionate political and security

149
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,010
the stock I'm not I do question their
ops sec choices

150
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,070
by things that are a great job so don't
take this as I'm bashing law enforcement

151
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,970
because this article

152
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,140
social media army if you can see it says
on the bottle a scream

153
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,270
he promised me the world so what I want
to do is I want to get ahead of the

154
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,589
point where the people are being sold

155

new looks looks for first

156
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,589
101st at the initial currencies

157
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:46,040
to ensure that argument still happen in
person arm

158
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,839
the social engineering techniques ago of
people malls say

I can make a better become coming up all
there's another case I came across last

162
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:57,910
year

163
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,540
pressure earlier this year where it's
not just that

164
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,470
and I'll talk about that if US is an
interesting case and ties back to where

165
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,730
this project going forward

166
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:12,430
arm Facebook believe the account open
until after the gym the cases are gone

167
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,529
already trial

168
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,850
at which point the close it how
completely import of

169
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,350
so if you've been arrested for
trafficking in your your site still up

170
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,790
there

171
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,529
and if you get the another earlier
loving as you go through and scrape the

172
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,730
person's friends list

173
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,110
arm in one case that will see a second
actually did that Maria

174
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,190
his friends with errors like forty guys
50 girls

175
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,800
and the All Whites Wet Seal so it's like
okay

176
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,220
was yours a clothing brand its really

177
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,430
gaudy clothing if you ask me to step up
a stripper wear

178
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,110
arm local mall

179
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,490
the took beijing's asylum back to what
silhouette sex and it's a case of

180
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,610
its interesting just

181
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,640
the see that they like this particular
cloud because when we talk

182
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,770
get into a link to start talking to
people with

183
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,570
myspace alleviate how open was locked so
I found older

184
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,820
MySpace pages which I was able to go
like read up on the person we came from

185
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,329
the home

186
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:14,110
you can go into the subfolders you can
you can see the help you can't really do

187
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,760
much with it

188
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,029
Craigslist they start removing things
from there's quickly as possible

189
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:21,829
is made it really hard if you know
scraping the site automatically every

190
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:22,560
five minutes

191
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,990
there's a lot you miss because people
flag immediately are back page

192
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,220
is still great place to go and see
people trying to pick me up

193
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,790
they're starting a better the community
like the starting your Craigslist way

194
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,600
with the community was not quite there
yet

195
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,020
Twitter there's no public policy when I
looked

196
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,400
I don't know if this change in last 18
months arm

197
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,660
angles a massive explain why a second so
analysis

198
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,370
I know it's really hard to see this is
not ego missus

199
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,020
just a sub so that it I rebuilt partly I
can rebuild the entire project

207
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,470
prostituting on underage girls we'd meet
up for Facebook

208
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,910

yo given a choice for you for sex
against his prostitution and sex tourism

224
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:25,329
befalto human trafficking has earned a
routine

225
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:32,329
arm

226
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:39,010
sorry news release are trying to find a
while to actually I'm here

227
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,290
my favorite case was will talk about a
minute is operation poker chip

228
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,240
explain why it's called that Amanda Knox
play let's make your case

229
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,829
arm but basically this is the link
analysis so I went through in took

230
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,980
everything from the articles lined up
with the victim was

231
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,510
to hulas hat 22 the perpetrator was

232
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:03,130
the judges on the case the agent in
charge of the case

233
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,380
so the head of the headed the branch is
running the show

234
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,920
and the prosecutors tied to the case is
not always the

235
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,140
district attorney at some is usually a
junior member the Attorney Seth

236
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,800
but they tell you who it is and that's
where it all into an issue with how

237
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,430
they're doing the operations security

238
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:23,400
for for law enforcement on the DHS site
there tell you who to a compromise to

239
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,310
tell you what charges to go

240
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,390
and threatened to tell you what yo the
nation charges and going to be the guy

241
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,540
that goes out and says

242
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,970
in does a does the rates and as people
are you pics people go out there

243
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,689
so I won't compromise is case like I do
is bring up it bring him into question

244
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:44,430
and show question why to resign him I
got the prosecutors during the case

245
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,839
well these people we can find
information online

246
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,209

accept late work complain about that

249
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,760
side of it

250
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,410
ir said why they do it they're trying to
say look it would look at the good work

251
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,100
we're doing

252
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,579
is that people are doing it they've also
done issue

253
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,660

254
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,689
well this person got a recognition for

255
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:16,569
we would have a picture the person would
have a name recognition for the work is

256
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:19,860
done on the human trafficking case this
location

257
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,740

that but they'll fall trafficking cuz

352

you saying hey come clean my house

353

354
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:00,910

deal the ones are labor whatever

356
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,590

you know come Martin make it for me and
I'll be five thousand dollars in

359
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,840
there's more to it than that Augusta
Craigslist warm

360
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,330
we're sorry the IP address blocks arm

361
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,000
this paper from Backpage basically this
is not how to blah blah blah

362
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,690
them back to the ghetto arm

363
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,789
so I was a good or better demo but we
are running out I really time is left

364
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:38,299
heroes question is: is beginning what a
surprise when

365
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:43,179
prostitution now I have any answers here
the state I live in New

366
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:47,440
it's not prostitution is labor there's
more cases of labor trafficking

367
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,700
there are prostitution so

368
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,440
mission lights prostitution rights
prostitution but you'll find out liars

369
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,400
were its other cases arm like a set six
crew

370
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,600
sixty percent labor forty percent
prostitution

371
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,950
how does it differ from the day this yr
old hearst organ trafficking

372
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,520
we call it slavery you know the they say
the civil wars fought over it that's not

373
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,660
quite true but

374
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,480
its part slavery became hard or are
today that relies on drug addiction

375
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,010
abuse threats

376
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:20,280
but mostly lack a public awareness
people think it's United States it

377
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,950
doesn't happen here

378
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,090
arm the net for this project going is
moving from

379
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,419
glickenhaus a site to a problem public
awareness project

380
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:32,929
they're trying to pass laws in the state
I live in where

381
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,330
the mic trafficking better right now the
state's list is won the

382
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,570
worse 5 for trafficking laws the snow
victim Protection

383
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,330
the people's enjoyment are being asked
possibly was a similar problem

384
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,809
are you guys cream laws lick for prom it
doesn't exist

385
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:53,299
aren't open source intelligence tools be
used to combat trafficking

386
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:56,549
are as possible he told me

387
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:59,870
but you tell me i think is possible

388
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:04,210
I know it's getting harder attack bias
on this could have done it before

389
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,789
but the site again harder to use is
getting harder to find the information

390
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,539
on the sites

391
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:13,640
some people are moving to dark web but
the majority was moving back towards

392
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,919
what I want your action online offline

393
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,059
in the malls the school's are the one
they want to talk about real fast

394
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,360
there's a case of Michigan recently

395
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,000
11-year-old girl so the age of traffic
is going to 11-year-old girl

396
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,250
she got sign up for this site as I I
don't understand all the details to it

397
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,720
basically repairs Potter EI iPod

398
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,390
that you text message from you and I
messenger there's a site that

399
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,750
teams were tied up to the like I'm doing
homework and the City Hall

400
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,140

the sucking text messages from this

401
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,070

school on well a lot about the whole our

403
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,429
problems

404
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,900
other well the also so tragically our
parents sometimes she wouldn't

405
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,400
this person the skit from florida
measures like

406
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,620
trying two girls from from Michigan come
down to Florida

407
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,440
the party at disney world those are
saying hey you know I can you pick

408
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,510
passports we can go to

409
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,080
with your mascot really party it up
liquid teenagers do you

410
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,940
and shit she didn't tell her parents her
mom's a social worker she didn't tell

411
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,130
her parents

412
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,130
and so she started making pictures of
girls early age

413
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,500
in mexico made look older

414
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,870
now this is a case of what's happening
in the United States is happening in

415
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,940
Michigan

416
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,990
well the affluent areas of Michigan all

417
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,360
just outside university admission and

418
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,090
it's a case of the police are saying but
this doesn't happen here

419
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,440
our way they talk to you but this
doesn't happen here so

420
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,540
that's why did they say this needs to be
more about public awareness it does

421
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,200
little sis

422
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,440

for the next talk

424
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:59,230

425
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:03,290
