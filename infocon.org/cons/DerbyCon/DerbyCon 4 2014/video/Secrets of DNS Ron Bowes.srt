1
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:21,789
up

2
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:27,390
yep

3
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,390
alright

4
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,100
I think a radio cool alright so thank
you guys for coming

5
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,680
um Sr on the way here now yeah

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,040
I just don't have a five minutes ago I
walked here and street

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,270
asiana choir preaching from the Bible or
whatever my goals to be better than that

8
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,560
so them should be hard exactly

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,890
a cover place I never happens re: so

10
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,920
I me decide when go was cool

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,949
is not recall any more but is also quite
aside so

12
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,119
sooo I really wrote this talk in a very
primitive forms herbicides kaback

13
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:14,320
about six months ago will they be here
at beat expectations

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,920
perfect agree the jokes re:

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,479
so also a quick story just two

16
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,439
no break the ice so I i I guess I did it
the Socrates has come back

17
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,399
Proform and I do live in California
working a goal for the past year so

18
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:33,710
and in california there's no rain it
doesn't mean they're ever and

19
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,130
and to look pose a bad thing but I love
it the problem is

20
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,840
I want to go back to stalk bring a
jacket that will occur to me something

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,340
about a mile from the conference venue

22
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,289
I have no jackie is pouring rain so end
up doing my talk soaking wet

23
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:50,590
where finding a whole talk soaking wet
so

24
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,460
house hard mode today easy mode and also
be has come back was on French except my

25
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,049
cock

26
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,770
so a I'm national sure anybody actually
in New whilst talking about anyway

27
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,130
in from good RH

28
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,590
buddhism a propeller on BOS J

29
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,510
not you know I agree six French and
that's about it is a translation of

30
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,830
I'm in ask is a poorly lit

31
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,970
and that is it alright so

32
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,380
you on your side I'm here to talk to my
own tools I wrote my own time

33
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,250
I work at Google they have nothing to do
with this I have even shown the talk yet

34
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,360
Commission afterwards

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,010
when they can say no

36
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,400
book is your wash craft a

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,670
up but seriously

38
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,330
the reason that cool encourage us to
these presentations at auction stuff

39
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,460
we are recruiting we good people we only
two people

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,050
and it's really hard to find so if
you're ever interested in

41
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,370
in the Java Google pursuing a job come
find me I got back to business cards

42
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,740
summer CI that's that so when you talk
about today

43
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,700
on the talk about how to use DNS in
contesting basically

44
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,590
everything to talk about will be you
know how to use DNS in the way with

45
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,500
designed to be used

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,010
in a sense that is and he's not roll
call the way it was written

47
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,870
not taking advantage of bonneville these
are certain version A bashary

48
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,490
re: bash still stuck on dash certain
version a binary think this is a general

49
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,380
protocol

50
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,600
specific stuff so nothing a poisoning

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,570
discolorations seige just beyond the
scope so

52
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,900
a quick crash course on how the s-works
I will be most you know this to some

53
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,790
extent already but

54
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,060
over anyway so occurs against request

55
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,310
starts with somebody sitting at the
computer typing at me you know

56
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,400
having something into your browser in
this case were using as an example

57
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
so they can test this cause a collapse
at work schools like has been my

58
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,650
coming its legal director probably

59
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,460
and writers is a is a cached no if it's
not cached

60
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,870
send it on to the writers the answer for
soaking that's maybe

61
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,100
you know for example a a Google server
where is configured

62
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,200
it may cause your eyes P server doesn't
matter someone's gonna go to root

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,780
servers

64
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,150
and losers are the same thing is a
cached Yes No

65
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,170
if it's not cached go to store his
server

66
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,180
which happens you mine the 30th server
now

67
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,460
guest requests and back with everyone's
so

68
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,509
what's interesting is that the end user
the person having request

69
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:29,639
never actually sent me a packet a pack
and everyone from

70
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,949
the victim machine to my machine in any
directions

71
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,090
um yeah

72
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,139
about more but after such a very good
reaction to what matters

73
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,300
there's a lot of other stuff mall but it
doesn't matter for this so

74
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,789
their lost pets requests there's no

75
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:51,050
someone to hear bill talk about couple
them and a request

76
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,659
get IP address you send a request for
Google com

77
00:04:54,659 --> 00:05:00,330
you get back King in this example five
appearances a quadruple a request

78
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,900
getting the ipv6 address MX gets the
mail records

79
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,319
the wondrous the all-male records and
other records that these are text

80
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,199
is not just for my IP address or 16
whatever bye ipv6 address

81
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,740
it's actually text which is useful to us
will see why

82
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,219
for obvious reasons there's a CNAME TXT
records

83
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,029
and be the past me

84
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:27,409
I see name much again X records are text
which is nice

85
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:32,169
TXT records are designed for text
basically is a chunk up to justify bites

86
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,409
archery gotta in those using Windows
libraries in which case you can have

87
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,509
males

88
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,979
for some reason knows a and when
troubleshooting

89
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:44,699
which we think we have some sort at
school

90
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,849
so straight from RC 10:35 this is what

91
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:51,150
DTS package looks like it's got ninety
value and then

92
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,560
a method to what looks like a dick up
much you devalue

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
your desire and the value that changes
request and

94
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,090
is basically used to know when you get a
response for which request

95
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,659
you a sickness Butler the opcode

96
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:09,229
can be Querrey or couple things was
wearing a crease

97
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:12,620
the flags we got 85 flex

98
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,529
is that you are left there and there's a
a TCR dere

99
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:19,879
secure means to curry as opposed to
response

100
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,889
ABC 13 ish she seems truncated

101
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,889
Rd in Aria recursion desired allowed
whatever

102
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:32,039
return code thing questions/answers
nature's

103
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,090
authorities additional sir

104
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,569
lab so thats

105
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:42,090
that's awful yes package in a nutshell
the four things Obama

106
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,449
are a sub for Michael resource records

107
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,669
I reasons record looks like this so any
record

108
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:53,069
equitably record an annex and an ass MX
txt

109
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:57,089
are all in this format roughly so the
all-star with a name

110
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:01,740
which can be the motherland um the type
to class time to live

111
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,569
and then the length and that he'll and
the data is going be different depending

112
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:06,229
on which

113
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:09,650
these US states arises I'll have more
info cost of

114
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,909
so you to invest

115
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:16,610
so have been aside record compression

116
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,740
I mention how the answers have a name if
you have like five

117
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,949
ipv4 responses like actual unit redesign
its gonna have the same the repeated

118
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:25,800
five times

119
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,639
United and it isn't and you know million
years ago

120
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,729
when when Brown Band with was actually

121
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,529
mattered to the extent so with unity
with the men's compression scheme

122
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,449
where the name starts the 21 bitch so c0
typically

123
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:44,569
it means the name stored elsewhere in
the packet

124
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,689
so please look at this Austin package so
c0 0f means

125
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:53,379
please like 15 bites into the from
starter pack it and that's a name is

126
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:57,379
now often times and you can also be a
pointer so you have c0 0f

127
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:01,069
and then at and shifting your scissors
US you know if the loop

128
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:05,159
and that's happen in the lobby this
libraries and that for example had a

129
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,559
an issue that initially so

130
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:12,150
get your sys-con so

131
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,189
years BC knowing me now

132
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:20,069
close this ago

133
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:23,610
appear to reverse DNS works basin exact
same way

134
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,749
the only difference is use the record
have a PCR as opposed to an x-ray or

135
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:28,509
whatever

136
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,140
and from SAP address as busy backwards

137
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,159
sitting at 7:04 125 220 6.5 University
5226

138
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,490
she's to the way it works

139
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,470
what's interesting is that one at two
the same way I control my records might

140
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,019
have been

141
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:48,089
i cant relievers records Miami so

142
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,190
if you look up for my IP address which
is 26 to 20 1969

143
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,959
59 you'll get tests cuz left or
recurrent

144
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:00,070
that cash to contain punctuation a
prosecutor valentine s

145
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,079
or angle brackets and stuff like that
which is have interest and will cover

146
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:04,930
that

147
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,000
briefly in a while

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,740
so mister with some re contact stuff

149
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,399
so as I said the best for but the nest
is a lot of every network

150
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,089
ever made which is cool

151
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,920
I should try to answer with a DNS once
as a security feature and it was an

152
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,079
absolute failure

153
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,300
you can update you can't you mostest
actions full-time

154
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,050
not I'm up I'll take longer is just
annoying

155
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,389
the most traffic is blocked yes traffic
gets to the rudder

156
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:38,259
most traffic is monitored by idsi PSX
tough yes traffic

157
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:43,399
chances are still mired button is
probably ignored most part

158
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,680
so here's kinda scenario I personally
owns Coast labs org

159
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,240
I guess and it points to where I want to
point to right now it's

160
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,560
and yes cancer but I can't reverse
record 24 record whatever

161
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,709
what to do with it that's interesting
and fun

162
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:01,509
so crisis acting like Miles so one thing
that's fine

163
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:06,480
such a user agents to Image Source it
was black we're glad this case contains

164
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,730
yo some unique and fired %uh schools
labs org

165
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,759
what's gonna happen think who now

166
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,240
what happens the the administering
please give you the logs and you can see

167
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,720
this

168
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,660
is going under the Ramsar and you can
see request you can serve ringel

169
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,870
hang on I was no XYZ dot com was
government was

170
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,019
on about this injection um

171
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:33,040
I can talk with this as a last weeks I
will iraq has Sally server is a tool for

172
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,649
managing a network

173
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,880
it some basically you can go service to
it which is updated

174
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,560
which is called push patches against us
its

175
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,259
you know I was reviewing it for you know
for fun because that's what we do

176
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:48,920
I'll give you a nice I like to see if I
can find issues and I found across a

177
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,470
scripting

178
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,000
on the mean age exactly this I will
happen is that anybody

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,769
who has never access the server could
plans in store cuz I scripting

180
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,440
using exactly as you can use region
using for forever whatever

181
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,970
into the and then logs and women later
be the locks who would run the browser

182
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,370
now being the fact is the server
management tool

183
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,230
is crisis gripping your browser means
quest to show on every server network

184
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,810
so I would rather have with this and
said like hey guys yet exist

185
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,370
and he said on the no its crisis
gripping that's moderate we'll fix those

186
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,209
its and now and I went young to nine
months go back for them

187
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,720
a mention in the video which on the
public on Twitter feed at some point

188
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,589
soon

189
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:31,360
and said in the video saying here's how
it on the network using right has had a

190
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,230
server

191
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,980
and they came back and said okok will
fix it here's here's a patch

192
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,380
and yours catches for are and will do
patches for other guy sitting as well

193
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,800
so a policy change was a huge victory
might be in

194
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,190
so thats it's been hashed if you're
under has however

195
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,440
miss you pat yourselves and on every
release their appeal see a couple days

196
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,060
or tuner for later I can now it's
anything

197
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,519
anyway this type of attack in logs can
actually work in this particular case

198
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,639
re: so in that situation let's go come
through step by step

199
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,579
I'll what exactly microscopy and logs

200
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:14,500
so the admin is going to go to the Final
server in San'a should be request

201
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,190
if he returned he should know that we
use these regions because they said

202
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,230
show me all these regions and he said a
look we use region called image source:

203
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,410
equals better that

204
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,279
they're going to say like hey on this is
an image below it

205
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,290
so it's going to a request to load the
image

206
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,800
first making this request irishman say

207
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,170
never heard it and alright so

208
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,699
the image doesn't load and life goes on

209
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:46,540
um to somebody who's doing is a response
type stuff if you see IP address and

210
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,120
locks

211
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,069
and you typing a tree try to do is look
up anna says host not found

212
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:55,500
we did you are you gonna say like maybe
some people the answer whose tricking me

213
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,089
into saying that was not found

214
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:00,100
or you say like oh this is probably just
nothing

215
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:06,339
chances are you can follow up on it not
sway sizes cool

216
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:09,639
so should be with other love it

217
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,930
we care because the packet captures look
completely innocent more last

218
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,420
use EDS requests going to DNS server
that's okay

219
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,069
we're kicking off network so fireballs
don't care and as stealthy as

220
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:23,339
heck from yeah full

221
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,920
so basically we get on service what's
the connection without the cash in every

222
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,519
succeeding

223
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,370
or being logged so at school

224
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,370
email so if you wanna see if anybody's

225
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,230
trying to email you with actually let me
get through I love is even a real reason

226
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,300
situations just

227
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,110
it's just the thought that would be a
cool

228
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,240
so I stand up my big yessir

229
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,089
these longer by the way is a very very
simple yes or a roach is written in C

230
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:53,110
he basically helped respond with
everything a response to that

231
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,660
20 on everything with 1234 there is an
evident 1234

232
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,350
and log everything I'm you can make it
happen page chilling at the end

233
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,129
its partner and be 20 anyway

234
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:07,839
Peterson are type your email address in
admin at

235
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,800
my to me know org I I press check
address this is simply some

236
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,699
to look online it says 0 demean develop

237
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:18,730
toward once again to somebody who's
trying to email you

238
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,439
they just see an immediate failure and
they think 0 your

239
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:26,310
gone when I see is someone's trying to
use as

240
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,529
email address in some way is an
interesting

241
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:32,790
maybe not but whether

242
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,060
I am searchers sequence action so

243
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,209
these commands have never actually
tested but it seems logical to me that

244
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:40,019
he's work

245
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,600
so you must be very email other Kia
commands to

246
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,810
two-out cluster servers impulse Eagle
server in my school I think

247
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,949
well yeah first one civil service at my
school

248
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:55,689
and usable commands should in theory
cause network connection

249
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:59,279
to attempt to be made and once again all
looking for is

250
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,430
is a survival yes or no if it if it
comes to that request

251
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,269
it's vulnerable if it doesn't its
probably not

252
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:10,329
at least at least two young

253
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:13,560
root level 0 sequence action

254
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,050
if you had non-root users not work as
well

255
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,569
so speaking have just as bad as xx is
awesome

256
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:26,089
so um about

257
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:30,329
when this now the few months ago anyway
I detect if I wrote a blog post

258
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,660
that so for my java Google to rewind is

259
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,410
are gonna be worse program PRP you guys
find bones in your Google services are

260
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,029
anything that we run basically and you
submit to us know of a crisis gripping

261
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:43,360
on Gmail or whatever

262
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,509
and we say you did here's money and

263
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:49,600
it's great because you have to hire more
researchers and is also great because we

264
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,160
find a balance thanks to people like you

265
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,350
was legal anyway detected by submitted
an exit even a bill

266
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,689
the xx he is XML external entities

267
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:05,089
which means whoever XML deciding good
idea and maybe it was a good idea

268
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,740
to be able to include other files your
XML CSA

269
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,999
imagine of all I want to include such
ABC's lost password

270
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:15,089
as file and you that

271
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:19,170
works in XML and returns the file to you
if you read the detective my blog is the

272
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:19,980
screenshot

273
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,970
sensitive Google's Akgul EU passar file

274
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,350
so it's pretty cool um

275
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,069
is really it actually in united by a
possible 20 more them

276
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:34,220
various quality so being

277
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,420
get its it's in the attack you archery
file we all servers

278
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,970
so will you use this um xxc

279
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,670
file concise std's password was gonna do
this is honorable

280
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,790
using except the Excel part is
configured wrong its gonna try to read

281
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,860
such conditions as password and include
this in your

282
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,779
in the actual file and this might work
if there's a if the file exists

283
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,079
and if actions can figure that way in
such it might not work

284
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,420
it may be available to it but this the
founders exist so so

285
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,049
this doesn't work you can also the
faster more servers

286
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:10,750
and I saw this a lot when not people
reporting monstrous

287
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,010
people saying like stretch issue because
I school FCAT

288
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,370
tackle from eso

289
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,299
you like countries who is going so
because you can

290
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:27,199
ping other servers um running for a
second

291
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,400
so you can you include google.ca or some
other domain

292
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,870
you any any web page and enter you can
clean their and the firewall

293
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,200
it might not work if there's you know if
something is weird and server in my

294
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,390
network

295
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,659
well we'll work however is the DS lookup
she saying

296
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:47,150
do a question should be concise ash my
timing org

297
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,529
and once again you the firewall weird
filesystem the files over a cold all

298
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,470
black

299
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,279
usually take this its cool week on Tues

300
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,090
what we should be doing this think I'll
of the time

301
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,659
me your so quick sign a vocal for to go
for broke all

302
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:09,169
coping on the issue P golfer has very
little overhead

303
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:12,450
which is cool because it means you can
send basically arbitrary strings to a

304
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:12,980
server

305
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,110
vehicle for what the BX whatsoever

306
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,350
and this is your company said in
obviously censored from a real world

307
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,799
and has been a long time ago we found an
XX he selling a billion a server

308
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,659
think I will follow including 311 and we
use that

309
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:31,860
to to fetch go for calls I slashed

310
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,669
look a host for 25 the big a just cause
go for

311
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:39,230
something I'll and the rest week we put
SMTP

312
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,659
aglo newline mail from test it has to
calm

313
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:46,669
newline receipt to ronit never come
--pr.com--

314
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,330
so on and where it was in the email to
go for broke all

315
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,370
against the local SMTP server

316
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,260
as pretty cool basically any kind of
attack that requires only a single TCP

317
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,320
packet

318
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,570
can be compromised through this have a
pro call

319
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,730
pretty like that

320
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,620
no she the question was that are
required to serve as your angle for

321
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,080
in answer is no because go for much the
HTP can be sent to essentially any port

322
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,470
you take over course I slash local host
port 445

323
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,570
flashback as he can to perform for five

324
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,870
an attempt to set a goal for style
request to the airport

325
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,710
the porch not understand over because
like I said it's not be running

326
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,440
however the packet was still sent and
response to him back

327
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,659
the fact that the server didn't know who
purse response

328
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:39,640
doesn't really matter in this case the
what does require is for

329
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,900
where sketching the file to Asher's
angle for whether it's PHP whether it's

330
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,760
XML parser whatever you have new using
and that resembles and still do

331
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,140
because no Gophers no use it but still

332
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,500
exists so

333
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,260
yet so using DSL exploiters have ability
is exceptionally unlikely

334
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,909
but yes can find it on the ability and
then it uses to exploit actually

335
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:07,480
do fun stuff and on so you can afford
talk about how

336
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,730
to do that as well go for after she won
in the past so

337
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,659
yeah you find it

338
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:17,909
the PHP F open much like x60 um

339
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:20,909
basically all the versions appease p

340
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:24,700
a new versions misconfigured PHP can
open URL's

341
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,630
6af open issue because I slash black and
it'll open the URL

342
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,090
so you ever allow an attacker to file
names this

343
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,250
might work so once again is the same as
all the other phones

344
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,350
you send issue because I slashed your
domain

345
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,610
an easy disorder back to you yes mobile
no

346
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,230
sup easy challenge action

347
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,970
is my favorite this is less protection

348
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,429
so basically injected a as lookup are
paying

349
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:57,929
or W get are with everyone in every
field 17 s ever

350
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:01,289
so have a web application and say go

351
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,380
by using Eagles Nest cynical as like a
black or my area

352
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,890
my pastor is back to clap tactic you

353
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,480
true story I have must that I muscle
talent

354
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,039
um a few jobs according to consulting
gig and

355
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:19,760
I was using drugs weed for pro with a
scanner and I

356
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,490
I would be the voice mail server and
said like hickey has voicemail server

357
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,840
you open up the same password and that's
it like probably not

358
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,940
go to my PC Connection beyond that is
not all else

359
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,630
no attack surface so I utility shields
test test

360
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,140
are under sweet and say okay do you're
scanning

361
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,649
and he said shall injection it has
revealed I said

362
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:45,640
koolhaas positive I'll try myself so I
put it has a field

363
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,710
bactech pingel Coast actually fiber
whatever takes five seconds

364
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,340
Quinn since I tried back takes 3-10
tactic takes 10 seconds

365
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,179
and okay so I use this space redo

366
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:01,789
2 I'm copy the code of the server I had
to see you like

367
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:05,100
physical phone ahead to see how it
worked so it turns out there is a

368
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,130
training program for

369
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,880
for password hashing and passing the
pass from the command line

370
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,860
so in right

371
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,649
this has to happen we never expected you
John Jackson St Peter's

372
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:21,059
for example so

373
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:24,240
once again so whenever childhood and
look up in our server logs

374
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,809
it's a field look up nothing too sketchy
in in your end

375
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:32,409
you see that ok this is horrible i'm for
the fun part

376
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:36,179
and you know I'd lose its just now I had
decided last night so sorry I skip the

377
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:36,799
syntax

378
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,399
but in my user agent from now on is
gonna be

379
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:44,980
good bracket bracket test SantaCon

380
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,840
yet he as actually generates across like
it anyway

381
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,850
to basically make these regions equal to
some random deterministic string does

382
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,240
cause not so org

383
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,000
but now that this holidays ok thanks for
doing this instead

384
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,820
a course real men do that yeah

385
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,929
from because you know that if or chrome
just the US is the server

386
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:14,240
alright let's look at a couple the tax

387
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,309
so security is always a boundary is
whether it's

388
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:20,399
cold and boundaries with this broad
network boundaries when there's about

389
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,120
you know crypto boundaries with
boundaries distrust of a one-sided

390
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,990
interest up to decide

391
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,169
the thing is DS tend to be fairly trust
in if I do a DS lookup

392
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:33,260
reverse lookup for you know when the two
three or four

393
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,529
expect a response from the S happy to be
fairly

394
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:41,690
good because it's from yes through
that's not really the case

395
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,519
so this is from past capture flag from
maybe

396
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,190
eight months ago me and this is a PHP
code

397
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,070
so basically which are seeing is

398
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,330
I've girls so

399
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,840
actors it was good host by address I'm
so peace be server mode address

400
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,440
is my IP address so basically do a
reverse lookup my IP address

401
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,700
a store in you dr. then do a DNS get
record

402
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,450
our Miami addressed soaker hose magis

403
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,750
from IP address returns test scores at
work this could afford a quest for all

404
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,320
records for test this cause labs org

405
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,159
so details gets the full records follows
and then

406
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,779
is going to ask your curry an see
connection right

407
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:32,799
this was really somewhat have to exploit
because it's an update

408
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,799
and updates suck for sequence action so
I apologize for really

409
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,070
complicated exploit but this

410
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,620
though the senior problems we look at
them ago like he-ro tool for this

411
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,200
my hair problems so is his DS logger is
great

412
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,309
like I said yes longer can be configured
return any any record you want

413
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:54,399
so this case at all to return tax record
out test

414
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:58,690
quotation mark love the black was really
causes wheels were ever

415
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,029
and reverse DNS lookup so

416
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:06,440
if they had said well if the inside your
address equals

417
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,100
it was my dresser remote address and
then but that it was you agree

418
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,279
that was to leave honorable but explains
families reversed his record islamic

419
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,980
difficult than 40 s

420
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,750
but still possible if you're interested
more this

421
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,450
I have a blog is opposite sides to to
turn south after

422
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,399
the blog at the bottom there is
basically an outline of how this attack

423
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:30,899
work step by step

424
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:34,740
from for most for most attacks I've
actually written up you're fairly

425
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,149
fairly detailed logs about them a tribal
going to the one the signs

426
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:43,679
so feel free to add more information to
check my blogs

427
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,740
alright so cross-site scripting 3ds

428
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,929
are about this blog four years ago or a
robust my blog for years ago

429
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:55,539
and I i basically semi reversed my reg
txt record

430
00:25:55,539 --> 00:26:00,620
to that which is a demeanor owner
Jeffrey file I control

431
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,690
and I want to I could then the top few
result on Google for

432
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,850
reverse DNS lookup or DS look up for
something

433
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,960
and all three top sites no 303 top sites

434
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,080
and Ike by the tenor in a tent or
something other sites in top 10

435
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,200
questionable to chronic scripting your

436
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,370
am TXT records yes records as I me this
week I posted the same her own ability

437
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,029
to

438
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:28,029
to somewhere my friend would be to it
and to hear this week which is the talk

439
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:32,250
I said guys I'm religious thing half a
decade ago

440
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,850
so anyway that set that attack vector

441
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:39,240
ice report what size are liable to and I
see one go back to being thank you to

442
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,710
rest

443
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,620
unit which is typical many cases

444
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,870
I retested where ok this and only one of
the sites where o'neal

445
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:52,570
I didn't report this time cuz raising

446
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,720
alright so DNS rebinding this is kinda
place in the stock

447
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,269
so it's also super complex and I took a
more than just an FYI mining

448
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:07,070
but I was the example use %um use
complex here

449
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,480
so be so basically we have

450
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,890
a user had upon their hid behind a
firewall

451
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,250
is a trusted service and left is a
writer that you can go through it is dns

452
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,289
I left there's internet which is just
cast and then the black-headed

453
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:26,190
up there so the user setup

454
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,389
be a the user for some reason goes to my
evil HD go the issue because I sash

455
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:35,500
school so how does that work slash hello
the issue well

456
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,519
you could be an iframe you can be in
like you know you can come now via email

457
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,309
them

458
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:45,289
it doesn't matter so Utes look up for
for Scotts crossing arms at work

459
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:49,230
and once again I control this so I miss
a

460
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:52,990
0 hasn't testicles labs org let me up
there

461
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,820
last 26 to 20 minutes 59 is it okay to
connect to that

462
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:00,710
and that be around an look at so we have
you do on the Internet

463
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:04,600
and then you can you can create cookies
increase session you can do whatever you

464
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,149
want

465
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,659
on your server then later on thing

466
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:11,679
these are businesses ever again you look
up and say what's

467
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,760
what's your address again for school
Scott absorbed

468
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,850
and is it makes my browsers cuz modern
browsers will let you do this they want

469
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,980
to change if you dress

470
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,080
while you in in transit but you may be
thinking about next day or something

471
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,049
and they look at the beginning and this
time I say all the IP addresses

472
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:30,559
went to the what is it does your that
one so suddenly attacked the trusted

473
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,130
server

474
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,210
with cookies that they had controls so

475
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,730
I've been asked before like is cookie
injection actually

476
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,090
hurts raises crisis gripping via cookies
actually

477
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,169
the matter and I yet sometimes doesn't
matter because sometimes you can check

478
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:46,740
cookies

479
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,100
this just one way

480
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,409
so so the user session the they never
got a chance to service

481
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:58,090
you know the they think they're at some
sketchy site probably so

482
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,470
they probably aren't doing anything like
the password and stuff but this review

483
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,570
session tokens he's in a browser stuff
like that

484
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,380
the stuff the server does automatically
and once again this this

485
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,330
this this requires that the trust
services compete in such a way that you

486
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,429
can connect with her on FB

487
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:16,809
with their own DNS name sometimes works
incident

488
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:20,110
anyway later on the next day these are
real was around her and visit the page

489
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,880
again

490
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,470
and this time it might be dressed again
so any cookies are set the local storage

491
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,450
anything like that any sessions are
going to let me know

492
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,419
chances are your sessions might not be
addressing compete with an interesting

493
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:32,769
but

494
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:37,149
you never know it's worth you anyway

495
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:41,399
so busy that those two things really
really quick I used yes reminding to

496
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,399
sneak attack into context

497
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:46,970
by switching on my server with the with
the trust no one

498
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:52,399
and then I I did the opposite to sneak
stuff back on the Internet

499
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,510
as we talk about this mostly because it
shows how DNS is kinda

500
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,039
street sometimes browsers trust yes
implicitly

501
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,539
if you go to test this was not at work
now and you'll tomorrow

502
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,889
as well your browser concern is the
exact same cycle times send cookies

503
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,139
some local stores and everything that
i'd and

504
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:16,299
isn't necessarily the case because like
a demonstrated yes can change

505
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:21,630
yeah let's talk with paneling

506
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,659
Israel for graphic by the way

507
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,710
re: so

508
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,220
this up I'll be live with the symbol for
this crowd but anyway

509
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,330
know much radiation you comment the
server

510
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,320
you communicate with it stuff happens
how's it look

511
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,919
a ban chill is the firewall River shell
is a firewall

512
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,470
Lee and a CBS is great because our proxy
in

513
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,789
I love never school you know that's a
comics by now so

514
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:51,960
hopefully most networks will you get
that

515
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,010
but of course DNS this diagram much
earlier

516
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:59,059
most traffic is blocked yes we'll never
get lost

517
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:02,919
so can we do to weaken case with Eunice
yes obviously yes

518
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,500
was sucked into a huge with US lets you
I C

519
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,610
basically the first promises one way
street the client can take the server

520
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,190
but not vice versa

521
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,389
this hurricane ever initiate action take
he crying eyes indicted for you

522
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:21,649
can happen so where do is that cool

523
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:25,659
so the client's because I will say like
hey here's my god that

524
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:30,440
do anything your day you anything back
and forth back and forth

525
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,860
it is no doubt i still send like hey I
know that me neither I got it

526
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,590
you neither so I will never know

527
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:41,429
agree with that so an ideal situation

528
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:44,460
is it looks like ya gonna cited the
coldest

529
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,580
knock-knock joke was worth so

530
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,679
the concert a hey I'm a cheesy record
for black as coal sales org

531
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,720
are give me a txt records for Alaska's
as org

532
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,360
this work just as well MX record setting
records even the records if you went for

533
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
my time which is really slow

534
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,029
so they I that might expect her to
please me to see record for black

535
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:07,370
as a response is black and he says okay

536
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:13,019
now UTC Rev got and each time you say if
you waited at a back-and-forth

537
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:16,549
sometimes we know that so say it was a
txt for nothing

538
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:20,019
an and the server has done a cached are
ready so it sends

539
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:24,710
stat if this is audience actually worked

540
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,960
it be great and fortune is not

541
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,519
so in reality behind his say know what
it takes you for that

542
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,399
then with the waiting is getting again
some from the US tax will sent with

543
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:38,779
request immediately

544
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:41,789
and now we've responses just like fire
for getting

545
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:45,320
seriously it does this in responding

546
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,029
before the first question say oh is this
and then ask you can cause I think we

547
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:49,690
got three

548
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,309
there response yet and use news when the
next request

549
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:57,190
as becomes is like don't forget it

550
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:01,590
be its it up horrible horrible pain

551
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,590
now you can tell it to be over DNS which
holds like these

552
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:09,080
but he's not designed for such a
horrible network so these problems

553
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,019
so do as a super reliable
retransmissions marks actually common

554
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,240
drops are simply common like us and

555
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,919
obvious clients and relays we'll
gradually see gratuitously retransmit

556
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,210
and I have aside maginnis but some

557
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,460
the answer is also must find a they all
just like forwarded

558
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,850
failed take it they'll parse it they'll
re rebuild the pack in the senate

559
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,880
which doesn't sound like a big deal
except all sexed is not case sensitive

560
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,120
Nash lower case is everything so my
first version DS get those testing

561
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,840
I use base64 for encoding because I
needed non

562
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,450
no nails it turns out that or text would
just

563
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,779
take all the uppercase locations in Long
which was super irritating because

564
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,200
I can hear why wasn't working

565
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,340
sign a deal to program design I cycle
sign so it's probably not the best but

566
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,360
ABC made it easy P style Procol

567
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,639
um higher I mention

568
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:09,610
Mazari so the is is Prix for missus like
I said you can put

569
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,169
angle brackets through you can work with
his remarks through and you can block

570
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:14,490
and the crazy stuff through it

571
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:19,000
depending on the answer her obviously
all you really guaranteed to work

572
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,280
is letters numbers and maybe a couple
symbols

573
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,450
even at least get you out letters
numbers on really comfortable with

574
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:30,560
so she wrote a beast 32 or beast 36

575
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,169
implantation and it turned out to be
like no 2 percent faster than text cite

576
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:36,560
this is going to be the next

577
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,190
him you'll see like you note 66 at six
episodes labs org

578
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,560
rate right now there's no corruption is
not my god secure

579
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,389
plain text like this hiring and you
mention it

580
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:53,119
I start a 64 bit OS X St Pats wouldn't
work

581
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,500
car is in its basic you every searchers
were on the airplane once

582
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,319
and it was complex and scary toppers in
that nothing's

583
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:03,410
bruh it was work that the extra taxers

584
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,800
so that's all well and good

585
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,910
I got this working agree my lap you look
using local host

586
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,859
yes can talk with health and is great in
the real world and work mostly except

587
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:19,000
not quite so I would request like this

588
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,339
regular session once again these are the
only thing funny I

589
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:25,569
I don't want but feel free to do that

590
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:29,819
so you see what a txt record here it is
sixty record curious TXT record

591
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:33,170
everything's working great until you say

592
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:38,460
give it easier blank it's blank he's he
was 20 blank

593
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,390
the survey ever sees it it is the bike
response was it easy for blank

594
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,520
no response as I call myself a two-hour
check your what was going on

595
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,700
it turns out cashing

596
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,240
even the GD has ID value stuff like that

597
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,109
your intermediate servers will still
tried to cash things

598
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:02,089
it is a detailed 21 one second also try
catch things just

599
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:05,220
DS doesn't mostly in services are weird

600
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,109
so don't fix it was really easy i jus
and around the field

601
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:12,640
i 16v ran a field every packet which is
meaningless other than

602
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,030
it fixes catching be

603
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,369
so the protocol has sin

604
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:23,829
yesen message in re:

605
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:27,369
let's do a demo

606
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:32,270
ago you for time alright

607
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,089
so this window here which is release
camaraderie

608
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:41,200
iPod touch that but these against so
this when he was measured at home

609
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,359
its is the third him name server for
sconce labs org

610
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,390
so I was doing not yet but

611
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,329
both run ideas longer on this you see
all requests for Scotland's or go to

612
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:52,770
this

613
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,040
server right now is no user running

614
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,060
where he was going to run the when yes
getting

615
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,450
so you think im pac man let's give it to
the meanings into

616
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,359
you can get one or two or 10 the
meanings you cuz even on

617
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,550
it has no the main aims at where does it
just the only accept direct requests a

618
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,869
good record for 53

619
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:18,510
if you even a military records requests

620
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:22,579
very so I try to most look after Nestle

621
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:26,290
arbiter period is so using and

622
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,730
atop their how the run yes can on the
client

623
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,079
he's actually really personal command
see good your decent help

624
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,390
missile command you can use you help me
man's

625
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:41,200
either that each yeah she's the calipers
are building which is

626
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,569
can eat on this laptop

627
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:48,630
I mean is because when there wasn't a
cooler Fort Worth I have

628
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,310
this works natively on Windows and Linux
and probably all sexed

629
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,329
deftly BST so it the client is in C

630
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:58,680
the servers and Ruby its it runs
natively

631
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,180
come out to be used to you or with make
and on there's no dependencies

632
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,380
its is like a cat it should run
everywhere

633
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,060
all right something the run the client
here we'll see is excessive hopes up

634
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,140
musicians I wish just for on it

635
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:22,050
I'm assuming it's all here thing yes

636
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,369
let the stalking me mistaken I do a test
run

637
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,030
and I cycle time when things like crap I
screwed up something

638
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,240
so I went I spent two hours in the hotel
bar tonight fixing it and the next day

639
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,440
for got to do a couple

640
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,089
and because again anyway

641
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:41,280
this might take awhile so for it pricing
in its possession tablished

642
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,510
I can run the sessions command just like
that interpreter mess which

643
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:48,780
as a I McMahon section that's the
position type:

644
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,990
second drug concessions as an
interpreter and say

645
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,869
the transition use help with the
commands

646
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:59,030
so this damage inside this isn't like a
subtropical

647
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,730
basically it's like a pro I wrote
designed for at this link with her first

648
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,440
book or really

649
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,670
some devilish look at throwing it into
mature for your cuz I think they be

650
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:12,650
know the basic the same thing but you
love English is something to it

651
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,329
Rancho was good he was as his send the
command to the server and say please

652
00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:17,450
excuse shell

653
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:22,119
if it's when there was a run cmd
vigilance runs bash

654
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,589
not concessions it's insane now I have
the session 1 comment session

655
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:30,599
and session to excuse L with the star
means that there's text there they

656
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,109
haven't seen yet

657
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:36,740
a contract position to and say Hey look
shell

658
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,020
so have a pack accha laga still on this
machine that's

659
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,250
worth rooting other than that his BM

660
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:47,569
which is really going for millions but I
assure you that all the all packets from

661
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:48,810
this laptop is one

662
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:53,020
are going to hold it as hard hierarchy
all the way through

663
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,640
so we shall boring

664
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,190
you can see the speed you like it's nice
asses native because

665
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,589
everything too broken up into this I
said yes package

666
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:08,480
CNC see some delays

667
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,970
actually test test around them Iran

668
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:15,819
basically cast such steps as you read
them through hex dump

669
00:40:15,819 --> 00:40:19,050
and Michael for couple hours and it all
worked

670
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,980
after murdering the answers where
wondering why the hell is much better

671
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,260
data come from Google

672
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,619
I'm anyway not my problem

673
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:30,880
re: like a presidential the resent is
missing and that too

674
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,240
back in session but this this the
running

675
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,300
just like once again as a contributor my

676
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,579
X-rays here like that occur a second man
show here

677
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:49,579
you Mia you once again

678
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:02,970
year

679
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,730
in

680
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:12,760
soaring again you can authors establish
them

681
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,810
stole his heart you see that there's an
established

682
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,510
some time has come to even seen yet we
can track with it you know

683
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,740
senior we can execute things

684
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,250
from its windows

685
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:34,700
so I see I said russians old so I say
exactly Nash

686
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,150
a new session session for some
established so in taxation for

687
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:46,150
now I bash this is

688
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:52,320
settling for what's worse anything 30

689
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,440
gonna backhanded

690
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,720
right one more thing in this is this the
democrats last time so

691
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,369
fingers crossed I'm

692
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:10,960
so I can I see any personal

693
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,990
create a file 90

694
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:20,460
every single time alright

695
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,830
ago

696
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,839
hi me it's wrong when they realize been

697
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,920
I'm I'm

698
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,440
hearings agree the file obviously

699
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,490
with cooling down the aisle now from
this argument which eliminates

700
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,520
demonstrations by you session number

701
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:47,020
3 I can along

702
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:53,480
I know that is hard and with the
password file

703
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,270
0

704
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,900
therapy file very buying

705
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:08,880
when the attack will actually damaging

706
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,359
is on the command line is these up and
down to use

707
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,550
all commands is not one is doing its my
program unit

708
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,830
anyway the point is you know similar
warning

709
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,810
so you have a policy that allows the
rationale occurred at about it

710
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,970
so it still early stages but the Tool
Works is stable

711
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,040
and I'm really happy with it I really
yeah

712
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,839
%ah

713
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:39,970
I'm good feeling to it on been on
Twitter and I'm I get have

714
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,900
coming home page I'm also happy with her
with the current state senator releasing

715
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:44,869
an album version

716
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:48,529
and couples everywhere if you guys could
test it out

717
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:53,460
i'd super appreciate it I'm sure there's
bugs a few future plans

718
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,789
who this real quick um so traffic
warning

719
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:00,829
I would love ones discussions
established before traffic

720
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:05,910
inside network nope it through DNS I
really acting up a diagram

721
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,450
where on the endpoint ok a SOCKS proxy
question mark

722
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:13,259
profit in my original version DS have
one

723
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:16,339
I ate I try to be everything I tried to

724
00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:20,009
I should talk with nationally but
believe that in the first person to ask

725
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:22,279
I tried everything I tried to IM

726
00:44:22,279 --> 00:44:26,359
be a client the client servers in
program use it for real

727
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:29,369
your airplane you wanted tech to your we
helping

728
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:33,420
it works you a you don't tell never but
they realize it's been done already

729
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,539
people very written me tools I i to be
/c tunnel

730
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:40,589
Richard over 18s so that's why focuses
more on contesting more on

731
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:45,430
you Michelle now it now you you can you
have a DNS to explain how you

732
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:49,690
you can of Michelle Egan tools and stuff
is totally focus on and has no it's got

733
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,670
nothing to do with her

734
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,420
with with strip coming anymore so when I
could do in

735
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,650
over to nicole for this and it kinda
works but I have a really in a country

736
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,839
we have enough to demonstrate

737
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:04,339
or two happen hookup basically

738
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:08,160
you see on I will open up ports from the
own client to

739
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,289
1.2 the three or four portend on
whenever on for 4 for 5

740
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:15,619
and then I want the server the server
side so my

741
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:19,249
server on this laptop were to listen

742
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:22,249
I'm or 1234 then you can send

743
00:45:22,249 --> 00:45:27,029
a packet super 1234 come to get a sample
for high and basically everything to us.

744
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:28,369
busy proxy with yes

745
00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:31,719
l0 socks for practical use that same
thing

746
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:35,719
see you see all the clients you're
starting a server produce kind on their

747
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:39,910
and then you can your browser to network
to his client because they're just

748
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:40,710
haven't left yet

749
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:44,729
I'm like enough that's coming shellcode

750
00:45:44,729 --> 00:45:48,789
promotional code so right now the Escape
is only a txt file or

751
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:52,769
the next binary file and we all know
running

752
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:56,729
binary files other machines is difficult
miss you bash so

753
00:45:56,729 --> 00:46:00,640
basically you you know explains that go
through this

754
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,880
but carried you as payload the

755
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,579
yes absolutely I rode parochial tsk won
a couple years ago

756
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:10,890
the code is down there basically a
contributing

757
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:14,150
he's holding his head pro call on the
next about 250 bites

758
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:17,849
when those just over 1000 bytes it's not
great but not bad for choco

759
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:21,660
but wait there's more sorrow stager

760
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,670
I want to see you again under 300 bytes
which was a size are the MS we'll 67

761
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:28,680
capitals ice and win32 image to get

762
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,359
as as de este Jourdan it went through
two bites basically

763
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:35,869
USN called it was very much a text
records liking one does cause I'm dork

764
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:36,440
to discuss

765
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,910
as Arg Intel a good annexed record
basically to confine its Dennis ran we

766
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:42,400
ever got

767
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,700
not secure whatsoever but really simple
small

768
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,829
major happy with these things

769
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:54,259
very Flickr status um working hard to
finish up stuff

770
00:46:54,259 --> 00:46:58,619
I'm know that this is a little agree
happy now with you I and its

771
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,219
last few things be going over to break
stuff the code is there

772
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:05,869
on the last night as well and neck

773
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:09,400
the Cricket Council annexing when yes
the images to you and is there was a

774
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,460
shit about what's next

775
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,059
I still have a second test on so up to
grab a friend that sometime

776
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:17,999
one more quick thing in London so
detection

777
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:21,509
eyes one friend who does like the
opposite me he like

778
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:25,549
fixer stuffers I break stuff and yours
is like you always do these talks

779
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:28,460
you never talk about how to prevent
things I said that's cos prince is

780
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:28,969
boring

781
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:33,460
especially boot bootie people here have
you for saying that but I i agree.

782
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,640
someone fixing stuff

783
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,890
but so anyway detection is trivial

784
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:41,069
the thing is that you do it if you see
like

785
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:44,789
ideas because we every one sec if an
exercise something's going wrong

786
00:47:44,789 --> 00:47:48,219
if you see like I make you may already
SAT and a

787
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:52,249
for one client something's gone wrong
like this is really easy to detect

788
00:47:52,249 --> 00:47:55,440
that being said that's the tunneling
getting stuff like

789
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,420
series region Usenet if I crisis
gripping that's really really hard to

790
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,249
detect because only

791
00:48:00,249 --> 00:48:03,900
all you see from the company is FLDS
request and

792
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,960
thats in happens every day so yeah

793
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,099
lucky in traffic if you're if you're a
vegetarian

794
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,259
log yes traffic and look for ways to
from

795
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,450
yeah and that's crucial have

796
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:19,309
so
