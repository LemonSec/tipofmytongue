1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,730
art everyone my name is victim on a

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,940
this is Josh down arm were both Penn
testers for PSE

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,790
we are the Security Labs team

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,530
I am here's our information I'll

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,240
we both have blogs I'll admit that
charge

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,289
updates more regularly than I do on but
we are both committed to sharing

7
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,019
information

8
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:29,460
here's our picture injustice if you
forget her face so let's talk about the

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,029
philosophy however he ran on the faucet

10
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:36,870
be behind our starve application Tom I
was about maybe

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,410
over a year ago that Josh in Iraq had
tossing around ideas on

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,899
arm about how we can improve om

13
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,530
existing a tactic to existing attacks to
attack that we see

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,850
on everyday pen testing our assessments
and and how we can actually capitalize

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,969
on those that

16
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:57,789
are kinda limited and so we others I'll
taxes SMB really attack

17
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:01,000
arm so just really at a show of hands is

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,260
anyone from the anyone here familiar
with the S&P really attack

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,340
idea there are few and get better be

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,710
there and I'll ask so um going back

21
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,960
so without me really attack there are a
few there are few limitations there that

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,189
really arm

23
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:21,659
I really make a at ineffective as are as
hell

24
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,689
the potential who are we recognize that
there is on capitol with SMB really

25
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:27,119
attack

26
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,670
and we really want to capitalize on on
it we believe as Penn testers is in our

27
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,560
DNA

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,079
that we want to X exceed the boundaries
pushed the envelope

29
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,530
really on every assessment we go on we
always think about how

30
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,570
can we make this more efficient answer
really that's where it all began

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,250
and for the past %uh over the year we
really steadily developed often on Han

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,470
trying to get this attack %ah more
effective and how we can optimize and

33
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,560
so are just kinda quick and dirty intro
on SMB really tackled

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,689
explain how exactly it works and it take
a look at the diagram here

35
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,960
how will happen number one is convincing
your victim to authenticate attacker

36
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,090
on this could be big this disconnect be
called the several ways

37
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,930
are Muslim usually the top five ways is
our

38
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,920
well we have lol up and in SL on our
poisoning or spitting

39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,920
are poisoning DNS teach DHCP us brooding
poisoning

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,450
we had not doesn't really matter how you
get there just on you get there

41
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,000
harmen really what we want is to harvest
at the or to receive authentication

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,840
request from our victim number two is to
initiate once we receive it on occasion

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,879
but you want to

44
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,599
go ahead and initiate a new connection
to our target I'll

45
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,120
what's that connection newt's connection
has been established we wanna go ahead

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,940
and related then occasion process

47
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,640
between the victim and the target and
back and forth until that the occasion

48
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,379
is complete

49
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,530
was a medications complete will go ahead
and terminate the connection

50
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,920
are usually if you're familiar with SB
really implementations out there you'll

51
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,560
notice that

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,150
other client from the class I did just
says access denied

53
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,330
and then for and and it made a move on
but on our side

54
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,099
and step by will go ahead and had art
and product was it which is not indicate

55
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,840
session

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,190
so there are like I said previously
there are limitations out there with

57
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,019
assimilate act hom

58
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,810
and really it the limitations are out
there so they

59
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,500
really makes it not as an effective
solution for

60
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,760
actually accomplish are copper mine in
that work house I'll show you why

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,690
are for starters MSOE 068 which was
released in November 2008

62
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,560
arm this attack really arm prior to this

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,170
part to this patch be released on
attackers could essentially really the

64
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,760
credentials back to the victim

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,150
and on the victim instead I N oh and
authenticate victim

66
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,250
arm is really a free-for-all then after
that %ah

67
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,650
after the patch was released attacker or
attackers had to are

68
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,450
adapt sort of and now on the current
implementation is

69
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,450
reeling those credentials to another
target server on the second-biggest

70
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,140
are caviar really the limitation here is
what I call the

71
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,430
one hitter quitter affect and I'll
explain

72
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,890
on the one had a clear fact is really an
assumption on that the victim that you

73
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,569
are targeting nor the victim that

74
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,199
the victim possesses ado admission to
privileges to your server

75
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,550
are to your target server now the reason
why did this assumption because

76
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,770
Tom if you're targeting if you're
executing a payload

77
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,040
or you're trying to execute a command on
the target you need administrator

78
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,900
privileges to cop a step

79
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,669
so let's say for instance you're sitting
on the network and you're doing are

80
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:36,940
poisoning attack

81
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,210
are you doing element R&D in that
sweeping attack

82
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,330
an hour anything they're trying get all
his other kitchen press really your

83
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,750
essentially praying to the Active
Directory Gaza send your domain admin

84
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,650
account otherwise account the

85
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,690
the compromise really will be an
effective

86
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,800
arm the next and other solutions or to
execute a

87
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,620
S&P really attack is to harvester
credentials and then from there you can

88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,120
crack them with hash cat

89
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,169
or on John if you want

90
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,580
so we do like I said before we really
want to optimize S&P really attack

91
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,680
how we week Joshin i sat down and we

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,460
tree the shoplifter who will shopping
list are all the features we want to

93
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,720
implement and improve on existing attack

94
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,090
how can we make this better how can I
make this attack so there's more

95
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,889
profitable

96
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,960
to us are merely came up with a us are
less well

97
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,130
first up we have introduce holler S&P
teachers

98
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,120
so the S&P is not just limited to
executing payloads is not just limited

99
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,419
to you executing commands there's
actually more things in

100
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,720
somber or S&P you can't do other than
just

101
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,479
execute execute XQ on these other things
out there

102
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,850
we also wanted to add discover
enumeration

103
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,970
arm discover enumeration
information-gathering those are critical

104
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,039
components

105
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,370
in pen testing arm really so

106
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,430
without without discovering numeration
12 at that into our process

107
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,310
the so many things that we can gain from
are just from the low an informational

108
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,410
arm data that we can actually use in our
contest

109
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,250
are the next big one is performed
multiple at the bureau operations per

110
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,130
session

111
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,410
arm and that's a really big one because
currently right now if you ever

112
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,050
if you want to execute a payload white
the one extreme or the popular too hot

113
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,069
you would have to

114
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:30,740
have multiple incoming request or
authentication request

115
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,819
on what we really want it was a have one
authentic Asian

116
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:39,289
session and use multiple operations on
that one session

117
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,560
the last one is orth the sale as well as
support existing tools we also want to

118
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:43,830
be a

119
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,990
ability to use as an decline to use RPC
client use miss boy

120
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,400
to used the solomon et commands to use
PS exact and mapping is the scripts

121
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,550
we want to be able to not just limit
ourselves to be there are

122
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,240
own built-in applications went you to
have the ability to actually injected

123
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,550
any other S&P to where you want to use
in the last one was is the interface for

124
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,669
a centralized management

125
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:11,729
alarm when a treat when you have all
these incoming connections come to you

126
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,050
wanted the ability to

127
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,530
actually managed all those sessions and
be able to choose from the sessions as

128
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,000
as you want now application actually
maintain the sessions as you

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,770
as a as assisting continues

130
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,949
so here is a illustration up what arm we
really wanted to ask

131
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,889
ASM be attacked here's an optimized
attack so that the c-arm

132
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,280
there is another case session at the
bottom wanna in the case I should we

133
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,169
went to be able to perform all these
operations online session

134
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,039
on want to be able to enumerate users
enumerate shares download upload file

135
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:44,930
stop stop

136
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,960
us toplist increased services access
registry and played Halo did you wanted

137
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,430
to

138
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,580
and up prior to our application have you
already existing implementation of that

139
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,580
and be really attack you would have to
have

140
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,800
us eat us separate S& a

141
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,440
a separate authentication attempts for
each and every one of these operations

142
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,099
now

143
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,500
on we actually want to be able to keep
one session and foremost Papa rations

144
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,069
on that one session on that way on

145
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,910
that way if you do not have on police
account you can actually perform

146
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,430
other operations other than just having
a failed attempt at the Pentastar we

147
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,330
wanted to

148
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,379
a capitalize on every opportunity out
there not just leave it all or not just

149
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:31,650
the right away if it's not demand admin
account

150
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,320
so the everybody familiar with the
internals for SMB

151
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,339
probably Russian Mar shark little bit at
least this project we learned a

152
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:45,160
a great deal about SMB couple things we
just wanted to cover this is not a

153
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,740
a deep intro to SMBs just to say that
every SMB session follows a

154
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,089
certain that consistent process

155
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:56,470
first there's going to be a TCP
connection that gets established

156
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,779
usually 445 we're doing everything on
for forty five

157
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,709
but then after that the two systems
negotiate what kind of SMB they're gonna

158
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,110
speak because there are tons of them

159
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,330
there's invented in the eighties and so
they're at many many dialects it may be

160
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,190
selected

161
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,209
then after that a session setup occurs
that's rough indication happens

162
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,480
and then you have any number of
transactions which happen

163
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,250
within tree connect messages there with
an SMB

164
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,570
said really what happens is I get ninety
speaking action I

165
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,920
medicaid and then every time you list
files on a share

166
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,010
and every time you copy a file or
execute something

167
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,190
that's a different potentially different
reconnect but certainly

168
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,120
different transactions all within one
TCP connection

169
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,339
I so we authenticate at the beginning
and then have multiple transactions and

170
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:44,410
that's really the

171
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,610
attribute a SNB that lets us do

172
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,640
we're getting to know a sec also notice
right at the bottom

173
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,399
we've got SMB log off so and they're
actually a couple different ways as any

174
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,540
sessions terminate but

175
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,600
the proper way is for the client or the
server to send an SMB La got message

176
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,260
saying

177
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,300
the session is done so if you got that
effort only

178
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,200
in your head I think the next out church
in should help a little bit

179
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,730
this is what we're going to do we go
back here

180
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,110
at SMB log off is that terminates the
session so

181
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,140
this shows you what the at what our tool
does I

182
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,610
and and now also get this into more of a
general approach are a lot of protocols

183
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,310
we can do the exact same thing

184
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,390
the client authenticates and were
relaying the session

185
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,550
the client does some transactions it
could be one transaction could be a

186
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,050
thousand we don't really care

187
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,329
when the client is done and it logs of
we just don't deliver a blog of

188
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:41,480
and we keep the session up we let the
client disappear

189
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,850
and we hang on to that authenticates
session and then we enter our own loop

190
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,029
where we open a listener on the local
host and you can connect

191
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:53,399
any SMB tool into that and it'll
continue to use that same session

192
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,750
is authenticated once and we do any
number transactions

193
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,170
and we do just a a little bit o now head

194
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,140
that build an effort here in there to
make sure that the tools are connecting

195
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,769
in think they're talking to a normal SMB
server

196
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:09,360
but they're not actually can I think a
risking it passed directly on into that

197
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,670
connection

198
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,320
and so it turns out we can have any
number as inbound connections we have

199
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,019
any number sessions are maintaining

200
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,010
and we can swap out any those
authenticated sessions we possess

201
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,630
and connect our tools into them assess
it you can see the demo

202
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,880
if you look at it on the left there we
just have remember there are times are

203
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,760
different ways

204
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,649
that you can get it to this situation
bottom and middle attacks lotta name

205
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:33,920
poisoning attacks

206
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,570
and the still happen all the time

207
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,029
so demo time and hopefully

208
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,380
me missed a merengue

209
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:49,430
yes school so

210
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,250
have LX machine here as just a a basic
Ali

211
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,310
tools written in node so if you install
node a

212
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,589
then no you can discredit forget how
we'll get to that in a sec

213
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:04,079
I we have two boxes here's Alice now
it's our seven cuz I'll seven hours XP

214
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,839
but it seems like seven would be better
for demo

215
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,550
and then I've gotta Bob seven they're
both members of the domain

216
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,839
I we can look at I'm logged in at the
Josh a domain

217
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,000
and my user name is Josh up

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,180
so first we have to establish a
successful

219
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,740
man the middle or name poisoning
scenario gotten are poisoning running

220
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,040
here in the background

221
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,779
%uh so got these two machines routing
through my box

222
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:33,389
prerequisite for men the middle for the
the name poisoning I will talk a little

223
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:36,300
bit about what's new different in that
situation

224
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,670
but anyway so the tool itself

225
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,019
up as CAC all-star and it does a couple
things one it binds to

226
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:47,470
your IP address and anything that comes

227
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,700
in it's going to service that connection

228
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,760
we use IP tables to do and some other
rewriting

229
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,810
for connections are coming through so
this run this I have a bye into my IP

230
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,420
their few the other options we're going
to what those are about in a minute but

231
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,130
when star starts it creates a chain an
IP tables called star

232
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,110
and then it tells you hey in order for
this to work you have to you

233
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,680
run this IP tables rule at res we have
that in their right now at least

234
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,209
is because you may not necessarily want
immediately everything coming through

235
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:20,089
you may want to modify that rule

236
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:24,290
if you're on a humongous subnet with
lots of SMB you may only want to single

237
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,370
out certain systems are playing by the
rules

238
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,639
at before you start servicing these
connections how so

239
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,899
and if I in

240
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,950
now so I've got and hopefully that's
probably terrible spot to have it on the

241
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,860
screen

242
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,839
um so here hacked client at

243
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,649
so the the star chain all it does is it
logs a connection coming in

244
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:50,519
that lets us identify what its source IP
and port is and what its destination IP

245
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,889
and port is so we know what to connect
to

246
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:56,730
on you talk more about that at later if
you have questions are how that really

247
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,529
works but

248
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,610
I hear it is taking anything on for four
forty-five and we're

249
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,360
a sending it over to the star change and
that's gonna end up being adding it

250
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,990
locally so it goes in tr2 let's address
at Southern the network Lee works

251
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,149
so what's this is running all I need to
do is have

252
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:16,769
some session come through my routing so
from Alice will just do something real

253
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:17,420
simple

254
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,019
in I actually I think

255
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,760
Bob 7 orders to see dollars I am mad
men.

256
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,170
sir drives he is now connected so and

257
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,430
I'll show you in a minute but this is a
fully functional

258
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,320
connection I'm not doing anything evil
yet is still quite innocuous

259
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,420
but over here we can see that's not
gives us a little bit about put

260
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,980
as we can see for example now we got a
connection from this IP

261
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,089
I we look at the kernel are we found out
where it's going and

262
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:50,380
so we have a TV hit we're gonna make a
new connection out a poet it's trying to

263
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,019
communicate with SMB too and we hate

264
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:56,529
SMB 2 because all our tools don't use it
so we're gonna scrub SMB too so it won't

265
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,709
negotiate at all

266
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,720
downgraded to one and then we can see
just the

267
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,870
transaction traffics do that S&P session
but

268
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,449
as cool is that is we give you a little
bit more an easier way to look at things

269
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,440
your own local web-based interface for
you can see all the connections that you

270
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,199
have

271
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,329
actually we can do common

272
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:19,540
and I Allison

273
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,079
can type in lots of people are watching

274
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:26,160
yeah so that if I have bacchanal we'll
see another one are here

275
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,279
hand this'll this'll f11 over time as we
poison names are get more connections

276
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,480
routing through us

277
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,449
and we can see information now at a worn
yet every other time I run this

278
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:40,519
it'll use Kerberos or they'll use NTLM
to authenticate

279
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:43,290
I can't really control that it becomes
earth entail and then we know what the

280
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,519
user name is an avid

281
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,750
that would show in these fields here and
also will give you the hash it's unknown

282
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,880
here cuz Kerberos

283
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,860
we decided to see that stuff but its NT
land will give you exactly the line you

284
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,300
need to pop it into hash cat or
something like that to try to crack it

285
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,639
if you want to

286
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,600
%uh button see all season it's been 82
seconds since this connection

287
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,410
last communicated on eventually

288
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,360
that connection will finish in even if I
do this

289
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,220
see in fight terminate that

290
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,269
it'll be a little while before that
connection actually die so for now the

291
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,259
sticks pirate

292
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:22,500
I turns out you can expire connection
and usually when does not really care

293
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
too much

294
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,839
because Windows expects these stupid to
tear down and have to re in initiate

295
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,100
them all the time

296
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,790
but once we have that connection
released

297
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,139
so that client no longer has a drive
mapping you may not use we see no

298
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,519
entries in the list

299
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,959
up and I have some other things I can do
now

300
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,100
I can choose this one and actually Ogden

301
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,959
expire at some free choose this this is
where we start the local listener

302
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:52,089
so now I have something listening on 127
there's r1 on for 45

303
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:56,290
so we can start doing some interesting
things me

304
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,380
discovery well you proficiency yup

305
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,380
so if I do an SMB client

306
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,760
I specify my username is just being and
my password is being

307
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,130
remember I was logged in as Josh at the
Josh account in the Josh a domain

308
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,620
so this is definitely not the rising
faster but doesn't matter

309
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,669
gotta 127 001 and I

310
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,329
just pick at the scene our share in see
here up at the top

311
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:25,049
we've got an hacker tool that we have
now authenticated and we see that the

312
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:28,250
hacker speaks SMB in the server response
and we're now

313
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,600
communicating in that old session that
has been given up by the client

314
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,760
and this works interactively I can do
anything that i won in here and I can

315
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,970
exit and I can start it again and I can
continue using this

316
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,549
and I can do things like in

317
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:45,640
SMB exec right

318
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,190
I'm not as an exact winning XD

319
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,690
everybody's watchin and I'm

320
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:58,299
hair some like that in

321
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:01,740
so there you can see had another
connection and from hacker tool

322
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,880
and here running as the Josh account

323
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,110
so what if it as we're going along I'm
having a really fun contests I decide to

324
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,630
Josh account though interesting

325
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,650
in this case it is actually domain admin
but what if I do

326
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,710
another connection here to Bob 7

327
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,980
see dollar in services

328
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,070
service1 because I have excellent
passwords in my

329
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,799
target then

330
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,900
so now if we hop over ha cool I did

331
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,690
in Tijuana thing so now we have a third
connection here from the services

332
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,080
account

333
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,669
and we can see a little bit information
about this system as you have these

334
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:41,570
running for you get

335
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,780
a few tens or hundreds of them and a
it's really helpful to have some %uh

336
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,799
this data

337
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,059
there there's our hasher and healing be
to negotiation if we want to try to

338
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:49,730
crack that

339
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,919
you can pop that directly into ascap up

340
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,620
but the now if I exit here and then

341
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,880
I expire that

342
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,570
and then choose that in then I can

343
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,929
connect again and who am i i'm services
now I'm not Josh I can hop back and

344
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,289
forth between these connections

345
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,400
I get as many as we want and use them in
reuse them

346
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,130
and what it means is if these aren't
local admins are domain admins its okay

347
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,700
cuz I can still look at the shares I can
still get information from registry

348
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,700
I get install suffer manifest maybe from
I'll

349
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,250
a couple different had techniques so you
end up doing quite a bit with this

350
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,460
and it makes this a much more useful
thing they just kinda

351
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,200
hope it happens and we get our
interpreter

352
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,030
yes so let's see with that we'll go back
to you

353
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,450
non demo so

354
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,950
do this kinda quickly are few things we
have to do to make it work

355
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,299
I one is sessions diet pretty often cool

356
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:55,130
and as so we have to set some SMB
options your talk about that but let us

357
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:55,480
know

358
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,770
we talked about it afterwards but the
session stay around for a while I've had

359
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,230
the last up to like 16 hours

360
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,280
which a normal S&P connection I T that's
we do a little bit a magic in there to

361
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,880
make that work

362
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,159
and then we got six minutes so

363
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,289
other protocols any protocol that is
probably unencrypted did

364
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:17,340
supports multiple transactions one
connection and authenticates at the

365
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,350
beginning

366
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,240
and doesn't have any message
authentication a Lisa subtilis we have

367
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,679
working code for MySQL

368
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,230
does the same thing no water protocols
at work like this just happens

369
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,480
we're doing with SMB right now because
it's really helpful

370
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,520
to mitigate it your turn on SMB signing

371
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,559
that's perfect as a place last week that
had SMB signing turned on and so

372
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,200
as I got lotsa lotsa sessions everywhere
they were absolutely useless to me

373
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,429
other protocols as a lad that the last
SL

374
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,909
Center at certainly help we've got a few
things like

375
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:51,409
round-robin feature we did very recently
where you get a list if I peace

376
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:54,929
and every inbound connection it'll send
it to a different server see get enough

377
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:57,360
for these things coming for you have
hundreds of sessions

378
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,700
and you just keep going to you get a
machine without user's local admin

379
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,909
and UN at you get this on our

380
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,620
I get up get up back on size purple team
slashed are good

381
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,700
works on Cali after install node at and
with that

382
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,700
questions I think we've got four minutes
right

383
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,250
cool

384
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:26,990
I no question this

385
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,059
the most i've seen. was about 200 is
actually usability hundreds is a few

386
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:32,480
weeks ago

387
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,760
serious hungry room all words

388
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,090
gathered in the tool has worked really
well and

389
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,360
in three compromises that I've had the
last month or so

390
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,309
I N it just turns out add you get one
account

391
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:49,380
that might be regularly a laminar in or
something like that every

392
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,140
every three minutes you get three
sessions if a round-robin ing that

393
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,789
that means after an hour you know I have
what is at 12 times the Act I for forty

394
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:58,720
sessions

395
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,770
with that and and as if I pick my target
IP as well

396
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,059
out assist it may be a matter of time
until I get a local admin with that

397
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:11,370
and then if I find any virus gets in the
way i can. attempt multiple payloads do

398
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,460
but a different things to get it to work

399
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,440
so it turns out to be helpful for
exploration and discovery but also

400
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,830
helpful for exploitation and privilege
escalation to

401
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:26,820
I ended sent tens or hundreds quite
effectively for me so far

402
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:33,140
there lame thing

403
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,919
yes oh element R&B an ass you're telling
them to connect to you

404
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:40,150
so the comes into my IP I don't know
where to relate

405
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,870
so you have to specify default target
cities either specify one

406
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,039
and the interfacing actually change that
dynamically that we did a round robin

407
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,039
workers to

408
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:55,039
a big list about peace so

409
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:02,220
don't know don't know that it is very
very very different heard you talking

410
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,320
about it for Metasploit know they're
grappling with that

411
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,330
problem our solution is downgrade

412
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,210
and other tools work with it downgrading
I mean all the

413
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,760
at all we do is an S&P space 2.0

414
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,900
dialect Weeden turn that into bogus and
nothing will ever negotiate SMB 2 it'll

415
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,100
always go back up to

416
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,700
as anyone sir

417
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,960
cool I think we're all set thanks

418
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,580
are things going on
