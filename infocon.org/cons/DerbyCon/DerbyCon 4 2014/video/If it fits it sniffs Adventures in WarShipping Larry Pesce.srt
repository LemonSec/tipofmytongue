invited to come speak at Derby Conn

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,559
I M E penetration tester and hardware
hacker

12
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,219
I had a very small boutique and testing
firm called in guardians

13
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:49,420
I love those guys I'm also a certified
Santa structure where I teach their

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,570
wireless class

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,809
security 617 penetration testing in

16
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:58,710
defending wireless networks I also a
member of the Paul security weekly crew

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,160
the formally pollack on security weekly
podcast now Paul security weekly podcast

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,920
here don't ask

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,540
there is money in copyright issues
involved

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,770
and it was up all night it started the
the podcast were pushin

21
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,880
7 years ago and has been a weekly thing

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,900
from there on I am also a an extra class
ham radio operator

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,930
with Michael sign up to be one TNF

24
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,530
cue a brother want anger the former fox
trot or if you think you wanna be funny

25
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,880
its I Kevin Bacon won that's not funny

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,450
alright so let's talk about some this

27
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,250
this whole worshiping stuff we're having
a discussion in the office

28
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,600
and we're all virtual sold was the
office otherwise known as the IRC

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,150
channel where we all hang out all day

30
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,020
on we're talking about potentially
delivering a wifi

31
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,280
hacking platform to one of our customers

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,940
and then we thought about this what if
we're going to do this is ethical Penn

33
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,670
testers

34
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,600
why can't someone else who is less than
at the Gold do something very similar

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,790
I'm so promotion otherwise we had some
things that we wanted to accomplish as

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,510
part of this

37
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,770
harm we want to be able to no one key a
drive to the appropriate location or

38
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,550
very close

39
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,370
we wanted to know one specific networks
were in range

40
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,130
so that we could potentially launch
attacks make sure that we were

41
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,959
were attacking the right folks wanted
deal with the issues over how long does

42
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,140
it take to get there

43
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,630
and maybe what can we do I when it's in
transit

44
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,970
so let's start talking about something
else so

45
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,610
I am thinking about this a little
differently okay my wife

46
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,350
loves the slide no on this whole thing
about sir doing

47
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,630
arm wifi typeof attacks has been done so
it's

48
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,560
it's not that this is terribly different
but sum up the output ended up being a

49
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,820
little bit different and we took a
different set of

50
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,360
a a different approach to some other
challenges that we've seen

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,660
so this whole wifi discovery a taxing
has broadened been done

52
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,670
were airplane in ballooning biking
walking

53
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,060
you name it on in fact this whole
land-based shipping carrier has actually

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,769
been done

55
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,030
Dave meaner and I Robert Graham did this
in

56
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,130
at DEFCON 16 it was right after the
iPhone one came out

57
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,730
hand they actually I heard Joe broke
their

58
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,950
iPhone and ship this in the mail the
problem is is that

59
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,200
their results ended up being kinda odd
because on their way from the airport

60
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,630
to that Riviera for DEFCON actually lost
the phone in a cab

61
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,690
so no I didn't lose my device

62
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,530
in a cab so that be actually potentially
have

63
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,050
day at the end results from the state
stuff so wanna definitely give credit to

64
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,010
to rob agreement a mentor for some

65
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,380
their their works during summer this
this worshiping stop again

66
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,560
I took a little bit different approach
to some of these things

67
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,840
re: so let's think about sort of what
the end game is

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,860
we want to get the device into a
facility to

69
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,020
discover information about their
wireless networks and potentially

70
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,569
deliver attacks we want this device to
be there to do something for a certain

71
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:04,569
period of time

72
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,890
so with this is a fairly large sort of a
silly

73
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:11,890
I'm were often gonna find that all the
packages get delivered to one spot

74
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,959
and then their internal mail room now
hold on to the packages and distributes

75
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,299
from within the company and that's
actually potentially good for us

76
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:23,430
now we're going to the package delivered
is gonna sit there for maybe one or two

77
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,240
days

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,760
inside a facility that has those
wireless networks I'll

79
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,750
in them time where they're gonna be
taking this in delivering these of

80
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,610
thanks Dave

81
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:39,610
good I was thirsty anyways

82
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:48,260
no it's not

83
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:04,039
the how

84
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,599
man there's another one and they're
gonna come up later who thanks Dave

85
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:13,840
up a backrub alright so

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,659
we can now potentially extend the time
for the link that this package will sit

87
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:18,419
in the mailroom

88
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,979
and send it to a person who doesn't
exist so by a vet virtual that senator

89
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,349
person that doesn't exist in the
company's

90
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,759
a similar maybe for a couple days to the
figure out that this person doesn't work

91
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,250
here

92
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,370
and then maybe they ship it back to us
awesome now we can potentially recover

93
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:32,990
some data

94
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,000
maybe we send it to someone who's on
vacation so gets delivered to their

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,680
office

96
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,500
mother on vacation and it's it's in
their office for

97
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,389
a week two weeks continually gathering
information potential launching attacks

98
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:45,620
against that type stuff

99
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,460
on some other type of things maybe we
deliver this to someone that has

100
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,279
huh inconveniently just been terminated

101
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,339
maybe the post on Twitter hey I just got
fired I just but my job today you ship

102
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:58,270
it to them and then

103
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,529
maybe takes a while for the mail room to
get that router someone else

104
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,629
some other things to think about is that
maybe we have

105
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:09,460
someone that we want to attack it is on
the path above one of the shipping

106
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:09,899
routes

107
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,199
when we don't actually ship it to the
company but

108
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,319
we send it to a UPS or I

109
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,110
FedEx facility that is very close to the
company where we can observe that so

110
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,219
maybe it's a long one at the shipping
routes

111
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:25,500
we don't even need to send it to the
victim company they have no idea that

112
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,599
this thing ends up in there

113
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,419
in their environment but we ship it
passed and that becomes kinda

114
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,839
interesting to see how can we can
potentially have

115
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,779
um multiple paths and then of course if
we end up

116
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,710
maybe making some mistakes and shipping
or the something's changed

117
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,509
what happens when this gets put on an
airplane as opposed to doing ground

118
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:45,149
transport

119
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:49,629
so that also become some some free
different changes see

120
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:54,199
I told you was coming her alright so get
that the aircraft

121
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,509
maybe some specific issues given that
the FAA and and weather and all that

122
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:01,029
have suffered a change bypass

123
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,430
so up that also may be interesting as
well now there's also some other

124
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,399
challenges about

125
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,330
I'm doing electronics on airplanes
alright

126
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,120
so great Center the catnip

127
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,629
nice n Easy my friends alright so who
are some other potential victims for EPA

128
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:22,889
worshiping attack are so one the the
recipient going to send it to a victim

129
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,009
and have to be in their facility

130
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,539
we can send it passed to them in in a
trucker local delivery

131
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:31,029
order shipped across country couple
times issue we can find

132
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:35,279
all or the shipping companies themselves
is that might become interested now they

133
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,490
have wifi and some

134
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,690
their facilities in local distribution
places in those cent rise places in our

135
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,909
potential your shipping

136
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:46,360
on some WiFi devices through company
that is

137
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,019
you know we're specifying which carrier
use in potentially launch attacks

138
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:50,649
against them

139
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:55,440
okay we've got a couple love different
options for shipping companies

140
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,860
I here in the US this summer big ones
FedEx UPS

141
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,440
United States Postal Service I DHL maybe

142
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,589
we're going to be pen testing career
service in one large

143
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:10,699
a cities so now we can potentially do
last mile for some worker your services

144
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,800
as well and we're gonna end up with
those packages in their facilities

145
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,159
because they're doing the transport for
so that's one potential attack targets

146
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:18,649
force

147
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:23,199
K when we start specifically talking
about ground transportation that last

148
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,810
mile was all sorts of fun

149
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,189
you know that FedEx truck drives around
your neighborhood and drops of packages

150
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:31,229
help maybe now you're attacking how much
networks in

151
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:34,529
residential areas in the war in some I

152
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,260
office parks in some of those tend to
think so that that's slow circle last

153
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,209
mile type stuff that stops frequently

154
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:45,149
that can have some extra fun stuff force
we can also potentially ship this

155
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,430
between two places

156
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,140
a being able to potentially find someone
in transit

157
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,790
I mean we're able to determine that one
other frequent shipping pass

158
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,579
that one of the carrier's uses goes by
our facility a high speed on highway we

159
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,329
were getting enough

160
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:03,560
their maybe potentially between to
distribution places

161
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,740
or potentially in last mile if you can
get last mile

162
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,860
it's a significantly slower transport
method more options

163
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,300
and more possibility for us to have that
shipping

164
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,630
device with our tax in it closer to the
facility

165
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,260
the problem that we may end up having is
called multipass

166
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,149
when we talk where a spot where signal
taking multiple routes to a destination

167
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,350
we could still have the same problem we
doing shipping is the

168
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,350
shipping transport wetherbee last mile
or

169
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,420
between distribution to distribution
center always going to be the same

170
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,640
and that will vary depending on who the
driver is

171
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,459
I who the a which the carrier is

172
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,959
where the traffic situations whether you
name it as to how they're actually gonna

173
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,990
do that

174
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,260
as well so we may have ship 200 packages
to do test for location

175
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,390
and then that one time that we actually
deliver the attack it may take a

176
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,850
different route because it's something
beyond our control

177
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,540
so trying to find someone at multi-path
stuff is interesting

178
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,839
alright so sure all the L it's gonna end
up at the place where we want to

179
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,990
there are potentially multiple ways to
get there

180
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,020
based on traffic construction some

181
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,089
multiple ways that we may want to have a
tractor-trailer truck drive

182
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:19,439
cross-country

183
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:22,890
airplanes you name it so we have some
issues there a

184
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,500
the last mile also becomes interesting
to you if you think about serve

185
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,199
how those folks deal with the the last
mile

186
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:33,860
I see the FedEx and UPS truck drive up
and down my street all day long work

187
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,010
from home

188
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,140
but one some days he's going northbound
on the other days is going southbound

189
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,959
and it all depends on his route
depending on where he's delivering

190
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:42,600
packages

191
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,220
so that path for last miles potentially
going to change

192
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,600
great this is a really interesting
package I'm not sure exactly what's

193
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,649
happening there

194
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,069
I am but this is this sort is a no
brainer for the

195
00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:00,529
recipient for the attack on the problem
is is that

196
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,589
I know when i receive a package it's
usually like

197
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:07,110
oh my gosh christmastime blue it's my
birthday I got all sorts of fun stuff

198
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,809
I'm gonna open it right away

199
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:12,670
on near even if it was something for
work I was hit in the box because that

200
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,309
means I got toys

201
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:18,110
a and so now we're potentially going to
get discovered so we have to start

202
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,480
dealing with some others other options
for getting that left in the facility

203
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,829
for I'm for some period of time

204
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:28,649
the question really becomes ever going
to start launching attacks or

205
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:29,550
determining

206
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,189
this path based stuff is where the
finale right

207
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:37,689
where in the heck are we and when do we
know how to launch these attacks

208
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:42,069
on being able to you determine some %uh
this type of stuff in transit

209
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:46,730
has some some issues great now once
we're done one of the primary

210
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,350
piece is a software that I'm using for
my solution is kismet sure when we go

211
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,130
write our own kismet plugin to deal with
latitude longitude location

212
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,319
on specific as a side these BS societies
that show up

213
00:11:57,319 --> 00:12:00,339
and then launch are attacks based on
that judgment forget

214
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,980
sure I don't have this done and there's
a reason for that will get to read that

215
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,270
was reason

216
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,420
so we took a different approach to this
problem

217
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,959
K we wanted infinite power I'm so we
didn't ship for standards are based

218
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,130
%uh iPhone Android phone any of those
such things

219
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,569
we wanted to build our own custom
solution because if you think about it

220
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:23,770
was the cost of

221
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,149
fairly modern iPhone or an Android
device

222
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:30,720
a couple hundred bucks and if that
doesn't come back to me

223
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,970
well that tends to be a expensive
proposition especially if I have to do

224
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,929
smoke but I'm

225
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,380
so we wanted a inexpensive solution that
if it got lost

226
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,459
welp I'm based on potentially

227
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,029
developing some love this this custom
solution we had some significant

228
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,540
challenges

229
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,649
re: so we had some challenges with a
stock solution grief

230
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,420
its gonna battery from the battery life

231
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,519
is not that great we have an add some
other batteries

232
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,679
their potentially expensive what's the
cost to the

233
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,920
mobile device I the size is great

234
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,329
okay his you know we put in a really
small box maybe with some additional

235
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:10,309
batteries as well

236
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:16,209
and it's already got GPS built-in also
unfortunately at the cost a battery life

237
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:19,250
using on with a custom-built solution

238
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,850
from we can make the battery life as
good or as poor as we want and I will

239
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,800
show you some of that

240
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,890
coming up here what we can do this very
inexpensive

241
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:32,419
I'm with some off-the-shelf hardware I
we can make this as large or as small as

242
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:33,549
we want to

243
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:37,169
depending on battery size as well the
problem is

244
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:41,589
we run into GPS there's no GPS currently
we have to add it on our own

245
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:44,650
and if you think about the way GPS is
going to work force

246
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,360
let's go take a GPS parked it is your
needs to have a pretty good

247
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,939
view of the sky and then put that inside
above

248
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:55,150
metal tractor-trailer truck what does
that do

249
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,270
returns on that radio at high power

250
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,429
when I can see this guy tries to obtain
satellite signal

251
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:04,480
and then it comes out to the truck goes
into the big metal warehouse

252
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,299
it does the same thing and then it gets
in the the UPS FEDEX and which is also

253
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:11,939
metal and doesn't have a clear view the
skies are turned the radio on high power

254
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:15,500
and there goes your battery life so when
we were

255
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,559
server working on the solution from
there is some

256
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,159
definite issues with hey we put this
really low power

257
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,380
low power draw GPS park on it an hour
battery life

258
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,480
when right in the toilet was horrible so
we had some issues about dealing with

259
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,850
some of the hardware so what we did a

260
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,319
or created our own solution

261
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:41,549
I am which happens to be in this
priority mail box

262
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,939
okay we leveraged the Raspberry Pi
B-plus

263
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:47,959
which is significantly less power drain
I

264
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,760
alfa-2b US 051 NH card so does a/b/g/n
support

265
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,130
he charger and voltage converter which
was repurposed from

266
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:02,169
the device I am to charge battery packs
and I think that paid a dollar twenty

267
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,679
four from dealextreme

268
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,809
arm but you'll note know where that
there is a GPS

269
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:10,640
on this day

270
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,490
turner's on and I added the ability for
us to do

271
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,929
voltage monitoring so this is gonna turn
on we're gonna fire

272
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:22,520
kismet and its gonna start finding that
works in and start walking some other

273
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,549
stuff as well

274
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,939
when it's finally power to all the way
up it'll drop out

275
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:31,309
442 430 million aP's with wireless
adapter on

276
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:34,130
I'm currently with the the battery set
up and talk a little bit about the

277
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,289
batteries as well

278
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:39,209
a this will run for a hundred and four
and a half hours

279
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:42,530
with some fairly modest better
calculation

280
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:47,110
gets a really good thing that with the
United States Postal Service box

281
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,819
that its a flattery because this thing
is heavy

282
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:55,030
I mean there are some 30 a 18 650
batteries

283
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,329
on this thing and this is lots of fun on

284
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:01,839
TSA had lots of fun when I brought all
these batteries in my checked bag

285
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,069
on I so I spent a couple days in Las
Vegas for work right before coming here

286
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:10,589
the airport in Providence when I flew to
Vegas had no issue

287
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:15,250
but when I had the red eye from Vegas
here arm the TSA agent

288
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,260
gave me the third degree and it'll
special rubber glove treatment because I

289
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,159
had forty

290
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,500
up these batteries in my carry-on bag
because you can't put lithium-ion

291
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,939
batteries on the plane

292
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:28,079
side carry Manya they didn't like that
for some reason I can imagine

293
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,720
okay so we're just about done booting up
and I were bouncing back and forth

294
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,980
between

295
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,159
$450 million absent 430 million aP's

296
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:40,990
so it's probably still doing a little
bit up so on the back there is

297
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,990
wireless adapter and raspberry pie
people's

298
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,959
yes the virus adapter doesn't have a
case on it when it came in

299
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:51,329
there were two screws in the case and it
basically just fell off so-called

300
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:52,900
control fail on that one

301
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,669
so obviously the case of

302
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:00,919
alright so yes size matters

303
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:06,199
K so not all this shipping boxes from
the various carriers are the same size

304
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:11,029
I designed to this one to fit in the
smallest about the same size boxes

305
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:14,679
we can I just add some extra shipping
material around that its on a piece a

306
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:15,789
Plexiglas that i cud

307
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:20,010
on my table saw no for the workshop and
drilled holes into a cap

308
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,510
has a handle which I didn't around the
edges on handle

309
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,059
and when I had to carry the five blocks
over from the SpringHill Suites this

310
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:26,850
morning

311
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,429
4 sock he was digging into my hand
pretty bad

312
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:35,830
up I you know UPS has the largest town
tractor box about the size from the the

313
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,640
United States Postal Service the United
States Postal Service pics

314
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,270
fixed-rate medium sized box is the
smallest in class

315
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,710
are so I went for the the smallest size

316
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,360
K so more power right so

317
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,659
size matters that's what she said and
what if I told you that's not what she

318
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:54,570
said

319
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,120
K so the large the package the more
battery we can put in it

320
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,600
in the case have the the 1i brought with
me there is one sleeve so to speak

321
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,070
there's no reason I couldn't added yet
another sleeve to this box

322
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,360
we have just batters and potentially
triple

323
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,370
the the battery life so 104 and a half
hours

324
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,559
with the current 30 batteries I am but
potentially we can now

325
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,990
pull that in two to three hundred our
range by just adding more batteries to

326
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,950
the same box

327
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,480
these batteries were again we want to do
this really inexpensively

328
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,100
their lithium-ion rechargeable 18 650
batteries

329
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,760
which I pulled for free

330
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,730
for you ask normally these things about
shoe dollars apiece for the $220 million

331
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,270
power batteries from China

332
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,600
but if so I happened to go to one of my
all the players to

333
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,990
say hi to so my former coworkers and I
noticed the front desk at the admin

334
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,919
assistant us there's a box that says

335
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,049
batteries for recycling marched a
curiosity I look in and there's a bunch

336
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:57,419
old laptop batteries go some other all
Dell laptop batteries and some other new

337
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:01,909
laptop batteries they have these 18 650
cells in them in half the reason why

338
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,520
people are recycling the batteries

339
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,179
one's cell lot of maybe 12 is bad which
pulls down the voltage for the entire

340
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,620
pack

341
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,179
there if there's 12 cells in their
wondered she was bad

342
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:17,140
great goal rip it apart carefully gonna
cut yourself and then poll all the cells

343
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,169
out find the ones that are still good

344
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:22,760
and pave gotta pay for them because
they're free in this case

345
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,760
they actually had to pay to have these
batteries recycle

346
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,289
but they're doing the right thing so by
me removing these from there

347
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:32,740
recycle bin that was less that they had
to pay for

348
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,230
and then I can take those to my local
are recycling center

349
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,690
and not have to pay for them for the bad
cells so

350
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,940
that was pretty darn good up I ended up
having to build this device

351
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,320
for Derby Conn so there's a couple
things that I

352
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,690
have not been completed which can have
some definite safety things

353
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,929
here are so wonders say thank you to

354
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,010
one with former coworkers RJ radcliffe
and

355
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,299
some a items that have come out of their
rest IT project

356
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,830
by Alex eames on J designed

357
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,330
he a power circuit for us to be able to
deal

358
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,679
with some a power issues for this device

359
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,039
if you pull the battery voltage down on
these batteries too far they will start

360
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:17,870
to go

361
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,309
again to destroy themselves modem no
longer work

362
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,500
I am so we wanna when the voltage dips
to

363
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,580
a certain level we want to power off the
device so we don't destroy your

364
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,760
batteries

365
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,899
%ah the a.m. automatically shut down the
device save the batteries

366
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:37,159
some other options too is that he has
the ability for the circuit to

367
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:40,760
do some thermal monitoring so if the
device gets too hot

368
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,450
we can shut that off and potentially a
avoid

369
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,179
lithium-ion battery temperature runaway
which

370
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,610
when that goes too far those lithium-ion
batteries

371
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,880
catch on fire and if you guys ever seen
a lithium fire

372
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,760
thats very the energetic and

373
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,830
think about that sitting on an the
believe an airplane

374
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,779
which is why you have to carry them on
with you of or in a tractor-trailer

375
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:05,480
truck

376
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,270
for going cross-country this is not
something that you want to have happen

377
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,080
to be blamed for

378
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,220
so we're working on that as well

379
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,890
K so we've noticed that there is no GPS
on

380
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,990
on this whole solution K real time GPS
would be killer at the problem is is it

381
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,480
affects battery life

382
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,049
a we too much we took that 104

383
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:31,240
.5 hour battery pack down to about
thirty three hours

384
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,730
and in some cases depending on where was
located even less

385
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,980
that's not very much time especially for
shipping this thing potentially

386
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,590
cross-country UPS Ground something I've
like

387
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,039
no word financially talking a week worth
irv

388
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,659
better requirements 210 plus hours

389
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:51,649
so reducing it that far using a real
time GPS

390
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:57,510
becomes a problem K so how do we deal
with some that more people talk about

391
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,679
summer the other software that we used a
was

392
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,160
kismet with just strictly XML output

393
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,650
I am there for the small for you to
process our talk about some to tools for

394
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,929
being able to do with that

395
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,690
I did not capture P caps because the

396
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,080
writing up the key caps is significantly
larger truth has more battery

397
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,330
requirement to

398
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,750
write those two sd card now we're talkin
fairly large SD card

399
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,860
or external USB which is going to then

400
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,490
at more power and many the cases I just
want to know where this device has been

401
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,120
as opposed to actually capturing lots of
traffic

402
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,050
a that the traffic depending on that
trip across country may not be

403
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,420
I interesting to me so I elected not to
capture

404
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,620
P caps attacks are currently sorted
limited again we haven't written that

405
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,690
the kismet plug in to be able to do that

406
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,650
I do we want to have a second network
are to be able to deliver those attacks

407
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,230
and now we're potentially talking a some
additional power requirements

408
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,970
the big one again is location how do we
deal with some a location stuff

409
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,030
so how do we do GPS with a-gps well

410
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,160
quite nicely we can't unless we do some
potential post-processing

411
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,550
we get the SD card back with arc is
maximal plugins

412
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:16,610
are output on it we can now potentially
go on find where all these access points

413
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,440
were discovered

414
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,309
in transit even though we had no GPS

415
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:27,559
up because someone knows where all these
argue they're based on their SSID their

416
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,820
network name or their be SSID their
wireless mac Address

417
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,050
so someone knows where these devices are
on

418
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,559
week it was one of those places that
that knows where these are both

419
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,760
based on the SSID an SSID the problem
that I have

420
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,980
with legal is that is all user submitted
it is

421
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,390
not in real time and some other cases
the information is quite dated

422
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,010
my understanding is that they haven't
dumped the database

423
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,340
since they started so the it said

424
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,090
very large pieces of history in time and
the information in the areas that you

425
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,520
wanna only as good as the last
submission

426
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,070
and that lasts a mission may have been
three or four years ago so we're based

427
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,440
on

428
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,910
on what users are submitting however if

429
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,150
you don't think that the big names like
Google and Apple

430
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,570
don't know where some of the stuff is
from your mobile device

431
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:22,160
I have an iPhone turn on my iPhone it
says if using location-based services

432
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,700
it can be better if you turn on your
wifi why

433
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,450
because they're listening to all the
Access Point names and BS aside these

434
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,100
for all the stuff that are around and
putting those in a database in comparing

435
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,500
that with the GPS latitude longitude

436
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,850
so they can do finer accuracy with all
that stuff they know about this stuff

437
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,090
so why don't we ask them K great

438
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,350
so I am big thanks to the I sniffed GPS
project

439
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,110
I'm who work with a bunch of other folks
I to you

440
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,490
I work with and undocumented Apple API
call

441
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,760
VHD p to be able to take the

442
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,860
the SSID a wireless mac address
inquiries Apple and have it returned

443
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,190
four hundred low-key

444
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:07,870
400 access points and their locations so
that now we can have the Mapple 400

445
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,900
access points well for my purposes I
don't want

446
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:15,100
of order to access points in their
locations I just want one

447
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,000
K so that kismet XML output

448
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,630
has everything we need even if it
doesn't have the latitude longitude it

449
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,799
has an SSID it has a network name

450
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,429
and has the wireless mac address that we
can now query potentially in combination

451
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:33,799
up both Apple using their undocumented
API calls for their database

452
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,250
as well as an SSID we can populate some
maps as well

453
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,400
not so I took upon my first place on
project

454
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,010
a and unfortunately due to time
constraints summer these are the last

455
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,429
mile stuff I had some

456
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:49,620
some help from so my coworkers Jay
Radcliffe and I worked on this

457
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,770
officially in we've done a bunch more
work to it since then

458
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,530
but I wanted to take sort of my approach
to learning Python very much like

459
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,320
mister Dave Kennedy did and Dave
Kennedy's first Python project was set

460
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,320
and you see how that is turned off
pretty damn cool so

461
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,370
hopefully have some pretty damn cool but
some stuff by the time we're done

462
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,429
so the tool that we're going to release
are releasing

463
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:15,610
I will read in kismet XML put

464
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,990
by read all the BS aside EV where smack
addresses

465
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,260
and queer you look Apple with their
undocumented

466
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,540
API call retrieve the location and then
populate the Google map

467
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,820
so now we can start seeing these on on a
path

468
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,250
I and that largely leverages some other
the libraries for those undocumented API

469
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,850
calls

470
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:40,200
from the ice if GPS project and now
we've got that hosted up on get help

471
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,049
we have a couple changes that we're
ready to check in for some improvements

472
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:46,090
but didn't want to break into the demos

473
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,530
alright so let's tempt the unicorn

474
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:54,630
K so let's see if we can actually do a
demo here

475
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:01,630
and yes I cheated alright so we're going
to take

476
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,160
a her okay so doesn't have

477
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,870
a filepath its ask for some help

478
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,240
it wants I location %uh your kismet XML

479
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,960
and where what the file name you want to
write the map

480
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,230
and judge you automatically want to open
the results in a web browser

481
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,929
so I'm gonna give its he a your location
for

482
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:29,179
an XML gonna output that to Derby Conn
HTML and is now attempting to

483
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:33,770
I go out to Apple find a bunch of BS
aside these from that XML

484
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,200
creating Apple for location and
populates those on a map

485
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,270
and I miss radcliffe for you here

486
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:44,429
no because he will recognize this
because this

487
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:51,429
is some access points right around his
house

488
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,510
I won't tell you which three lives on a
but it will now start populating

489
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,429
the map with access points and if we
hover over those gives us the

490
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,679
societies as well now this is a small
sample so that you guys can

491
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,980
sir sir see this happen it goes fairly
quickly but we can start

492
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,270
running I am significantly larger
samples

493
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,480
arm that one was only a couple K if we
do it with

494
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,960
a mmm this sample this one

495
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,160
is some user submitted samples ask for
some

496
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,630
on Twitter this when someone who did
award drive from

497
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,080
a see image what airport code is that

498
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,070
columbus ohio to atlanta are so they
were drove the entire trip

499
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,750
on and didn't if there's the GPS
latitude longitude is in the file but

500
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,049
still we can do that by

501
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,309
the SSID as well this file was

502
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:45,620
89 make the first one was a couple K

503
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,070
I'm so I'm probably to stop this cuz
this is going to be you know highly

504
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,270
I'll not fun cuz gonna sit here for a
while especially cuz their wireless

505
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:57,040
their connection to go pulitzer from
Apple's going over my 4G

506
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:03,440
connection so we'll stop arm will see
this whole long string of stuff

507
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,410
and when I first started creating some
these maps we saw some very interesting

508
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,720
things

509
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,929
so what we did at first I am we took

510
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:17,220
some movies and I started adding a pass
so would read the XML

511
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,340
we saw this first network and will draw
line between

512
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,900
each axis point it was a as was found
well turns out it's pretty darn

513
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,799
inaccurate

514
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,320
I am and it's based on the time the
kismet saw that

515
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,080
some of the other stuff we found was
actually pretty interesting as well

516
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,429
so great let's go for go for ship go
shipper device

517
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:39,210
i retrieve the device get park is my XML
on XML output

518
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,400
and then I run the specter well

519
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,860
how do we get that XML maybe we put GSM
modem on it as well

520
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,900
and some specified intervals have a wake
up a blow that US

521
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,309
or maybe we get the package returned to
us return to sender

522
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:57,470
com mean we have a connector open
wireless network

523
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,890
and then upload that somewhere as well
but wanna make sure that we turned his

524
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,570
back office

525
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,000
so as not to affect battery life K and I
made sure that I put these things up in

526
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,400
case the demo failed

527
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,860
K so some other interesting things we
started talking about this stuff as well

528
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,880
we like a now we can do location-based
stuff without knowing what location was

529
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,370
without

530
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,190
latitude longitude without GPS so going
through Twitter

531
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,350
I'm someone posted a pretty interesting
image

532
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,710
to Twitter and about a TV show

533
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,140
that was doing some stuff with hacking
wireless networks and Michael that's

534
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,179
kinda interesting

535
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:35,520
so weird temp some are some unicorns as
seen on tv

536
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,490
are and this image came from I believe a
TV show called mafia a life

537
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,720
and this is a screen grab from from
entered playback

538
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,380
on the device and its quite clearly a
Mac and they're doing some

539
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,940
SSH thats they're stopping because it's
not going to any where appropriate

540
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,610
some sequel queries as well as having
this little bar on the Mac pull down on

541
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,929
the side that women is a min

542
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:03,370
so great I think this is Brad metallers
a

543
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,669
decoded Mafia live season 2 episode 10

544
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:10,669
but we just have these SSI deeds Cartman

545
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,120
pretty common Cisco wants go to Kenny
look public puppy net

546
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,150
red brick a mmm and iPhone have some
things you see an iPhone

547
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:24,640
but we've also got its GGL played GGL
work in GGL work 2nd floor

548
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,280
like well that's kinda interesting the
problem is we've just got an SSID

549
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,809
the Apple a.m. undocumented HPI call

550
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:38,220
only takes the virus mac Address so I've
got the name but no mac Address

551
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,299
from the screenshot well I bet legal
knows

552
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:46,049
what some of these are so what's take
the SSID and ask wiggle

553
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:49,299
if it knows what the mac Address is our
for these wireless networks and sure

554
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:51,929
enough in some cases they do

555
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:58,929
K so let's do you this

556
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,059
let's do on SSID lookup for the GGL

557
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:11,510
work and we'll do that against we go to
last legal do you know where this

558
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:16,299
wireless access point is a deal with the
BS ideas shirt and take the BSS ID and

559
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:18,299
then query Apple for that

560
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:22,090
we have a dash see in order for this to
work in order for us to be able to quit

561
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,150
Corey wheels database up it requires a

562
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,660
he session cooking which you can get
from your browser as authenticating

563
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,500
and I'm gonna give this session this
token away

564
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,549
it's a sad to not expire for ten years
so

565
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:39,830
go ahead and use it dance I think if I
remember correctly the reason why I'm

566
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,230
giving it away as I accidentally already
uploaded it to keep

567
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,320
get up so year

568
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,850
it's a good thing I created this account
specifically for doing this so

569
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:53,140
old R but you guys will be able to use
as you can either define this in code

570
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,990
or if you want to use your own session
cookie you can actually define this

571
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,220
sorry in the Python as well

572
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,200
K so I'll see if this will work its
gonna go query by Wiegel

573
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,780
and it is going to look for the Geo work
networks

574
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,559
I'll bring the BSS ID's the mac Address
is for those back

575
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,830
and then query apple from those
locations I could found two and gives us

576
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,840
the latitude and longitude

577
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,190
for those locations now we can of course

578
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,950
the the work to be done here's to have
it automatically open a map

579
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,200
a but we can in fact drop those

580
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,660
into a Google Maps and sure enough

581
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,710
their use a special specs warehouse
called look affects

582
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,940
at this particular address so was done
at work affects

583
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,940
precal I thought that was kinda fun

584
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,690
alright another 1i want to mention to
you that I kinda forgot

585
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,289
if you want to look up so we've got
judgment in an XML great

586
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:53,210
with a whole bunch networks but what
happens if we want to do just

587
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,620
one I'm we've also got one that just
does look up we're gonna have this

588
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,419
also add to a map um so we can just look
up a single one by

589
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:06,410
defining a mac Address with yet another
tool on the command line

590
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,280
a and this is the mac address for one of
the access points over at the SpringHill

591
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,510
Suites about five blocks from here

592
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,549
in it will again return latitude
longitude for us

593
00:34:15,549 --> 00:34:19,049
single specific PSID so

594
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:22,460
that tool will also be in ghetto great
so

595
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,740
some fun stuff on TV ya and look affects
is a special effects warehouse that was

596
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,710
dealing with all the

597
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,869
the screening for this particular attack
hubbell

598
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:34,429
this one this is a pretty interesting
screenshot

599
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:38,760
I this comes from I CBS's personal
interests

600
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,190
for those have you watched that show the
should have the computer caught hacking

601
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:47,369
aspect to that on they did a good job
they created a bunch of networks

602
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:50,450
and with that tool that they used the
OPs a kid

603
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,849
the mac Address is of for example we
look at

604
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:57,319
the classroom Barada 1951 SSID

605
00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:00,490
the mac Address is your 053 TTY

606
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:06,589
1799 QQ yeah iMac address the cannot
exist because they're not valid hacks

607
00:35:06,589 --> 00:35:11,230
I thought well what we can just brute
force all those lookups

608
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,109
home well then maybe we can actually
find out whether this is legitimate or

609
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:15,890
not

610
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:20,930
so Creek let's now

611
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,480
go do some brute force else to the short

612
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,510
surest so this will do in fact it will
go to

613
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,680
a Apple and look up

614
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,089
everyone up the a Mac sections that are
marked with an X

615
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:38,160
a brute force the entire contents
possible

616
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,440
values i'm for that I using to c6

617
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,079
cc3 of 58 and the last octet

618
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,000
our last section being all possible
values by this is also the one from the

619
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,940
SpringHill Suites down the street

620
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,910
where I'm staying and will note that we
start seeing a bunch of access points in

621
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:56,170
their

622
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,579
all in very similar locations

623
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:05,789
and multiple hopefully populated across
multiple stuff

624
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:09,720
and we start going through this and we
say hey these are all very similar to

625
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,260
all from the same manufacture

626
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,450
are all from the same sort of are run

627
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,049
and we can now determine potential
shipping patterns in and where some of

628
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:22,720
these things were distributed through
various resellers and that type of stuff

629
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,930
so some other stuff that we can do is
why don't we say

630
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,359
brute force a whole bunch the maximum
that we have the tool set to build a

631
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,339
bridge forces

632
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:37,559
are three sections the mac address so
conceivably we could brute force

633
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:40,780
all unique devices heard assigned

634
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,010
a you live for manufacture and determine
where all

635
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:48,299
their access points were installed now
to give you a nice little message

636
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:51,500
you do realize this is going to take for
ever rate arm

637
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,910
we ran one it took about eight hours so
not to make you sit here for eight hours

638
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,039
I am but it will start returning some
some pretty interesting stuff

639
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,059
I as things go along again summer

640
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:06,200
updates for the you have updates are to
be able to take

641
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,730
all this output to give his latitude
longitude and also popularly

642
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,329
some Google Maps as well so it's a it's
coming

643
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:17,599
I just ran outta time great so I thought
that was pretty neat rest now

644
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,450
potentially be able to go on brute force

645
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,589
are all possible install locations

646
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:27,710
observed by Apple devices for all sorts
various manufacturers

647
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,849
and be able to take stuff from TV and
have fun with that as well

648
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:35,299
K art so that was the demo are so we
went from

649
00:37:35,299 --> 00:37:39,380
demo 12 taunting the unicorns and then
taunting the unicorns on TV and now well

650
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:39,950
just

651
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,770
to your cards right um but of course
that is a very sexy man right there

652
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,920
thank you mister Dave Kennedy che

653
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,760
alright so now we potentially have some
benefits to some of these tools we can

654
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,349
now

655
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:57,920
perforce sequential BS aside e-zine for
specific manufactures

656
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,500
yes we are now in fact friends with
benefits

657
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,230
its so the way I finds images from my
slides

658
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,520
is I take the title the slide I at the
images after the fact that I go to

659
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,680
Google Image Search

660
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,660
and I take the title the slide pretty in
Google Image Search and picked that

661
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,339
funny image that shows up

662
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:17,789
in this happened to be the the one that
showed up sometimes it's good sometimes

663
00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:19,339
it's better

664
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:23,130
okay so

665
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:26,289
so this is an example that being bad

666
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:31,030
Cup the Sun was a someone going and
drawing GPS paths while on a run

667
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,829
and decided that they have fun and Rob
big hairy cock and balls

668
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:39,039
arm yep that's awesome isn't it

669
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,450
yet so we talk about a when I started
doing some stuff a media pass

670
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:48,170
4 some of these fairly large captures

671
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,799
are in one other case some other
user-submitted captures were couple love

672
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:54,760
years old and that's cool I need
something to test the tool with

673
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,079
so I took are all the spots and every
time it found

674
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,400
the next access point with at a spot in
the past

675
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,460
and because some of these were a little
bit older but we discovered was

676
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,160
they'd be findings access points along
Highway and then one would jump to

677
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,269
Scotland

678
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:13,670
and the next we'll come back to the
highway and then and then and then down

679
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,029
to South America

680
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:20,359
and then back and then from bike just as
they get to Atlanta this one in Boston

681
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,489
and then back almost to Atlanta and then
California

682
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:28,190
and what I surmised was happening was
because the data as captured was a

683
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,339
little bit older

684
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:32,630
and now we're actually doing sure she's
a real time

685
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,630
wearying against devices in a min
discovered that people have taken their

686
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:41,009
access points with them and put them in
a new location

687
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:44,729
from so now we can potentially track
people where they almost used to be to

688
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:46,369
where they are now

689
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:49,430
I removed the path thing just because it

690
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:53,130
took more time for processing and well
was kinda been accurate

691
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:57,769
but had some interesting output given
that we could observe that now over

692
00:39:57,769 --> 00:40:00,809
a significant period time would move to
take an access point

693
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:04,400
with them I and some others cases I
noted that they took them

694
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,420
to places where the regulatory domain
had changed and they were actually

695
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,460
potentially using those access points on
channels that were against the law in

696
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,539
those countries

697
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:15,759
so that became kind kinda interesting
great so yeah I guess who moved and

698
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:17,460
guess who also knows about that

699
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,259
ap alright so looking at some other
stuff

700
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:25,039
and looking at the airport a of course a
kismet

701
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,039
also records all the WiFi security

702
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:32,650
an well yes folks are still using

703
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:37,349
where hand we get it you know sometimes
you got those devices here Firemint that

704
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:38,849
just can't be upgraded

705
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:42,890
prime example that I like to give his
when folks bought

706
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,319
I and computers built into somebody's
forklifts

707
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,529
insane manufacturing and shipping plants
that forklift ends up on a 30-year

708
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:52,130
amortization schedule

709
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,279
and because the computers five-years-old
you just can't go and buy a new forklift

710
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:59,549
does it start at twenty five years left
on its amortization schedule so you're

711
00:40:59,549 --> 00:41:02,410
stuck with this hunt John to condone do
well

712
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,799
I get it but this whole web thing is
certain: band

713
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:09,469
is a dead horse that we've checked
multiple times I mean this

714
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:14,119
stuff broken so let's get over it
there's still lots of folks that are

715
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,979
using WPA

716
00:41:15,979 --> 00:41:19,969
and more specifically wpa2 with ticket

717
00:41:19,969 --> 00:41:24,269
now ticket was intended to be the
band-aid solution he oh my god this web

718
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:26,440
thing is broken we need to improve this

719
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,890
great here's your band-aid nn5 in a
five-year period we're going to fix this

720
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,640
t keep rc4 problem with this new
solution

721
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,359
to BPA to with the SEC MP so we're gonna
have a five year lifetime on this whole

722
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,369
she kept stuff the problem is is that

723
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:49,329
five year lifetime forward to BPA tea
with TK portable PA to which he kept

724
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:53,789
sensually expired in 2007 we're now
seven years later

725
00:41:53,789 --> 00:41:56,940
and people are still using ticket

726
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,979
how many guys have devices in your
environment you have to answer this but

727
00:41:59,979 --> 00:42:03,390
have devices in your environment better
older than seven years older stoner

728
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,690
wireless networks

729
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:08,549
there could be some love you but largely
by the time

730
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:11,660
2002 rolled around you were likely

731
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,259
buying devices that would support WPA
WPA

732
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:21,400
to specifically with the SEC MP so we're
talking potentially a period of 13 years

733
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,400
yeah i watch and they're going to be
limited cases where that's just not

734
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,589
going to be able to to be the case

735
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:31,430
so yeah they're still folks that are
leveraging t keep in their network

736
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,680
optic it was left in the BPA to to be
backwards compatible

737
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,609
for those devices that wouldn't support
dear anything else

738
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:41,670
so stop using it and there are lots

739
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,869
lots of folks told alright so

740
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:48,749
how we defend against some others type
stuff well there's always the creepy

741
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:50,180
FedEx guy

742
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,920
K on this one apparently does have your
special delivery great year so this is

743
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,299
what are the opportunities when you do
don't limit search

744
00:42:56,299 --> 00:43:00,410
and your search not for defenses but for
creepy delivery guy

745
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:05,499
um yeah I had at FedEx or UPS to that to
get something actually decent

746
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,880
so how do you find when these things end
up in your environment

747
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,339
well you can have all your mail opened
at the mailroom or

748
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,789
I maybe we can have some other testing
such as those that they do a TSA for

749
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:16,729
explosives

750
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:19,869
yeah we probably can't afford any of
that type of stuff in it may be a little

751
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:21,190
bit of overkill

752
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:24,729
on how about doing some other potential
detection as opposed to

753
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:29,239
but opening packages hubbell we start
looking at

754
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:32,460
%um signatures coming from packages from

755
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,979
with active electronics in it maybe they
have that little harm yeah you probably

756
00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:37,469
can't afford to do that either

757
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:43,069
depending on where you are so we're
kinda stuck for some of the defense's

758
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:47,049
top I didn't want to serve day give some
credit to the EFSF

759
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:50,420
Wendy reckless and I initially started
this project I

760
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:55,960
we actually query deff about that the
wood Galletti a project such as this

761
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,650
a and you know there we've seen some
controversy but the FF in that they're

762
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,440
not willing to

763
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,839
to help out but I have in fact have had
a really great

764
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,019
a conversations with folks at the FF and

765
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:11,130
in quite honestly the the kept me out of
jail on probably more than one occasion

766
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,349
by asking them about the project up
beforehand

767
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:17,960
and in the key so this one we did ask
the FF about

768
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,319
what would be some other consequences or
not

769
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:24,819
love shipping one of these devices
cross-country

770
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:28,779
from and they came back after a couple
weeks and said yes

771
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:33,880
this is in fact against federal law in
its not so much against federal law

772
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,819
about doing the wifi sniffing in
capturing location in some of those

773
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:39,779
types of things

774
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:44,140
the law specifically in question is that
for shipping active Electronix

775
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,599
and violating postal rules you'll know
whenever you get

776
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,619
by UPS and it gets shipped to you they
have that

777
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:55,170
interrupt that has to be on plugged up
the batteries in your laptops are never

778
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,829
into the laptops or they're not supposed
to be when they come from manufacture

779
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:02,910
I or or from the distributor because
it's against the law to have those

780
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,579
battery serving a power-up

781
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:08,390
or potential power situation again
largely due to safety

782
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:11,529
so that we don't have that thermal
runaway and have an airplane catch on

783
00:45:11,529 --> 00:45:14,039
fire something up like as well

784
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:17,499
so the EFSF advised us don't ship the
stuff

785
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:21,640
because if you ship the stuff in it
powered on what happens if it catches on

786
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,459
fire in some UPS delivery guys

787
00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:28,130
truck and the poor guy dies well guess
who's liable

788
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,519
well we are and we didn't want that to
happen because I do you enjoy spending

789
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:33,989
time with my family

790
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:37,779
I I do enjoy going outdoors from time to
time

791
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:41,249
I am so yeah I also don't

792
00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:45,009
enjoy spending time in prison because
that doesn't sound like a whole lotta

793
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:46,059
fun

794
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:51,019
make but unfortunately because we can't
do it legally and or ethically and I

795
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,109
don't wanna go to jail and

796
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:56,670
nor do I want to have my company or Mike
friends who work for some company liable

797
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,259
for something like that

798
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:01,749
on it becomes a significant challenge to
test ethically

799
00:46:01,749 --> 00:46:05,839
however for those that are willing to
break a few laws

800
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,029
on this isn't a problem and if they
don't care about

801
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:12,509
breaking any laws then great they can
still

802
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:16,219
goin' ship on these packages with active
electronics and

803
00:46:16,219 --> 00:46:19,039
greater broke a law I'm gonna break the
law by breaking into your computer

804
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:21,979
networks anyway so what's one more right

805
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:25,019
yet still federal prison either way if I
get caught so

806
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:28,190
what's the big deal I so they can still
do it

807
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,650
on the problem is we really don't have
any accurate way to test only have the

808
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:33,329
stuff legally

809
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:37,690
okay so how to stay out of the jail okay
so this is a hoax

810
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:42,229
a and good prison uniform from the
lovely still bears on

811
00:46:42,229 --> 00:46:45,440
where they dress their prisoners and
pink consider four-inch

812
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,209
because its allegedly supposed to be
humiliating K so how to stand in jail

813
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:50,509
miss you don't care

814
00:46:50,509 --> 00:46:54,479
a we're specifically looking at me the
wifi sniffing is committed to the best

815
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,979
of our knowledge in all the court cases
that have happened

816
00:46:56,979 --> 00:47:00,039
as advised by the FF is that the
sniffing is fact

817
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:03,519
legal in also determining the location

818
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:07,559
post-processing is also legal was will
however the shipping

819
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,229
above a active electronics is highly
illegal and potentially has some

820
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,619
possibly safety issues so I am

821
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:18,259
what you do you get permission to
actually ship the stuff from the federal

822
00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:19,539
government

823
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:24,259
yeah good luck with that I or actually
put in the car and go do a simulated

824
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:27,709
warship in go for a drive okay

825
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:31,180
so wrapping up to read about time and

826
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,239
Adrian's issue with the projector was
was good

827
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,609
I'm so scuffles conclusions we don't
really need GPS to do GPS location

828
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:40,339
tracking as long as we can do some

829
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:44,299
awesome post processing after the fact a
the problem

830
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:47,440
and it does save the battery but it
still gives a similar challenges that we

831
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,959
have to deal with after the fact

832
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:52,799
they and the other problem is that doing
some others auditing from a

833
00:47:52,799 --> 00:47:57,150
unethical perspective is highly illegal
and potentially causes some life safety

834
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,069
issues

835
00:47:58,069 --> 00:48:01,999
up for those folks that are are
transporting thats however doing some

836
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:03,880
simulations driving and stuff around his

837
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,499
is perfectly OK K so thank you guys for
coming I hope you guys enjoy the rest of

838
00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:09,809
your Derby Conn

839
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:13,269
if you want to get a hold of me or take
a look at the slides afterwards

840
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:16,749
go look at the video recording I will
have the stuff up as well

841
00:48:16,749 --> 00:48:20,319
and the the Python tools for doing sort
of the location

842
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,749
determination after location and doing
some other look up to the brute force

843
00:48:23,749 --> 00:48:26,900
are and get help I had to have their
com-

844
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,950
Fort slash hacksaw the matrix for slash
Lok dash no GPS

845
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,089
and we're still actively developing some
those tools we got a couple those other

846
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:35,309
features that I mention

847
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:38,950
on that are have not been added to the
tools or

848
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,209
have been added to the tools but just
haven't been pushed to the repo yet

849
00:48:42,209 --> 00:48:45,390
I'm largely because one of my coworkers
did that he's in Amsterdam teaching a

850
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,589
class the moment so

851
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:50,630
a big thanks for mister Tom whatever
cutaway for for doing that

852
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,380
day so also we tend to the unicorns a
couple times

853
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,700
I am and so yeah he made a flying
unicorn your argument is our

854
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,109
a is invalid that is in fact not the
unicorn

855
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:06,630
so you fail on that one that is in fact
either in our corner a pic a corner in a

856
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,109
pic depending on which

857
00:49:08,109 --> 00:49:11,319
I fantasy world that you want to live in
yeah

858
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:15,609
it's kinda sad that I know that I ever
almost seven year old daughter

859
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:19,910
and she knows at because of course her
favorite show

860
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:24,489
My Little Pony yes I think I'm I like a
closet Broni and don't know it

861
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:28,349
so the probably shouldn't admit that

862
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:35,349
alright so thank you all for coming
pleased to enjoy a respirator behind

863
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,780
the next the neck
