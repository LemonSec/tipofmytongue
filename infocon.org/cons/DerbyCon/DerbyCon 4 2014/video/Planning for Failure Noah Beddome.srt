1
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:16,720
rebels were inserted

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,779
these compete with eggs require

3
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:24,720
ratso this skinny planning for failure

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,449
minded nobel I'm a former United States
Marine and

5
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:31,810
row rap and a senior consultant

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,760
are you're only taking pen team tag well
thats ratso the stock

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,010
I'm so whenever it I was all sincerity
somebody s Ocean Jerry knows the last

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,010
what to do when it doesn't work I'm

9
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,270
my wife told me I should do talk on it
so the stop exists I'm

10
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,530
so the main thing is graceful recovery
right

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,890
that's coming back when something goes
wrong being able to recover well

12
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,030
and turn that into a benefit rather than
a detriment touch with us talks about

13
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,470
so good talker when is the fight
metaphor uses for basically everything

14
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:09,299
so if you see another talking about is
the same metaphor

15
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,330
I anytime you approach the situation
where someone else is an opposition

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,250
against you

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,590
I say go into it like you're preparing
for a fight right maybe because a marine

18
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,780
I see everything is a fight

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,330
but you'll see that as we go through the
duck writes this quote applies basically

20
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,229
the whole side

21
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:27,610
so everybody is a plan to get punched in
the face by the reverend

22
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,880
her arm there's storage space in a row
he's awesome boxer

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,380
there mike tyson messier it's at

24
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,630
like the democrats here over your topics
are it's really over

25
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,240
methodology rather I read it that's
kinda tax

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,340
secondaries in questions ratso

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,700
so methodology right this is just how I
do you

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,490
red team so changing tax and that's what
this talk has been mostly apply to you

29
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,180
so I'm attorney conduct quality
reconnaissance n

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,630
was urs gathering I try to make sure
that I use

31
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm that information to create a good
quality tax in error

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,729
and to identify points a failure in my
potential tax area right

33
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,720
you can usually plan ahead on where the
key things that could screw you are

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,319
going to being

35
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,590
and knowing that information had times
gonna help you do well so they were

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,940
going to create probing attacks

37
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,860
tie-ins lead in san paulo on tax as well
as unrelated second there is no cover

38
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,160
those we go to the doc

39
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,400
there and execute the scenario which is
obviously the funnest part

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,200
so here that attack scenario prep
getting swole right

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,010
so every fight starts in the gym every
fight starts and all the fights you've

42
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,420
had before in every experience you've
had up to that moment

43
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,690
so it's that preparation the Julian
decide how well you do you

44
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,280
so reparations gonna fall the
reconnaissance we talk about

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,840
creating call the scenario identify
point to failure

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,390
so this is the big thing right points
for include the questions people gonna

47
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,640
ask you during your

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,830
if it's Oceaneering engagement we think
you're going to run into during a

49
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,510
network application layer attack

50
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,599
and how these things are going to stop
you if you identify those ahead a time

51
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,430
what questions are gonna ask with him
making trolls are gonna be in place

52
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,110
the tape to the events are going to
screw up you can and make additional

53
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,080
planning

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,430
that compensates for those issues and
that plan your weekend accord the top

55
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,180
that's how we

56
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,599
gracefully recover right we plan for the
things that we can percy

57
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,340
we have more brain resources to use for
the things that we can't foresee

58
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,670
so we're in a more comfortable position
we had something we were prepared from

59
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,530
the first place

60
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,430
so a tool I use for prepping as I call
the tax treatment see my little tree

61
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,330
with a hatchet

62
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,810
right so Dexter is just a cloture all it
is says

63
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,319
this message area this make her step
hear the things that could happen if

64
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,200
those things happen

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,379
here's what my plan attackers planning
ahead a time

66
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:54,629
I minimize the the stress in the issues
when it actually happens on the road

67
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:59,120
so the more the stories the proper
planning prevents

68
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,810
or performance but I like to be a marine
say prevents piss poor performance

69
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,480
I'm because I guess expletives make
everything more interesting

70
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,439
so we plan ahead we can do better
execution as we go

71
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,840
let's get into how we actually do that
I'm purses as we were planning our

72
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,610
scenario

73
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,160
prison we're going to do is we're going
to create would leading tax or in five

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,780
min 24

75
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,500
thanks right these banks are small jobs
in attacks

76
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,970
that pro a target's Defense is and
establish what they're prepared for when

77
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,479
they're not prepared for right

78
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,009
to reuse those thanks identified things
like

79
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:36,330
what a baby they're running are using
application whitelisting

80
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,400
the using to protect the mitigating
controls in protections are going to

81
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,250
stop the sooner you re prepared to

82
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,340
watch Musa near the hinges on someone

83
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,419
navigating to a website and green
credentials

84
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,699
then and they have application
black-and-white listing in place

85
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,820
they're never gonna get to the website
so you're sinners in the water now

86
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,910
find that ahead a time with these
programs that you can adapt

87
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,110
modify tertiary for actual actual
execution

88
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,860
same with networking application layer
tax doing little small scanning and

89
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,639
probing

90
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,550
mature really identify what targets and
what have a boner these are going to be

91
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,479
exploiting

92
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,800
and also are things going to stop what
you think you're going to be doing

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,860
so tie and a phone attacks these are the
combos right

94
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,380
not it's always a delicious treat I'm
sometimes it's a one-two punch to

95
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,940
actually get to that success you really
want

96
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,560
so this is important because we do an
attack usually a lot of people just do

97
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,580
one scenario if it doesn't work they
collect the percentage ratings and then

98
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,520
move on

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,039
when I like to do in all other cases as
I like to create

100
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,250
hiding in combo attacks right so it said
your social engineering is what we're

101
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,169
doing

102
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:45,160
email phishing mess in an email phishing
attack and the kids a certain medical

103
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,490
dental

104
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,020
well I want more potentials cuz you know
credentials and payload you never have

105
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,900
enough right

106
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,780
summer create another attack this as
well we just finished conducting a

107
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,940
social engineering

108
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,819
assessment of you guys so loving this
policy unit use results

109
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:02,139
and I get the other sixty percent right
or I am

110
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:04,650
when you go through and you an email
phishing attack you can actually do a

111
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,600
pre texting

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,900
attack afterwards this is what we're
doing in turn a response to the

113
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,710
to the social engineering email to and
then like to build another level over

114
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,699
poor

115
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,789
and a little trust they'll help you do
you some crazy stuff when you doing so

116
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,949
Xinjiang's are you reading assessments

117
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,130
so is important understand that one
attack is in the only way to do it

118
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,000
made you create multiple layers attacks
you hedge your bets in case one thing as

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,620
a word

120
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,940
you also increase your level of success

121
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,490
some related sectors right the sucker
punch so this is kind of like the time

122
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,979
attacks and combos

123
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:42,419
except with this does for use this is a
completely unrelated

124
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:46,319
second I layer attack so this could be
something like a network attack what you

125
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,030
doing social engineering tactics

126
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,710
this could be free texting while you're
doing email phishing

127
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,479
this could be i doing physical while you
have a partner doing network layer stop

128
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,880
usually what are the advantages of
secondary taxes to distract

129
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,889
their number resources they have to
respond issues

130
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,060
the focus on one attack we're executing
the other attack

131
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,819
right sir either tech to be successful
one draws the attention of the other one

132
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,069
has a greater success

133
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:15,460
greater success rate I'm wanted example
is

134
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,220
so in runs a really loud noisy pretext
or

135
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,889
network layer an application-layer tak
while you're cohort is walking through

136
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,169
the front door

137
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,050
right most likely is everyone's me a
scramble responding to this

138
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,870
trying to shut down firewall China I'm
without logging trail you it's a

139
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,750
response

140
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,830
meanwhile everything's going crazy and
all the resources are getting somewhere

141
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,460
else

142
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,539
your son who walked in pulled in a Linux
box a little HomePlug

143
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,280
left-right so that's what it's all about
unrelated secondaires

144
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,560
on so the point is stop the real big
thing is that

145
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,379
is really not about how awesome your
scenario is or how

146
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,280
um crazy no day here who exploit you
have

147
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,590
it's about how well your tax strategy
can stand up to the medications

148
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,410
and the defense's a I'm your adversary
which in many times has your client or

149
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,520
your target

150
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,900
so everything that being said when we do
our preparation we should really be

151
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,139
focusing on

152
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,349
term not only provide better success
rates but really a higher quality over

153
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:16,550
to our client

154
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,120
and to the people that were interacting
with is by creating

155
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,199
well fleshed-out real-world well-planned

156
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,340
responsive and gracefully recovering
scenarios

157
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,669
the lowest not only test one Linda group
controls

158
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,080
and get a potential medium to small red
success but also to test a wide range

159
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,039
controls

160
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,269
and how they're able to you I'm to
spread low their resources

161
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,269
the different roles a replaceable
network application and social

162
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:45,100
engineering

163
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,060
and how those controls all work together
to create a cohesive level defense

164
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,269
rather than a piece a defense that can
be divided and conquered using these

165
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,830
preparation techniques

166
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,470
so I'm de pizza and cover the main
points I want to go back

167
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,170
and discover a couple things and so when
a little fast I really want to talk

168
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,080
about

169
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,630
lead in attacks especially in
preparation so we didn't actually think

170
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,910
are the most

171
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,209
I integral and most important impact for
par

172
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,399
social engineering and also a red
teaming right

173
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,820
cuz doing a reading agents funding
source and juice fun

174
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,940
but you don't know where you're going
into ahead of time you can really put

175
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,800
yourself in a good position one for low
success rates

176
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,519
and to the quality the thing you're
providing the the upper you relating to

177
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,470
your client

178
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,490
it's greatly reduced because we going to
an issue situation blind

179
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,839
thank you any fight you're most likely
gonna lose right so I like to spend a

180
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,779
good amount of time

181
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,990
really any rating with the key points a
defense or

182
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,080
in related to the key points of failure
identified

183
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,269
so we're going through Greenville no the
thing will let you know when you create

184
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:50,839
a share what's in it feature

185
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,610
are they going to ask if you're a
protest calling for example are they

186
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,459
gonna ask

187
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:58,690
what your name is sure our right the
essay I don't see you in AD

188
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,089
or if they see you in eighty they're
gonna ask you some defining questions

189
00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:06,149
about who you are in eighteen so you
need to have done your preparation

190
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:09,190
you know the answers to those questions
you need to have reasons why you don't

191
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,560
have those answers

192
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,850
identifying that had a time in seven to
make them a flying

193
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,370
will have the preset and for a lot of us
I and a lot of people here information

194
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,019
security industry they we like having a
plan

195
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,570
we like things being to be able to fit
into a script like things to be able to

196
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,480
fit into

197
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,550
came a predefined box that works in
unexpected ways

198
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,690
and we where that's not always possible
with interacting with people

199
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,329
it is more possible we spend spend
additional time during preparation and

200
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:37,100
planning

201
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,510
and won the best way to do that is
leading the charge so example would be I

202
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,630
call you an insider trading in any real
information from your

203
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,070
I just wanna chat you up and have a
conversation and during the natural

204
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,450
course of the conversation

205
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,209
hope will be able to discover hourly the
conversation directions well we'll find

206
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:52,940
out

207
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,399
can you get too specific web sites your
whitelisting in place

208
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,029
will Kennedy v operating system may be
potential to patch levels you have in

209
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:00,709
place

210
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,190
but let me see if is my best approach
gather credentials

211
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,990
or should really be targeting you with
specific paler exploit

212
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,920
and then we high that enjoy different
scenarios we can create balls what

213
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,200
scenarios

214
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,310
and multiple attack approaches really
help us great

215
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,529
recapitalize on those things that we
identified

216
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:23,339
so we create your share a great but
before you finalize that make sure you

217
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,910
go through and get permission from a
client and do the things

218
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,300
do your due diligence either through our
sin ti or through

219
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,930
I'm probing attacks in just some basic

220
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,230
superficial interactions with clients
even if they just means

221
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:40,040
driving by the parking lot stopping and
smoking in the miss working area

222
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,370
and chatting up a couple people without
actually trying to enter the building

223
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,480
you overdoing a physical that's a good
way I don't smoke but I have some

224
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,930
college doing when I

225
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,639
do a two-team approach have wanna go
smoke sometimes just check out with

226
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,200
people

227
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,389
touch base you use a Gather love
information is from interacting with

228
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:56,070
people

229
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,550
that creates just a greater overall
chance at success

230
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,920
which we all want to get shells right so

231
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,300
out having said that I got was a little
quick but

232
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,450
I hear any questions or concerns they
want to ask

233
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:15,560
sir I'll workers

234
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,110
me my people trying to catch me in the
act

235
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,730
so I can I'm there's a story that's not
missile in mind that stands out to me

236
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,800
I'm that I was to be my really going to
a physical

237
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,529
so a the one of my supervisors at one
point in my life told me a story that

238
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:36,570
he went in and he gave his scenario

239
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,160
and secure pulled a gun on him appointed
in space so that's not who you are

240
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,440
that's a lot

241
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,700
and he said regulations you the first
one caught me

242
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,000
explaining to do a physical assessment
of these things and the guy said

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,510
okay felt really great that he had cut
that person in the apt

244
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,560
but is going away and about 10 minutes
later he was escorting that individual

245
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,240
into the server room without validation

246
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,889
because he felt so good about having
done the only one who did the right

247
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:01,889
thing right

248
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:05,529
and that's going to tell you I try to
keep in mind now I'm symbols got a huge

249
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:09,339
you should probably just say okay it's
done walk away right but

250
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:12,529
um in most situations when someone calls
me on something

251
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,540
the first thing I do try to cede a a
kernel of doubt

252
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,490
right I know that this is a ending its
and I'm

253
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,779
think it in Inception that the seed of
doubt right

254
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:26,010
so this is just that one little thing to
get them to maybe question

255
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,019
things they're thinking right so they'll
say well

256
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:32,060
so one instance I did a I'm financial
institution

257
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,920
at my last job I walked in and said I'm
this guy from this department

258
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,440
and she said well I call the department
that's not who you are and I said

259
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,709
0 well I really a report audit

260
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:46,470
not to a key issues oh that's what the
issue is

261
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,510
went down we sat down she tried to get a
hold of everyone but I showed up

262
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,649
early enough a democrat they knew their
office hours

263
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:55,839
should've early enough for the corporate
office wasn't in yet so she tried to

264
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,260
call everyone in corporate office and no
one answered the phone or

265
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,709
I said well if it makes you feel more
comfortable you can just escort me to

266
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:03,779
all the locations I need to be n

267
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,790
and then escribi on that way you're
covered and uncovered I get to do my job

268
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,230
and we're all happy

269
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,959
so great so after the first few 45
locations I got hurt

270
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:16,070
take me to withdraw BS locations how to
take me to the our site downstairs

271
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,750
we going to Dr say at this point you
trust me talk better kids

272
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,060
we had some conversations she said in
the front door and I want to the far

273
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,540
back and play device into the server
rack

274
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,529
so that being said there's if someone
says why cut you

275
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,470
there's always that chance recover and
how you plan for that recovery

276
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,829
is thinking what is the best way they're
going to validate my nanny when they

277
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:38,579
catch me

278
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,670
how can I really circumvent that and
undermine their trust their

279
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,709
once you can get them to a point where
they're willing to lease was knowingly

280
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:50,139
you what you're saying you can answer
injecting new levels a scenario and new

281
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,339
I'll types of attacks that question

282
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,949
yeah your questions sir

283
00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:02,540
I'll in

284
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,800
so that question is kinda I'm

285
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,940
I don't have a set amount of time so I
do my reconnaissance for the first may

286
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,350
be there to help time

287
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,389
I'll I'll the question was

288
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,670
how long I spent a reconnaissance so

289
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,389
it varies by client vares by target
varies by the situation anti-business

290
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:22,550
are you targeting

291
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,959
some industries and organizations have
more information expose some have less

292
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,899
a but in the end it really its you need
to identify

293
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,120
for things I defy the information that
you absolutely need

294
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,190
and you need to spend the due diligence
to get the information that gets that

295
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,930
for you

296
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,120
or the information that will allow you
to get that

297
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,480
through other avenues so if you think
you can only get that information by

298
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,759
talking to someone

299
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,690
you need to identify what type of
information that you're going to need to

300
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,610
validate who you are to get them to talk
to you about Thursday

301
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,290
pro them I know it's not a very finite
answer but

302
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,370
hopefully that a question user

303
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,800
year sure your or

304
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,110
on I report released on
