that's where I'm from I've been in
ninety cents about the fifth grade

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,160
going back and when I say it. I was part
up the

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,960
school that got one computer that
everybody shared

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,540
for about three or four years or we
actually got some PCs in there so

15
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,060
we actually I'll I'll came to this

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,280
from the beginning or at least I did
I've held jobs and a lot of different

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,890
things

18
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,140
I in the IT world I i used to be working
for the

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,700
Gallup Organization in Lincoln Nebraska
and I get everything from coding to

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,970
programming she knew

21
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,250
project management deserve a writing I
went over to the management side work

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,840
for a computer learning center

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,759
general menu manager job there as a
marks a certified trainer for them

24
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,649
and i won over into teaching so I've
done that lately

25
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:46,140
I the teaching in the social media like
the last fifteen years

26
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,729
cell that's what I've been doing and
that's at China where

27
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:53,420
I kinda came into I want to speak about
today

28
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,810
their speak to us here I run Werner was
the other

29
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,140
one that was supposed to be here but he
had some family commitments I E

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,299
on out last minute so he said you can do
and I said thank you very much

31
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:10,739
so anyway i we had I and idea that we
needed to talk about and he at

32
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,020
what wanted you up presents I the re

33
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,330
the reason why we should he's hacking to
high school students

34
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,810
and I up talked him on ice and you know
really

35
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,959
it's not just hacking that we need to
teach them there's a big disconnect on

36
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,220
what high school students are learning
and what they should be learning

37
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,629
and I got this because I'm the director
of our bachelors in science and

38
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,769
information technology at the University

39
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,209
and I basically built at for
certification so people can get

40
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,280
certification use them for their degree
programs and I'm not trying to sell Bell

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,830
University on anything

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,269
you know I don't care where you go to
school most you are done Sol I'm not

43
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:48,050
doing that

44
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,209
talk about that but that's kinda where
my background when

45
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,760
now since we're talking about schools

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,099
I thought that they would have to use
some type of sample district

47
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,340
to just give you an idea kinda where
where they are where they are set up so

48
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,599
I'm using the Miller public schools in
Omaha

49
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,810
my ass on my older son who's ninety now
he's a sophomore college by Anderson's

50
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,730
15 he's going there's a sophomore in
high school so he's

51
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,280
part of that school system we have 25
elementary school 6 middle schools

52
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,239
and four high schools one of them is a
kinda trouble high school where

53
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,180
people if they don't you know up make it
in the regular 3d go to the over to the

54
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,080
other schools

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,959
I'm in now in that high school system we
have 14 honors courses

56
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,760
16 International Baccalaureate Diploma
courses 23 advanced placement courses

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,799
but no advance courses in ninety at all

58
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,330
and its it's kinda funny because my son
who was

59
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,290
good now as a sophomore in college I i
kinda wondered why

60
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,950
he and take something like that because
I knew I can help them with their

61
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,140
leasing get through

62
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,379
high school with that means that there's
nothing offered so you have to take

63
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,790
AP Stat sorry P math some type

64
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,890
cell that's kinda where that district
yes

65
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,019
opt for a student to earn enough credits
to graduate

66
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:12,110
they need to earn 30 credits and out
those they come into your 40 credits

67
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,150
being lazy and

68
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,000
each credit is a $5 credit blocks 01
english classes five credits

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,910
and if you look at all these when you
look closely at the technology

70
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,800
there are only required to take five
credits which is one class

71
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,949
up technology to graduate from high
school

72
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,520
now that's not representative every
district in faxed

73
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,410
I'm sure somebody could raise your hand
and say my district doesn't do that

74
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,889
but a good share of them deal and a lot
of times

75
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:42,949
they'll say technology slash business

76
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,630
meaning that they can take a typing
class and call that their technology

77
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,669
class

78
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,490
and they have enough credits to graduate

79
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,080
now the problems that we have there's a
there's about five problems and

80
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,509
probably most to these you kind of know
the public understands the most jobs out

81
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:01,800
of high school especially if they want a
career

82
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,289
has some part of ninety and and because
thats

83
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:10,229
I'll read think that that's going train
but it's not

84
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:13,949
technology because it changes so fast
parents

85
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:18,389
at this point at least they hand out
their kids about sex trade and say here

86
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,050
teach them the rest to what they need
for life

87
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,389
I've Tom up till here but when you hit
middle school

88
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,530
we expected the teachers do that and I
do too

89
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,150
I mean I'm I'm as bad as anybody else I
think you know

90
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,470
I don't need to teach English to my son
anymore I don't need to do this

91
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,669
they can do that but promise technology
years

92
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:41,360
right into that group I'm home schools

93
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,860
are good they have the same stringent
standards for graduation the problem is

94
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,039
I in two cases are at least two

95
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,550
two areas one oven then is that teachers
don't have to be certified since they're

96
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,050
not paid teachers

97
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,000
they don't have to be certified in
anything they can just say I want to be

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,509
a homeschool teacher

99
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,069
and thats you know I'm not saying the
home school teachers bad it's not

100
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:07,289
there's a lot of great ones out there
were just a saw

101
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,430
a a presentation with a Rachel two
presentations ago where

102
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,120
her dad was appearing he homeschooler
he's an IT person so she's learning the

103
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,870
IT step at home but

104
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,580
that's one student all the rest of them
maybe don't have that same possibilities

105
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,000
so that could be a problem the other
thing with homeschooling is

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,930
the fact that because they can change or
remove their own curriculum

107
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,580
they can do that kinda variable
curriculum

108
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,800
to where they can say well business
classes and technology will try to move

109
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,729
them together

110
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,580
or will kinda teach him how to use Word
and Excel and that's good not

111
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,039
and maybe that is good enough but

112
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,430
on the college side things where i'm
standing it it doesn't seem to be that

113
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,699
way

114
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,860
second problem high school to try and
answer the call for more IT workers by

115
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,190
adding technology courses they're trying
to do the right thing

116
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,280
but the problem is there's only so many
hours in a day

117
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,940
and classrooms because out the

118
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,500
number of classes there the offer the
variety of classes

119
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,690
it doesn't always give them the
opportunity to add

120
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,669
those classes in their I the no Kid left
behind

121
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:19,370
is still out there even though it's not
really knew it was new when they call

122
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,470
that no get left behind it was just a
rehash urban

123
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,750
earlier educational program back from
the late seventies

124
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,770
but because that one they there's a
potential

125
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,599
to dumb down our classes are least put
it down to the lowest denominator

126
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,110
so everybody gets the same information
and the problem is the students that can

127
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,580
take more information

128
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,289
are getting it because they don't have
to.

129
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:47,009
number three if they work they work with
a if we build it they will come.

130
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,840
mentality and said like the field of
dreams

131
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,199
that they have there but schools a lot
of times will say okay

132
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,860
we more technology classes so they put
five more technology class is out there

133
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,810
but they're not always the ones that the
kids flock to you

134
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,550
because they they put out applications

135
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,470
and then they put out Java and the grout
programming I'm another tack

136
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,889
and they put out web design so guess was
once the kids are gonna text

137
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,319
web design applications the easiest ones
for their GPA

138
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,990
I'm sometimes they have an idea what
they think is

139
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,259
a sexy name and it usually isn't because

140
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:30,060
the person that's deciding what it
should be called

141
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,130
it isn't in the mainstream were kids are

142
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,669
that's all they don't really know what
the buzz words are that will get

143
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,260
kids involved you know just adding
robotics are adding

144
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,130
something into a programming class also
makes this class

145
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,839
you know just blow up with a number
since I wanna play so

146
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,399
I is something that you can know you can
do I'm

147
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,690
and then there's a course to the minimum
requirements will talk more about that

148
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,060
as we get to it

149
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,740
I'm number four high schools are
concerned with getting students ready

150
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,040
for college

151
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,390
I did at a look at a study and this is
what educators staying

152
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,660
that's out these were there 10 top
things that they thought kids should

153
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,589
have

154
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,410
reading writing arithmetic basically I
ride in communicating effectively

155
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,510
questioning being resourceful
accountable

156
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,440
knowing how to learn think incredibly
and being happy

157
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,570
natos a battle those are all great I
want one

158
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,690
all my both my kids to do that but the
problem is

159
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,380
when you when you put that out there it
doesn't leave room for

160
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,890
for technology and the problem is

161
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,300
most jobs cover technology in summer and
somewhere for

162
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,510
and they're not getting that I local
plan to put that down there

163
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,860
he has a I YouTube ah but Ted talkie
gates

164
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,200
locate about this hike in this TED talk
for a lot at sixty minutes I think it

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,990
was about

166
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,690
hacking happiness are hacking schools
like all that

167
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,820
but basically it was how do you make

168
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,390
yourself me happy now I'm not saying
that such bad thing

169
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,459
but its it doesn't always

170
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:13,019
get the end result that we need I'm

171
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,140
now why don't they already have those
life skills while

172
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,329
for small they don't look dull they
don't want deal

173
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:22,829
try and fail so kids a lot of times will

174
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:25,850
gravitate away from things that are hard

175
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,339
I whenever my kids have problems in
school

176
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,990
the first thing while the first two
things they say is the teachers do but

177
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,600
the other thing they say is it's really
hard

178
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,740
and I is a comeback with the teachers
not stupid because I'm a teacher and

179
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,320
you just called me stupid till and the
other part is

180
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,680
it's only hard if you let it be hard if
you don't try

181
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,399
if you try a little bit yeah it's going
to seem hard

182
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,450
but you gotta find the wat you up lot
those

183
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,440
I like a maturity is a problem and it's
not the fact that

184
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,070
every kid has babyish but they don't
always have that critical thinking skill

185
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:09,370
that they need I technology with gaming
and those kind things is helping

186
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,589
but not not to the point where we want
to be a

187
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,920
I live in need to be spoon-fed the
information and directions

188
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,550
if I tell my son a million times how to
do something

189
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,760
and if I didn't tell him every single
thing along the way

190
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,360
he just won't do it now I could say
that's just my son but

191
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,510
he's gonna friends and they have friends
and I've been around all them and

192
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,950
they're all the same

193
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,990
its you know while I'd I didn't know
yours

194
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,230
as both technological down to that line
/url white oh did take it down there

195
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,899
well I denies posted go down to get
laundry basket and dropping it

196
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,170
you know you have to spoon feed him all
the way someone lost at ABC

197
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,820
are always be curious attitude I'll

198
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,560
because that and maybe is the dumbing
down a bar

199
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,690
our whole society for entertainment
maybe that's it

200
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,910
I don't know exactly but it seems like

201
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,769
the curiosity is not there now

202
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:08,149
take that back in second and say if if I
had to tell my son

203
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,870
here's a new game you know the one that
just came out I can remember the

204
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,839
neighborhood

205
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,070
but he added stand in line until
midnight yet

206
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:21,450
but if he had the span three-hour spring
out how did just get in and play it

207
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,760
all heck he do it in a sec but if I said
something else you know

208
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,690
something that one game related it would
be different thing

209
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,190
a lot of them don't know the the line
between what's good and bad

210
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,399
especially in technology will talk about
that were too

211
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,670
and then last when teachers at the high
school level are overworked overpaid

212
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,769
are underpaid sorry my

213
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:48,680
my life elementary school counselor she
would kill me if she heard I said that

214
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,110
there there there underpaid and have
little or no in San and

215
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,360
to work with the students now that's not
that same

216
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,579
across-the-board you could probably say
wall

217
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,649
our computer teacher does this or our
teacher does that

218
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:06,790
and a lot of times that the academic
things done the life skills things

219
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,709
they'll spend a whole bunch vector time
but they don't always do it

220
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,880
in the in the way of technology because
they don't have the current experience

221
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,769
or the current

222
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:20,649
technology that they need I'm any actual
work shoes they're on their own time

223
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,790
and if you ask a teacher if they have
time for something extra guess what they

224
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,260
say

225
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,500
a resounding no we don't have time for
something else

226
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,990
I'll their send sell them a monetary
incentive

227
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,209
yet there is very little and if they
break it down and they will break it

228
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:36,100
down for your

229
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,839
by hours that they put into what they
would get paid for something extra like

230
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,560
that

231
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,810
they all the same I hourly wage is less
than you no minimum wage so what would

232
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,740
you do

233
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,949
and that's our answer back as I don't
blame you

234
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,649
and then I lastly that their most
teachers don't know enough about hacking

235
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:56,720
or technology did teach it on an
educational level

236
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,540
solve the problem is is that they know
what it is they can they can do some

237
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,399
things but

238
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,519
just sitting through a couple the
seminars I'm sent through

239
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,850
you know they're they're talking about
some these terms and I get

240
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,010
I get most of it but I don't get the

241
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,630
down-and-dirty stop teachers in high
schools they they don't have time to

242
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,750
stay up on that stuff

243
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,579
so they they don't wanna look stupid in
for other students just like we wouldn't

244
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:20,889
want to

245
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:25,420
so what's your answer well our sample
High School District

246
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,550
is doing this and and when I looked up
what they did for their computer

247
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,579
framework I found a document that was
dated 2005 that's their latest document

248
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:39,870
so it's almost 10 years old but did zap
basically their framework for computer

249
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,240
science and it's just like a mission
statement

250
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,820
basically if you don't know how to do
something you trade mission statement

251
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,510
cell that's what they did they can pray
they can pleaded this computer framework

252
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,510
and they said okay this is how we want
to teach

253
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,250
computers in our high school and is
great there's nothing wrong with what

254
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,860
they have the problem is

255
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,180
its its just what it is it's a framework

256
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,690
and they have to follow it abt they
tried

257
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,139
to develop academies for specialized
study which i think is also great

258
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:14,019
they have an education entrepreneurship
finance health sciences distributional

259
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:16,639
logistics and culinary skills

260
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,010
soft like it wants to be a cook they can
take classes in high school

261
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,910
toward that and actually be better
suited for those jobs

262
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,880
not won a bronze in technology even the
distribution logistics is about shipping

263
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,709
basically that's all it is. cell very
low technology if any at all

264
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,980
now where we have problems yes

265
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,089
what they did accomplished they did
accomplished by adding some classes in

266
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:44,990
the technology side effects

267
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,970
they have the computer technology
applications which is actually a

268
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,420
business class

269
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,709
they have the introduction to computer
science computer topics

270
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:57,399
Java programming AP Computer Sciences
basically advanced Java

271
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,680
cell they have all these classes but
when I asked

272
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,500
what's the percentage of students that
take those classes

273
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,259
she wanna give me an answer for the
district I said well

274
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,089
is is it something you want to keep
secret she just no no this

275
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,440
it's just you know they take whatever
they need to graduate and I said well

276
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,339
what do they need to graduate

277
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:23,079
that by Pretz so I said would you say a
good share them take the applications

278
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:24,149
class

279
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:29,079
and she said yes and it also ring true
because my younger son who's actually

280
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,110
pretty computer literate

281
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,880
said you know I'm gonna take a computer
class but I have to take computer

282
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,980
applications before I can take anything
out here in New

283
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,180
from grade school aid they went through
that stuff and he's been using

284
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,089
PowerPoint for five years

285
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,360
but he has to take that to go on to
another class

286
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,100
so he's I said again take another ten
cult classic asap Robina

287
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,190
I just need one so that's that's a
problem that we have

288
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,209
thats their hurls that we have a
Corsican their

289
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:00,709
academies don't answer the shortage in
technology knowledge that we need out

290
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:01,519
there

291
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,770
%uh multiple technology courses are not
required so they don't take em

292
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,600
suits are are inclined to take courses
that don't sound fun

293
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,640
they might take a graphics course in art
side

294
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,079
but they do very little computer work
that is more design

295
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,209
or %uh students are worried about their
GPA wedge

296
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,150
now at this point we tell my high school
GPA matters more than anything

297
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,500
for you gotta get into a good college
and get a good scholarship

298
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,960
so that's also problem that we have the
upside class

299
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,510
as and out just call us all technology
professionals

300
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,650
up yes that there's job security

301
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,020
not as many people going to the market
so we got our jobs

302
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,580
salary increase for existing technology
professionals goes up

303
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,750
it goes up educational institutions have
more students

304
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,260
in basic computer classes because
they're not getting in high school

305
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,470
so it's all good stuff the bad thing is
the shortage by two workers that are out

306
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,230
there

307
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:01,039
an essay just sent us an email the other
day said 1000 to 2000 open jobs

308
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,870
this year that they'll need to sell and
that's all

309
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,220
and SDs just the NSA that they said they
need to fill

310
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,950
now talk about a high and job that you
can get for some good money

311
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,910
you can do that but these kids are ready
for that working hours

312
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,120
increase for existing technology
professionals cuz there's not enough

313
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,429
people out there

314
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:23,630
educational institutions have more
students in entry level which we said

315
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,210
was

316
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,090
a good thing now on the front and as
good thing but they're not prepared for

317
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,049
the upper level

318
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:33,020
level classes Weber promised help you
with class with classes because it's

319
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,929
open enrollment

320
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:38,760
so I could take a 400 level class and
never take the 100 level class

321
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,789
a less only season uses know the prereq
not their year

322
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,110
you can take that while 10,000 students

323
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,289
it's hard to catch every bite now

324
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:52,799
there's more downside for the students
college that's a big one especially with

325
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,210
my sophomore in college I know what this
is

326
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,160
ob are averages about 26,000 nations
averages about 29,000 so

327
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,559
at seven in 10 or seventy percent of our
students will have some kinda bill at a

328
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,960
college

329
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,299
and if we'll prepare them on the
technology side

330
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:13,230
they're gonna go into things that they
don't have enough money to pay those

331
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,360
bills of

332
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,429
I was listening to the radio the other
morning in lady got on there she was a

333
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:19,850
physical therapist

334
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,130
she said well I got my bachelor's degree
that wasn't too bad that I got my

335
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,970
master's degree thousand and a hundred
twenty thousand dollars

336
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,669
she went into debt and she was not
picked occupational therapist I think at

337
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,020
that point

338
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,400
and that guy asked her if she was gonna
be a apparel she goes i pay or seven

339
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,750
hundred eighty dollars a month just in
my student loan debt

340
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,770
so we're not preparing the students
where we need to

341
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,630
yahoo had a question why is it important
to study and understand information

342
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,030
technology

343
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,570
this was the highest-rated answer was I
think information technology jobs should

344
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,950
be in the manager's

345
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,419
managers help organize talented people
together basically they're the backbone

346
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,020
to many jobs

347
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,030
technology does not have to be
understood falling now this was the

348
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,679
highest-rated answer

349
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,280
there are over a hundred 80 answers this
was the highest rated one

350
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,850
basically then it was good luck blast
kinda where

351
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,169
where it fell I when I look for that

352
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,620
the skills there soon should have on the
technology side

353
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,730
the one day left in light up there the
self-learning attack and where to go for

354
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,080
help

355
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,360
hardware basics and troubleshooting and
backing up data

356
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,539
those are the kind of things we're not
teaching at the high school level

357
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:29,620
that shit they take those advanced
courses

358
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,309
they're they're not getting those so
what can we do

359
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:36,780
now sometime up college professor I can
say that again

360
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,990
getting in your home and are

361
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,539
our best thing would be if the high
school

362
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:48,049
what checks because then we can turn off
term or in six grade and never have to

363
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:49,140
worry about it

364
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,450
s probably not gonna happen but this is
one thing we can do

365
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,070
we can talk to someone in charge say
keep your Android applications course

366
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,970
but make sure that everybody has to take
it

367
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,539
and it's not a requirement for
graduation except for

368
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:07,880
it's a requirement for being in school
they have to know that

369
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,850
and then multiple foundation courses are
crated and they have to take all of that

370
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,870
now you can decide what you want to do
but things in software hardware

371
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,370
management configuration and maintenance
running client and server operating

372
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,409
systems

373
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:24,929
all that stuff for basic foundation
things that every student should know

374
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:26,570
going into college

375
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,710
now some people might say well that's
just a little heavy

376
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:34,350
heavy-handed while ask the person that
has to go out and get a job as

377
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,270
at their pastor get a job to and they
have to use a big computer system

378
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,530
and they don't know exactly how to do it
because it never had to

379
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,030
then that the on job on-the-job training
was is huge

380
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,370
I just stabbed stopped in at our upper
state resources there Omaha

381
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,520
they do a lot of the credit card billing
and they act guy said well we need we

382
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,020
need to train people in this this this
this I said okay we can

383
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,650
we can probably do that and he says all
know we need to do on the job training

384
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:05,520
as we specialize in this this this I
said how much I'm on-the-job training

385
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,340
needed in the new

386
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,080
we do all a bit well they have somebody
train for months and months before they

387
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,440
get

388
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,740
you know in the building doing things
and we could

389
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,470
potentially help that out multiple
advanced courses then can be created

390
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,400
and then a people want free college
credit or specialization they can do

391
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,750
that

392
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,409
but getting real that's not gonna happen
and

393
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:31,370
I put the Albert Einstein call up there
doing the same thing over and over again

394
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:31,929
is

395
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:36,110
inspecting get a result is the as
apartments and a

396
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,150
well thats that's one thing that out
we're doing over and over

397
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,299
cell with great power comes great
responsibility

398
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:48,220
and that's for the students entrust up
in the real world

399
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,510
weekend we can fix part in this part of
this is mentoring

400
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,429
getting out there and mentoring student
either a one on one or a whole classroom

401
00:22:56,429 --> 00:22:57,250
teachers

402
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,789
would love it but it takes that the IT
professional

403
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:06,490
to call them up and say hey I know this
I can come to your class and explain to

404
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,630
you and they'll say okay which class
debut on Cup

405
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:14,130
and they don't have any problem with
that I'm competitions are big one we're

406
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,510
running cup competitions here at the

407
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,169
at that this app did Derby Conn

408
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:25,350
but there's a lot of them that are out
there students love to do competitions

409
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,070
but you have to help them get their as
teachers will not automatically get

410
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,270
there with four students

411
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,669
at Bellevue East that won their
competition last

412
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:38,390
last year and this year their teaches at
I don't have time to do it so they

413
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,320
they're not doing any competitions so we
have to get in there and help mention

414
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,700
those

415
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,260
students at that point become the
teacher and help their parents and do

416
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,070
that

417
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,860
we can do that by offering case studies
I'll helping them apply for grants

418
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,650
and then there's different competitions
FBLA Future Business Leaders of America

419
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:01,130
have a computer search security
competition the cyber pager competition

420
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,130
I'll give you a more

421
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,890
information about back as a model time
here and up

422
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:10,309
the ATP has a local conference that they
do cybersecurity competition

423
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:14,240
all these are good ones to help them
well

424
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,330
my high school students need your help
cell

425
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,840
if you have the time or want to make the
time

426
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,159
just make a couple phone calls and
helping give your expertise of

427
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,409
is what's gonna help the next step on
our on our system

428
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:32,529
alright up back at the end here I'm
gonna I just had some information about

429
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:33,880
cyber pager at Matt

430
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,960
that thing I want to get you is the
links

431
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,020
had lodged at bellevue that he'd use
last Labour security

432
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,650
we have some documents on I different
things about that

433
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,140
that we also have elaine's to some other
competitions and those kind of things

434
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,419
if you ever need anything or if you want
to add to the blog I

435
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:55,220
just go to that two blocks that baby
daddy do you slash cybersecurity

436
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,140
and out what your information on the
block and I'll hopefully we can match

437
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,970
US local high schools or districts to be
able to do that

438
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,710
any questions yes know quite well

439
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:12,299
one question I who eyes a question down
the hallway

440
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,240
thanks site thank
