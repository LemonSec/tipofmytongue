meant something else in my school and
sup

23
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,889
so anyway I felt kinda bad I got this
talk accepted and then I discovered that

24
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,299
your spots like brand all the shit you
do

25
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:02,639
really hard lead shell-shocked and
things like that so I went looking last

26
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,430
night think it

27
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,500
I should come up with some cool names a
graphic so the first thing I thought of

28
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,989
was

29
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,970
right down that sounds really exciting
and I realized I was

30
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,410
actually Stephen Colbert graphic that I
was letting people might actually

31
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,430
recognized that

32
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,090
are so they know what some threat level
so threat level midnight

33
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,540
there's a graphic I can lift a I was
also at bay

34
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,139
arm giant actually not seen but it's the
duty office keep growing up as a

35
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,310
receiver on the night

36
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,530
one person's the speaks highly to its

37
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,750
cinematic efficacy I guess I go to store
not want to know what I don't like me

38
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,979
fancy graphics any got Steve Carell to
do it a

39
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,139
and I was like a threat vectors like
I'll fucked on france ceded that

40
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,590
on but progress is pretty cool and I
really like to hunt for October so the

41
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,799
new title this talk is dark red october

42
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,299
that was my opening joke

43
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:57,590
I'll rest the talk is all doubt I'll

44
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,590
I'll hi shrew at him

45
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,919
at don't fuck you %uh this is the guy

46
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,859
name shrew right away Aug there's
actually a person named sure without is

47
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:12,160
God given name it was his ex-girlfriend
given name

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,769
up the white so um

49
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,459
we may have a license plate that says
shroom arm

50
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,190
yeah and as Ricardo met cuz hydro bit it
so I told them I would pay for its tags

51
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,770
that he got tags that said Heidi

52
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,120
so smooth now drives the drives a car
just

53
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,580
spiteful license plates that just say
heidi soft this is the kind of person he

54
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,570
is you're currently Tigers petrol

55
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,930
with my wife's name just as a show spite
what I do you owe him a tag be which is

56
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,280
I think

57
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,860
125 American 125 bucks I was 100% come
down by lower

58
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,259
a payment Vic Kohring up bring it on

59
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:58,759
are anyway I start all my talks with the
same basic premise is that you should

60
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,639
not leave anything I'm about to tell you

61
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,190
I am a college dropout II went to school

62
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,139
what occurred for dropping out of school
I went for four years

63
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:14,199
I never declared in a major of which is
a challenge in most universities I went

64
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,810
into the graduation of it he said

65
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,580
I said hey I like a graduate how do I do
that you're like what does that mean why

66
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm literally

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,240
don't know how to graduate like what's
your major by

68
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,699
I don't have much like bats on possible
might look it up in their little

69
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:28,460
computer

70
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,270
issue looks like holy shit I've never
seen anyone so how are you doing here

71
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,449
like four years

72
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,659
who's your advisor I don't have one like
I've just been enrolled in the class is

73
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,529
it going to whatever the hell I felt
like

74
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:44,889
like some sort of like you know Walter S
exploration myself

75
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:48,960
and and failing my toy and eventually
she was like me like 40 credits to

76
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,379
graduate at which point for her I with
this in rowing

77
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,099
what school %uh this is the final
solution University Alaska Fairbanks

78
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:59,090
any other your way up the rhetoric no
are any other

79
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,300

graduate from the University Alaska
Fairbanks that's it

82
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,189
its really amusing I have what

83
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:16,409
whose advisers probably be there just
were no advisers that's what they just

84
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,279
tell kids like

85
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,650

00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,740
this talk is going to be a combination
of inventing your own shit and Microsoft

123
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,330
stock

124
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,279
are all just papers that right now it's
at lost two people right there just left

125
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,770
the relics current I'm out

126
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,050
where sound way too complicated on

127
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,039
we've been doing a lot of right now it
for clients for number two years and

128
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,420
over the last few years as security has
become more and more important to people

129
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,029
of it become more and more interest to
our clients so I'm gonna tell you what

130
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:48,820
we do

131
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,779
murder occurs you take this with a grain
of salt and do with what you like

132
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,740
arm but honestly you know it's been
interesting

133
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,020
I think the last two or three years if
you went to the Board of Directors

134
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,720
have a major multinational corporation
in 2011

135
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,310
and said hey there are external
adversaries

136
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,029
inside your network right now you watch
the owner stop you don't even know that

137
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:12,300
their

138
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,610
you're there what u tin foil hat wearing
mother fuck it out like all security

139
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,430
leave right and temple will be needed to
rate it will be in saying that you're

140
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,680
special breed of different

141
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,690
why fix you get kicked out on premise
that I get out

142
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,420
arm white in 2014

143
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,430
everywhere directors very fortune 100
company knows

144
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,410
their external adversaries insider
network you know once right now and I

145
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,500
really worried about it they don't know
what to do

146
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,649
and three years time we've had a cosmic
shift and how executives

147
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,630
and basically everybody within these
companies you security

148
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,710
so this industry this thing that we
kinda you know

149
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,150
come together where black t-shirts say
goodbye I get drunk at

150
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,300
on you know we thought at skewl we get
paid well it's fun it's important

151
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,680
but suddenly there's a lot of visible
right Mata visibility go to CNN

152
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,260
every day I mean if you're a masochist I
guess you see it and where you get your

153

155
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,960
all manner of security problems in
mainstream media every single day

156
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,340
you know for small their credit card
reaches period

157
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,790
right your car dealers get used to using
online reviews in a retail store

158
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,540
have used it all it's been it's been
taking just accept it

159
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,650
I love these interviews that people will
do like pacer random dude of the street

160
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,970
what do you think at the Home Depot
credit card bridge

161
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,230
arm and it's terrible I'm not to use
credit cards anymore

162
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,840
taxes much really that's the response
like okay whatever you

163
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,070
go get your gold server like I can
appreciate you know what's in the Glen

164
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,510
back whatever you gotta do

165
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,230
are start making right-wing jokes that's
going to give a shot Louisville

166
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,490
on I'm sure concealed carry laws here
really good

167
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,870
on I have a baby disrepair had

168
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,820
on and so things like arm I think what
we used to do

169
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,670
which was securities important and under
skin a white tell you all about it

170
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,360
delightful we should fix these days
because they're bad on the basis that

171
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,000
doesn't fly anymore right we have a lot
of attention and we need a basis on

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,130
which justified

173
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,530
this is more important than that you
know this is why you need to carry out

174
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,610
the smaller delivers why you care about
this possibility or why you need to

175
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,640
spend money here

176
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,690
persons here and one thing I think
threat modeling gives us

177
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,830
is the ability to formally describe
here's all the threats against our

178
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,470
system

179
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,290
in Iraq fashion you're setting controls
ago against it and

180
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,260
the serve as the basis for basically
future work that we're gonna do

181
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,470
arm and so threat modeling which i think
for a lot of people just been kinda like

182
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,880
a

183
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,040
closet fascination what we do it
sometimes for a lot organizations

184
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,540
becoming mainstream like they really
want to do it so

185
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,650
arm you know I'm gonna go through I'm
kinda our process that we

186
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,430
crater last few years and I say we I
mean like

187
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,260
people I work with not sorry my company
just kinda watching our way through this

188
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,480
hopefully if you have questions are you
guys gonna differently I would love to

189
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,160
hear

190
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,680
hear any kind of the backers were going
through itself on the face of it

191
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,110
there's this equation I pulled this
squarely on my ass but it's roughly

192
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,750
mobility type probability time in fact
people risk right there's other ways you

193
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,160
can

194
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,510
you this is you know different different
ways that kinda premise arm

195
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,970
so this is an interesting way to think
about rest well

196
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,660
the singer's you need to know all upon
abilities in your system

197
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,880
to understand all the risk in your
system thank you sir our been Smirnoff

198
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,670
ice is in this some sort of joke like
i'm suppose that

199
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:41,360
right I got ice that's it

200
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,040
I wanna save those for the engine

201
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,810
it is really walruses under no
circumstances a cold Drake

202
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,660
like this is it yet anyway arm

203
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,880
I want to tell a story but you probably
got my talk so are

204
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,170
the challenges you're unlikely to know
all the vulnerabilities in your system

205
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,570
right like you don't have the time to
run around whether your system is

206
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,940
a web app your developing or whether
it's something more exotic you know it's

207
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,500
your entire enterprise whatever

208
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,390
not identify all their own abilities so
what can we do what we can look at front

209
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,090
modeling

210
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,370
on as a way to examine examine potential
actions that result bad outcomes here

211
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,110
systems

212
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,050
right it's effectively a surrogate for
knowing all the mall abilities like I

213
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,080
don't know if there's a bar will be here

214
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,230
but I'm gonna pretend that the reason to
think about what types attacks are

215
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,020
possible

216
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,690
and how they relate to other potential
vulnerabilities in mice my system

217
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,700
what what what do you need something cuz

218
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,190
I'm all for your body whatever you need

219
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,300
no okay are all you're gonna be good

220
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,330
321 all

221
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:51,510
I

222
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,150
arm secondary things you get outta this
is you can rank your threats respect the

223
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,020
likelihood and impact in a structured
passion for you know like these are the

224
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,440
biggest threats facing us

225
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,970
lower priority for us you can also
identify the controls

226
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,180
used to address it solo dry patrol
starts out like

227
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,240
audience p when it's important to
understand if you have a Western like

228
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,080
that he practically

229
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,000
150 controls you know that's what it
takes to defend your enterprise

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,580
you should probably understand why
you're doing something and not doing

231
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,430
otherwise

232
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,860
on so the stock has its roots in right
places on this lot academic papers out

233
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,570
there

234
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,920
this really interesting what's right
molly bassist security requirements

235
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,100
he character allowing all recommended
reading it are a big fan of controls our

236
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,550
security requirements love you departed
organization

237
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,360
so when you capture controls should be
capturing awaits

238
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,170
consistent with the way you capture
software requirements cybercrime is a

239
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,560
test

240
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,880
older traceable verifiable all the space
you anyone go through all your

241
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,600
requirements class

242
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,970
in college that he dropped out over may
have graduated

243
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,310
fancy arm

244
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,620
you know maybe in your hand what what a
good require it looks like

245
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,700
you know it's actually pretty cool you
start to treat security controls as

246
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,690
requirements

247
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,280
it's something that's actually quite
useful especially when you go two years

248
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,940
activity that just because I like

249
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,180
why don't you know in dollars to do
whatever the hell did you try to you

250
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,180
on there's also the Microsoft STL from
modeling tool and process

251
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,380
which I do wanna talk about for a minute

252
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,020
Microsoft to spend an awful lot of time
talking about

253
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,830
threat modeling very publicly reading
books and tools that are out there

254
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,970
are they have you know up processes that
they're very open about

255
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,330
and and very engaging about on for a
long time they had like a busy or plugin

256
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,080
that walk you through the creation

257
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,330
up the threat model now there's like a
stand-alone tool

258
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,230
and that seems to work pretty well the
problem I have with Mike's of Ramon

259
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,310
process reason

260
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,460
giving a spot secured very developer
century

261
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,460
right in like it speaks to developers
there's a game

262
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,720
has anyone played escalation a privilege
game it's a card game

263
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,960
and you can actually like put down cards
and why do the threat modeling thank

264
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,660
and it's actually need i mean it's a
good way to elicit security specific

265
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,180
information for people that are security
professionals

266
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,870
but damn do you get no weeds on that day
and if you have to do a large complex

267
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,680
like not software system

268
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,440
it gets on wielding her you end up with
a good giant listed things and it

269
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,040
becomes

270
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,680
really intractable so arm I don't like
it for that reason

271
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,550
even aid software land I have better
things to pay my developers didn't play

272
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,210
got in car games no pets

273
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,410
I know they put a lot of time into that
try to make it fun but I try to come up

274
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,450
with something here that's a little more
compelling

275
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,880
on and works without getting as deep as
Microsoft one

276
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,070
on if you're at all interested are
encouraged you 1 I'm gonna touch on

277
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,610
today's kinda service all stop compared
to what's available

278
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,900
and Microsoft's website on you know you
can get the pockets

279
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,240
others couple versions of the but there
are other good rituals are used to play

280
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,530
with

281
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,810
actually cut talk about them on in a
minute

282
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,300
so why threat model why did you all show
up here

283
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,950
to %uh warned about probably I can send
one the biggest things you get out

284
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,620
brought my way his contacts okay this
idea that

285
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,470
when I find a bone building a system or
I find some weakness that I care about

286
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,930
but I can say responsibility is this
important in this

287
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,350
grand scheme days and if I don't know
what the grand scheme of

288
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,150
is I just look like a security prima
donna bitching about security stock

289
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,990
right

290
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,089
how many times we had a conversation
what you gotta fix this

291
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:17,939
why well it's important because it's in
secure

292
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,189
starter Brett like a three-year-old you
know it won't fit but good

293
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,329
that's not really justification it
doesn't work with him

294
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,089
are manifest respect the poopy

295
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,270
oh no I

296
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,210
are anyway subcommittee jokes about my
three-year-old again

297
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,480
are well you know thats let's hear it on

298
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,460
so it gives us that ability to have
contest right which is super important I

299
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,080
think

300
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,370
on because I encountered in my life
whole buncha security professionals

301
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,850
who think that their sole job for a
company is to do

302
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,929
the security things and that's what the
company's mandate as I used to work at a

303
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:55,570
big

304
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,630
all say to me registration company

305
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,130
are without getting into name morning
and the security staff that I lead at

306
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,150
times felt like the mission of the
company was the pay the security staff

307
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,320
to be assholes

308
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,549
white they're just gonna sit there and
park and say like me to fix this mess

309
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,690
you can't do this I'm gonna get away
everything what

310
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,700
no no no as a security pressure your job
is to facilitate the business

311
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,170
to operators should assured manner as
possible given

312
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,670
like the actual mission up the business
it's not to stonewall

313
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,500
everything okay right may actually have
guys like well we want our people to VPN

314
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,260
remotely

315
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,309
that's cool you do that but we're gonna
go to their house and we're going to

316
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:33,590
inspect their network to make sure it
secured

317
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,030
what no no you're not 100 other
circumstances

318
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,309
are you going to let go Nessus can
people's phone networks

319
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:45,700
like so many things wrong with the heck

320
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,460
like not released which have all the
shit you find it's a legal that will

321
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,180
have to report like will spend just

322
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,120
all year dealing with the FBI don't
could be pirated software I cannot

323
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,230
govern us was ap-

324
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:00,290
someone locked in the basement books I
found them arm

325
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,360
you know it's things like that so her
body in that context for both the people

326
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,580
that aren't security professionals as
well as security professionals

327
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,309
understand like

328
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:11,710
here's how important this thing is in
the grand scheme of things so

329
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,980
there's a ride a people I think can
benefit from do in front my way

330
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,200
who are developers right pen testing
let's start with back

331
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,800
in the prima donna is on security land
pen tester is ranked as number one

332
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,110
maybe even just be the alpha prima donna
right I am a pen tester how many

333
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,809
protesters in a room

334
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:33,990
you can admit to its cool distorted
parts of I expect some kinda like West

335
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,930
Side Story street fight later on we can

336
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,010
we can go get it on I'll

337
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,910
I've met some Ricketts smart man tasered
I got one guy works really just a doctor

338
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,580
system

339
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,980
we got on site we could use our images
could use any merger rules

340
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,260
and you just destroyed now dodi and
commercial product using like

341
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,100
fiddler and chrome why does a train ride
like well do I have to remain

342
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,150
administration right city I was a girls
gotta the world like

343
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,559
that's awesome but easy there cowboy

344
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,740
ice let's keep this in context on

345
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,190
so I think it's important that when when
pretest you want to understand what a

346
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,030
potential tax records in the system:

347
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,059
what you know we say that pen testing is

348
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:17,420
a way to represent attackers you right

349
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,020
often times where I see is it's a way to
represent reunion of all attackers

350
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,809
you not to an attacker right there
sometimes we go in very specific like

351
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:26,870
I'm in a protected

352
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,800
I am this organization that organization
have this capability that capability

353
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,090
but oftentimes attacker just rolling
around looking for every delegate in

354
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,180
are and sometimes a black-white
organized crime in a way in the door and

355
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,530
then I'll applications they want the
inside right

356
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,730
like a fish dish it out to people and
then I'll get persists you know it's

357
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,600
like well you know there's lots of
different ways

358
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,170
in this or maybe a few scattered acting
like all attacker rather than all of

359
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:49,750
them

360
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,050
it would be more realistic reach out to
people so I can send your urine test

361
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,090
doing a truck model had a time
understanding where we can see might be

362
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,390
an what actors may work against
weaknesses will give you more

363
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,350
credibility we have to tell your story
%ah

364
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,180
back on secondarily had testing and we
all know this

365
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,340
one of the worst part is it's a are very
discreet

366
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,490
tactical view our a small subset of
problems

367
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,620
in an enterprise to demonstrate
sometimes

368
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,260
yeah at Wrigley our ability to get into
a system and its import

369
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,010
right because they are still people
Tuesday may even have internalized very

370
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,790
bad guys internet were trying to get a

371
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,260
but they don't understand actually how
they get in the paint S is a way to

372
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,470
viscerally show them white

373
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,390
I use this little box i plug in the wall
and I scanned everything I owned you

374
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,050
when

375
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,110
II I stole your car arm or whatever cool
thing that you did

376
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:43,380
on it's very hard to place that path
that you took to the

377
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,620
whatever crown jewel your tacky in the
broader context to be able to have a

378
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,400
threat model

379
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,690
you say hey here's the landscape even
walkway

380
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,820
what your face it we took this happy
right

381
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,500
is important because then they see like
you had this little pleasure that you

382
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,600
work through there's probably crack so
over this

383
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,750
that's what we need to go get angry arm

384
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,220
products essence and risk assessments
one thing that we do a lot of our

385
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,300
product a risk assessment

386
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,910
people had to sit back and say can you
break this and then we head back a

387
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,260
little pieces later it said

388
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,500
yes should we destroyed it would you
like to know how

389
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,490
arm it helps us of target the assessment
an

390
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,470
brief assessment out the end in a more
cohesive way when we do product

391
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,940
assessments we look for two primary are
types a

392
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,190
errors there's an implementation I and
architecture

393
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,480
rich just inherent in the system no
matter how good you you build it

394
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,000
if your protocols flawed we own it
anyway and that airs an implementation

395
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,470
right

396
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,920
there's an implementation become very
interesting because on you know

397
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,000
on the face with this is somewhat secure
some dude in 0i the proper whatever next

398
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,790
thing you know a Reiki material %ah to

399
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,860
some system on the problem is
implementation can be huge

400
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,080
and we need to know how to target right
we need to know where the security

401
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,940
sensitive

402
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,480
sections in system are and we're likely
candidates for complex

403
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,520
components are probably been implemented
incorrectly where can we focus so

404
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,970
on you know during upright model helps
us focus on that

405
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,050
are provided like people always ask you
special services like hey what is your

406
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,090
report look like

407
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,320
that's like the frikkin Holy Grail white
Professional Services report writing cuz

408
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,429
nobody likes to do it

409
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,940
and always seems like it's not quite
good enough on so I provided like eight

410
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,190
years

411
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:26,080
sections in our report everywhere
consultants you report writing grants

412
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,350
wine grape January go now the words
happened quite its

413
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,080
a political process %uh right now
modeling for developers

414
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,740
I don't want to be done this too much I
will say developers are not security

415
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,090
experts

416
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,690
of money re what his shot her twice but
not

417
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,090
missus this is amazing on and not only
are they not security developers

418
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,929
offering to our security our experts
oftentimes they don't wanna be security

419
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,800
experts right

420
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,309
they don't give our shit are at the end
of the day

421
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,470
developers are self-absorbed assholes
for trying to get

422
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,890
to delivery as fast as humanly possible
so

423
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:09,460
you could tweet that shit but somebody
else's name on it arm

424
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,520
so so end

425
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,520
the way the reason I say that having
that the other side table from the

426
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,530
developer like throwing the phone Adam

427
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,300
arm des bottes is like the ultimate
manifestation other developers

428
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,559
looking of the rest the enterprise right
like I don't like it. see you know what

429
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,520
I'm gonna do

430
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,690
Papa and shop in all this shit and it
just gonna like you know virtualized the

431
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,920
cloud and

432
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,690
things happen fuck you I T and life

433
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,550
infrastructures card mather Mike Doughty
no

434
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:46,309
arm if you have a live the dev upstream
I encourage you to go do that

435
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:51,230
you so you can see what that meant arm

436
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,260
but honestly like you know any so I i
have been

437
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,700
had this conversation with the number
people who do about security starts

438
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,320
arm about all the potential good they
can happen

439
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,940
any security with that loss play all you
can you know able men all these tests in

440
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,570
your code all the time and they get

441
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,809
integrated in your Russian server and
also the crap you can do all these cool

442
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:11,809
things

443
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:16,640
net netflix has like this really you
know interesting view security and out

444
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,520
of here it's like

445
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,880
al-manar you know basically look at all
these attacks are ongoing costly get as

446
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,350
much of it as I can

447
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,179
what reason I was events and then in
real time I can basically code against

448
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:27,940
these attacks

449
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,600
deploying continuously doll my system
and respond to threats

450
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,090
I'm like that's great if you're fucking
Netflix right

451
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,140
like it's the same thing about microsoft
was Microsoft has a wave running code

452
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,780
that you

453
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,290
if your writers are you can write code
like that most the world can't do that

454
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,960
most the world can't constantly be
looking at all the security in fact that

455
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,600
things are happening their prize

456
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,450
because they don't have that much money
to do it right the developers just don't

457
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,030
give a shit so for everyone

458
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,580
net what's there's 99 people out there
like to

459
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,740
and like they don't care about security
Aug

460
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,130
right molly is at least no way for
developers have something to hang their

461
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,000
hat on

462
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,510
is a I kinda know what I need to worry
about in the securities perspective

463
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,880
developers what pragmatic start and by
pragmatically mean

464
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,070
can you do my job for me like that's the
ultimate developed manifestation we go

465
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,960
in we do security work for developers

466
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,000
really you see me somewhat design
patterns is a real commenting like

467
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,020
security design patterns what well

468
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,100
that's merely specific to what you're
doing I know but you know maybe could

469
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,250
use right all the security

470
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,120
specific functionality and what walk you
have to do everything securely it's not

471
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
like there's security specific
functionality like

472
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,580
well we could you just do that with that
chick job what you got

473
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,390
you're asking me to actually do your job
well you are consulting

474
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,500
place I guess that means I ride in
steerage

475
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,700
on

476
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,780
like we ride for class michael Fisch
that's the way it goes out

477
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,600
are anyway up from only for operators so
this the same kinda

478
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,840
kinda rant like hey you know are talking
about from on way to not actually talk

479
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,380
about what

480
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,730
right Israel last 20 minutes on actually
gonna get off the slider

481
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,730
actually so here's what I can't add

482
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:12,690
a threat right missus largely pulled out
my ass

483
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,350
arm everyone's always asking like when
ID from other what is that

484
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,940
right it's like what is a risk white you
need to construct

485
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,870
English seconds in words that describes
our thing and it's a relatively abstract

486
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,559
concept how do I do that

487
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,860
and so I've at least ride the template
eyes a threat

488
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,600
into it's basically set a variable actor
does action asset resulting outcome

489
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,000
because the motivation

490
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,610
I wanna touch on all those in a minute
we're done threat modeling

491
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,040
you're going to have a list of threats
that by and large it here

492
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,809
so that grammar K I think if you keep
this in your head

493
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:53,299
it'll be useful actually shows up to
about you know again I'm a good song

494
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:57,200
repeat this in your head it's been in a
bottle but slides the starter

495
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,350
you know read and live the dream that is
actor does asset

496
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,590
action because outcome at Crockett I
lost Aug

497
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,770
so the first their star witness actors
there's a relatively small finite subset

498
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,890
of types of malicious

499
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,350
actors in the world in those sets actors

500
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:21,429
there are huge collections of them but
they usually fit into a small set a

501
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:25,549
bucket some PI like by buckets the five
buckets I was that your other people you

502
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:26,160
six

503
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,880
I can't read what the sixth is are you
can disagree all you like

504
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,309
white in general there's people look
like nation states with a set of

505
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:36,240
capabilities as people look like
organized crime in a different set of

506
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,740
capabilities a different setup

507
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,400
motivations each in the post five
pockets have a different set of

508
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,230
capabilities motivation there a largely
similar

509
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:49,260
right start with those in your threat
modeling think about the differences

510
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,260
the nice thing is there's a lot of
public art

511
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,450
out there about all the capabilities
that these people out

512
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:59,419
right so we have activists want to have
Warwick

513
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:03,010
things like that right what we like to
da shit you like to break things that

514
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,460
actually get lower level not

515
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,890
sometimes those people get a rest okay
that's cool on

516
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,049
we have organized crime what's an
example that every

517
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,049
work in Greece that's out there we get
more and more evidence

518
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:17,190
and then nation-state there's an awful
lot of evidence now converted two or

519
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,140
three years ago

520
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,090
what capability exists there you can
abstractly think about this

521
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,140
what do these capabilities these
organizations have then you can get

522
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,410
concrete

523
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:31,190
in your organization are there specific
product is that you care about because a

524
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,490
pass incidents are other things that
have happened

525
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,600
for instance Bob from accounting and
kinda sketchy

526
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,169
way he's constantly serving the file
sharers

527
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:43,380
we're always catching him late at night
in the parking lot I can't seem to get

528
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,690
his ass fired so

529
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,230
bob is a threat actor now call jupiter
is standard you want to call it a

530
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,290
particular nation so I made one up

531
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,309
all our Herman with the guys name

532
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:57,429
president hurricane style

533
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:00,419
you thank you thank you he said and that
was one of the greatest quotes all

534
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,880
presidential runs ever

535
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,290
arm and Fat Tony for the senses people
in the race so

536
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,150
anyway pick your poison find a pro
doctors at work you document them

537
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,290
the nice thing about for doctor less is
it tends to be relatively static

538
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,500
regardless we project our sister doing

539
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,290
if your company makes widgets the same
people that want to steal the widgets

540
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,620
today are probably save you want to
steal the widget next year

541
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,160
right if your company makes widgets and
random people come by or doing drive-by

542
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,150
things and dropping crap on your CMS
systems those same people be doing it

543
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,870
next year

544
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,250
ship actor CMS's arm so

545
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,820
Dr the you can use this list

546
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,640
over and over and over and over which is
really nice now what's interesting is

547
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,809
you have to balance your tractor list
with reality

548
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:48,340
I will give you an example a real-life
example

549
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,830
that I had I was so were small

550
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,179
it's all the company we're small
consulting company for joining a regular

551
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:55,650
partner

552
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,260
on your small consulting company people
ask you to do things the answer is

553
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,860
generally

554
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,400
yes whether or not you know how to do it

555
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,580
or the clyde is likely to pay you'll be
like yeah we can

556
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,880
we could do that like I built lots of
electric cars like that seems legit

557
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,250
0 so we have a small company ICS

558
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,880
national control system company paying
us and today we need to hang on the

559
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,299
security thing we know

560
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,600
there are some concerns and people got
hit and we're

561
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,970
you know some forward on my okay that's
cool companies based in the midwest

562
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,419
up the United States okay which heat
that might

563
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:36,049
I'm having a call was it a should know
what do you do our job is Bridget

564
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:39,549
two and three wire things that plug into
this critical infrastructure bank sell

565
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:41,710
about exploring the air like that's me

566
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,700
what are you worried about all mostly
worried about the NSA coming it's the

567
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,669
only all our stuff

568
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:55,080
I'm I'm sorry what was that and I waited
for the laughter. like you did sad but

569
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,220
there was none

570
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,230
like are you serious delivering the news
we're

571
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,610
were really worried about the NSA
company is doing our stuff like

572
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,850
you're you're in the US right leg I like

573
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,270
and your US citizens in make things that
support US critical national

574
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,100
infrastructure

575
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,990
yeah what do you think yes it's gonna do
with that information school for UF

576
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,880
they were still a defrag be like I don't
know but we're just worried about it why

577
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,380
okay like this

578
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,620
you your throat doctor was need to be
called a little bit there is literally

579
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,400
no secondary tried actor

580
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,750
what the reason they called us was
because the garage life

581
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,530
shit of we did not take them on as a
client

582
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:36,470
um apps not a thing that was going to
happen so

583
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,539
I'll the next thing I actions

584
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:43,539
so these will vary this depends on the
system depends on a cracker

585
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:47,940
will get into the specifics about a very
out that the actions here in a minute

586
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,220
up but in general they were all very
dependent actor and this is where your

587
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,330
creative you'll start to come into play

588
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,750
on as you move forward up assets

589
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,330
so assets can be a dirty word your
organization

590
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,240
like pay what computers do you all

591
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,230
that's a fun question to ask most
companies that I A

592
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,960
you know there's the data center and
ought then

593
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,990
there's a buncha laptops & well that's
the computers we only got snot

594
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:20,049
said technically an answer the questions
work like a geographical where the

595
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,470
things you own exist

596
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,940
we're not actually like a numerical like
we own and number laptops

597
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,230
other companies say really about $500
laptop so we do an inventory like

598
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:34,429
30 2011 top-flight that's in importantly
large difference

599
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:40,260
like how many employees you about all
that's a good question do you

600
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,160
I V to their families think so Aug yacht

601
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,350
so you can go about like do asset
discovery but that's not really what I'm

602
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,299
driving your

603
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:53,419
when I'm really driving at on is a
system representation

604
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:57,200
so understanding what assets are
involved in the system that you're

605
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,360
trying to print model

606
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,630
and even this can be kinda hard problem
because

607
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,059
again developers even light system
network engineers

608
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:09,839
oftentimes build things at the end a bit
there like I don't know what I bills

609
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,780
right it works 30 even my own staff like
we did a little tiny prototyping for

610
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,569
this quiet

611
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:19,470
and the I asked them to keep their heads
a problem like show me the network

612
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:24,129
there were six hosts and four they were
all in 3some that's connected together

613
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,210
like deep all routes morning in every
direction I might want to be a building

614
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,179
like we don't really know

615
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:32,740
like it they work sometimes

616
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,079
like that spell out its deterministic it
was a deterministic well you can

617
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:36,960
certainly don't like

618
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,740
on packets are

619
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,329
she Wow arm

620
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:49,129
so anyway I'm it's important that you
find a way to represent your system

621
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,510
in a consistent fashion I want to show
you some examples and then provide a

622
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,539
recommendation

623
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:56,659
on sis record representation cosmetic
work now I see

624
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,849
first preface this by saying I was
network engineer by trade

625
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:03,230
of her number years actually give a talk
at the site Las Vegas

626
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,539
years ago about what how to build good

627
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:12,130
network diagrams I hey bad network
diagrams I'll stop beating its dead stop

628
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,500
henry factor network diagram before
anything else happens like

629
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,930
don't mix players like if you're drawing
a layer 3 diagram and there's a like a a

630
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,420
photo realistic picture of a switch on
it

631
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,220
I'm going to burn the projector to the
ground like that is not allowed there's

632
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,990
all kinds of things that you should not
do whatever diagram

633
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:32,310
because you're trying to make a reader
understand

634
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:37,440
understand what it is you're doing not
tried to blind them with your idiocy

635
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,050
for example

636
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:50,050
this is somewhat home network

637
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:55,680
what thats you think you're a geek right
whatever geekiness you I i have a

638
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,250
samsung

639
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,650
at Snyder whatever like going out this
guy has you out pic by several orders of

640
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,520
magnitude

641
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,070
on including his home automation al 2000
arm

642
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,849
this I little when I troll the internet
finding like

643
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:13,070
bad network diagrams and that kinda pay
of and this was one of the worst

644
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:20,070
on the flip side I think one of the most
concise art was this one

645
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,200
which works very effectively for you to
understand how you get from your laptop

646
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,040
to your email server right

647
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,510
so I was really down with its like the
colorants

648
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:38,410
consistent the farts consistent like
this is all good

649
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:43,230
so I would encourage you however not to
invent your own sister representation

650
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:43,940
mechanism

651
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:48,000
on in the one thing that i think is
really use wow I we got slide transition

652
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,710
there that was unanticipated like that
Woods

653
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,960
that's when you know you saw slide from
somebody else slide deck because it

654
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,810
transition in right with it for

655
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:03,410
I I didn't hurt this at all that was not
obvious

656
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,840
I'll so anyway microsoft has created is
kinda comin

657
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,170
a I think all the DFT data flow diagram
so

658
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,960
it's actually very useful for on having
a consistent way to capture

659
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,030
I your system when you're trying to do
print model

660
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:23,200
it for a couple reasons 1 they really
really capturing the

661
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,130
kinda base elements that you need to
understand what you're doing threat

662
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:26,619
modeling

663
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:30,490
secondarily you can use their troll to
do this or used SEO

664
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:34,800
or even are god help you if you're on a
Mac you on the gravel or whatever

665
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,030
release use the same consistent set a
very simple no

666
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:43,109
there's no photorealistic servers here
there's no 3d people look at all happy

667
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:47,109
right there's some boxes in some lines
another line another circle right

668
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,970
this is University you need to care
about when you're doing from modeling

669
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,730
I'll example diagrams I want to walk
through mostly cuz I'm

670
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:59,070
already running late on time so on what
you got clear trust fund raising have

671
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,160
data stores your data flows

672
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,250
this is what you need to worry about
when your front mock

673
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,970
Microsoft again has resolved
documentation around this

674
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:12,230
you have these ideas level 0 1283
leveled the FT's

675
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,450
on where basically definition is

676
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,700
levels heroes like their high-level
architecture

677
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,650
level one is more detail level two is
more detailed level 3 is

678
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,780
even more detail that's definition

679
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,130
arts pictured you to find a level detail

680
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,640
which you are comfortable on and which
does not result in this comment or

681
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,300
outflows

682
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,570
shit you're trying to analyze don't
really pay attention to your reminders

683
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,590
of stuff hope it that

684
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,660
levels too much because of this corrupt
up around it

685
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,970
on outcome so these are the bad things
that you would like not to see happen

686
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,810
so somewhere like we're great in your
throat you're gonna have white

687
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:53,859
hey you know crimes committed her ID was
stolen her but she's got

688
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:58,340
over cooked or whatever the hell it was
like some bad things happen as a result

689
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,910
about this thread after obviously that
outcome will be very specific to your

690
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,380
on your system that you're looking at

691
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,840
again Microsoft this are really
diversion what they do arm

692
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,280
they have this thing called strike then
went on from ours tried before

693
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,160
you find it useful yeah lot near

694
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,460
so as security professionals like we
understand that outcome

695
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,400
right like we can talk about violation
confidentiality integrity and

696
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,830
availability or whatever a

697
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:31,369
your choosing I arm was kinda joking
array

698
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,740
on never rights too early in the day for
that one

699
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,720
on she really well as she stepped out
flatly

700
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,369
robbery of not going into work at all
noted will throw that one away

701
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:46,500
made to feel like a stand-up comic is
trying to material like of the cocky

702
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,970
sometimes it works

703
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,330
sometimes make a CIA joke go anywhere
arm anyway so they have this thing

704
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,060
called strides moving to every

705
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,390
repudiation information disclosure
Dawson television a privilege

706
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:02,359
first of all fine repudiation

707
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:08,140
so fun non-repudiation and don't get
confused between the two

708
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,240
right you know what I had a lot of smart
people

709
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,800
night hours on it and they can't keep
repudiation non-repudiation

710
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,330
straightner head i cant what with what's

711
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,820
that's what you sir nothin nothin okay

712
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,140
it I mean honestly I'm not trying to
beat right legal all the things that

713
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,440
turns to throw at people that you're
trying to

714
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,000
make clear threat modeling repudiation
is not return to you

715
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,710
right it was I'm just dead's what what

716
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,940
it has a car like I was that really
strikes me is like well

717
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,930
i havent st. I D E I need in our

718
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,290
watch Justin repudiation I'd call it
good

719
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:50,090
um so what they've done is is very
structured like if you ever

720
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:53,380
external HD they can suffer from
stripping a repudiation it's actually

721
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,099
above about

722
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:57,130
that as lawmakers including one that's a
question mark

723
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,580
reissue may or may not have any view the
data store like mr. just occupation

724
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,570
there's a question mark

725
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,770
like no no no no no like you you'd have
to be like

726
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,820
mare like that that's not something
that's okay

727
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,670
um anyway I feel like this gets really
should try very quickly I encourage you

728
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,160
not to use tried

729
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,150
there again is on a whole lotta evidence
out there documentation if you choose to

730
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,160
go down that route

731
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,310
I think I found Nemo security
professionals you just think

732
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,440
you go I know what about you don't need
a pin them in the pocket except maybe if

733
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,010
you're curious

734
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:32,490
Sega reporting on motivations as a lot
of people about doctor in years

735
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,550
feel like hey I really don't need to
care about the motivation that people

736
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,960
gonna do bad things

737
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,119
you know some universal truth I disagree

738
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,440
motivation change over time threaten
virus change over time

739
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,960
because it that some rights will be up
yeah I like to give joy 10+2 is I wanna

740
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,580
have

741
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,099
ok I thought I was just he was being
really excited about motivation

742
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:58,250
I'll so um you know it it's really
something that you know as an example

743
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,900
arm you know when some hacker group made
up

744
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,369
or chanters the side so I go watch the
world burn

745
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:08,940
are like they're gonna go do stupid shit
and they're gonna like

746
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,859
go do it for like the most bang for the
buck why take down as we're or something

747
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:17,000
you know and so when porch and all
pissed off at the world

748
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,670
I bet threats had having to do with
whites repeating activism

749
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:24,030
are gonna become more 40 when like 4chan
is off

750
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:27,630
because it jewish Liberty units for them
to stop watching all the Ford

751
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:33,339
are my porch and his jokes are brought
or genders in the room Germany get

752
00:42:33,339 --> 00:42:38,220
docs later because it that so I'll

753
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:45,220
nobody what's my dudes I wouldn't be so
sure sir

754
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:50,220
home anyway so at the other day have the

755
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,540
assets actually actors been that bad
things will happen

756
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,380
unitary sec well what what can I just
look through that

757
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,560
like if I know all the actors I have
like a dictionary attractions

758
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,570
and I know my assets up could I just
moved through it all

759
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:07,230
like together sorta massive comet Oriel
explosion

760
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,530
and I posit know you do not want to do
not under any shaper

761
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,420
your circumstance are you end up with
like this idiotic list

762
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,820
really began to well broken down
completely useless

763
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:22,170
this of threats because what a computer
do your job for you

764
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:27,109
mister developer arm you know you how
you end up with things like nation-state

765
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:28,440
does dawson wrote her

766
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,320
Gordon organized crime dawson wrote her
insider dawson wrote activist also

767
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:32,810
router

768
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:36,240
okay next asset Nations AP forms Dawson
web server

769
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,790
organized crime does Dawson web sorry
like what useless

770
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:44,099
right so actually when I get to hear the
second is you can actually

771
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:48,119
the still some of those down to
something simpler so he say what

772
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:51,890
all these different doctors can do a bad
thing to a router it looks like the nile

773
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:52,670
service

774
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,780
their motivations may be somewhat
different but the outcome the same

775
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,310
motivation actor doesn't matter that
much to do in this case so wanna say is

776
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,839
never base now service

777
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:04,210
takes out the router and you can get
your shit call that's a

778
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,740
right right I should probably captured
up 1

779
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,570
as opposed to like five discrete ones
were called up actors individually

780
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,020
because it's not that important

781
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:17,150
this get the 1i cortelli arthritis as
specific as you need it to be

782
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:20,890
if there is a material difference in
because I've one actor versus another

783
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:24,390
or what action versus another one
outcome person another then

784
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,980
they're two different threats if there's
no material difference but altogether

785
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,580
make your life easier

786
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,220
this is something that I think that when
we do this practically have seen people

787
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,530
really struggle with

788
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,839
and when I encourage you to do is go to
Colorado get really baked and you try

789
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,000
modeling because you learn to just

790
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,849
let low rather than getting ready I do
not encourage drug use

791
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:47,650
acceptance that states where it is legal
as Leo with your employer to do so

792
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:52,150
so Aug anyway donor rap from the actual

793
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,339
you know finally is common denominator
and run with it

794
00:44:55,339 --> 00:45:00,030
arm so here's a suggestion got a break
from gotta find some sorta coverage here

795
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,500
so from what you I normally do is

796
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,020
take a DFT right down and then go
through

797
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,690
and look at you know for each element
what cyber attacks repost where the

798
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,660
trust ponders reading important things

799
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,800
right down the price associated with it
no take a breather

800
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,210
come back do the same thing for actors
take it's a big rack

801
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:23,609
it takes a while I mean it separate take
something that's a little bitter proxy

802
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:27,369
used to once you get used to it you can
pretty rapidly drive down trees with

803
00:45:27,369 --> 00:45:32,230
rights on it is really just the exercise
we take your time

804
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,589
thinking about it check check check that
you got this right after that right

805
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:37,310
after that right after that tracker

806
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,510
and working your way through it on later
on I mention hey

807
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,440
then you should validate this someone
else someone else in with your workers

808
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,380
if you like a

809
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,270
I've been dealing with organized crime
lately and their TTP has been vs been

810
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,880
doing the point of sale systems

811
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,089
I don't see that showing up here ok cool
on through that

812
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:56,320
as right so Katrina

813
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,330
rights be pragmatic are you know capture
the controls

814
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,980
kinda running right now jerry cans or
chrome exactly five minutes

815
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,060
arm capture the control the same guy
okay when I say controls me

816
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:12,200
the things that stop the threat right if
there's a denial-of-service

817
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,599
I would like to capture what kinda ways
I can mitigate that Valle service Wed

818
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,950
so the end in the front line when you
look and say oh I need to go

819
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,990
yet you know for in Cloud Player or
whatever

820
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,740
you know again three-peat roles as
requirements don't get overly

821
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,210
prescriptive about it but

822
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,730
there certain times we think very you
know easily get specific troll

823
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,210
on also out you should capture
likelihood and impact that's what allows

824
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,230
you to write it

825
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:37,710
all word on that miss

826
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:41,070
800 30 risk assessments

827
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:45,910
and corresponding thats 119 I so these
are documents I'm sure you all have

828
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,490
memorized

829
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,240
I are anyone ready 130 resort

830
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,380
yeah how your cheeks like good work like
us your special breed a

831
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,820
government worker arm

832
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:04,480
so I think what's really interesting
about a hundred thirty is it provides

833
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,510
on descriptions likelihood and impact

834
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,589
they're relatively tangible and people
can rally around

835
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:15,040
now this list 30 reach high medium low

836
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,220
out some people use port some people use
five you like Google like

837
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,020
risk likely but in fact you'll find like
these major seasonal have white anywhere

838
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,440
between three and five data points each
axis

839
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,130
I like this because honestly I think if
you start debating the difference

840
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,390
between like a while when a very low or
high to very high

841
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,810
you better things to do with your life
like go to Colorado get paid

842
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,900
arm saw all you recall like it's true

843
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:43,070
arm well what's really funny is the
likelihood description

844
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:48,290
sector to makes lot of sense the impact
description like a god damn paragraph

845
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:49,109
right

846
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:52,910
in reality it's really only a few words
are a different light catastrophic and

847
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:53,560
severe

848
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,210
hearses serious Spurs is limited that's
all you need is a cover for some reason

849
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:57,920
this like got

850
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,599
super pedantic like when it was called
it super catastrophic things that could

851
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,230
happen like

852
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:06,430
I understand super catastrophic as a
concept you shouldn't need to then write

853
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,580
a paragraph so

854
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,130
I know dislikes like symmetry and stuff
so I wanna like right that would be like

855
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:15,400
you to expand this one or shrink that
one why do not give me

856
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,470
is to think that they don't fit on one
damn slide

857
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:23,380
like this just looks empty and this
looks ridiculous so as a consultant I

858
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,310
get annoyed

859
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:27,460
up but I felt like I should put this
here for you as I needed some sort

860
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,530
yell about so you get hired right now
wondering

861
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:33,760
when the talk was gonna and so 0

862
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,200
practically what does this look like
when you're done you've identified

863
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,760
your throat doctors your assets you
develop data flow diagrams

864
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,160
you sat around it fought really hard
about the ways they could be attacked

865
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,910
what does it look like you're gonna have
a list of things that look like this

866
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:52,329
Hey look acted as action asset for
outcome because the motivation

867
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,430
right you're going to have a list %uh on

868
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:58,630
in our experience anywhere between maybe
a

869
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:01,869
K all weapons 50 depending on the side
the

870
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:04,910
the system on along with that

871
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:08,130
you're going to capture are likely to
the impact

872
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:12,180
and then again that matrix supplied
Revit readers like these respects a

873
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:16,430
if it's a high wrister high-impact Union
likelihood it should be declared a high

874
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,230
risk or whatever so he say

875
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,240
risk is high cuz impact is high and then

876
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,260
who's realistic controls right hear
things you can do to mitigate

877
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,980
this right I would encourage you to
counter this as a stretchy

878
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,050
not as PowerPoint slide because it is on
god damn

879
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:35,490
you'll be in power point on you can make
yourself and I've done this

880
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:38,869
an Access database

881
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:43,890
Aug I've coded Access databases twice in
the last six months and I felt like I

882
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,859
was back in college

883
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:48,540
I was like for snowball where's the
sequel

884
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,660
like I can't rights equal Kors record as
an Access database and yes you can but

885
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,829
it's like this art thing that has to
happen

886
00:49:54,829 --> 00:49:58,150
not access is only psychoses as it was
last time

887
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,280
at and access last year okay I'm sorry

888
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,480
oh my god it's a lot of heads I think
there's a talk to give your eyesight yes

889
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,720
my three-year-old son is on taxes
program us

890
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,750
that's where we're at with access on

891
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:16,250
so when the models complete you have
anywhere between 1850

892
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:20,300
right up what I would encourage you to
do is take your coworker friends say

893
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,800
a I made this he spent an hour looking
at it tell me what I mister what you

894
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,310
think is

895
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,880
Gregory cracker right you're wrong or
whatever on

896
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,490
collaboration is good because you can
get kinda myopic looking at a specific

897
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,680
set up prices are thinking about a trio

898
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,690
thank you get kinda wrapped around the
axle if you like are you missus and

899
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:37,160
higher

900
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,589
thing on this cross boundary so have
enough extra eyes on super important

901
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:45,380
in summary the process was like this
identify the product

902
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,240
start with that was the five that they
gave you still down more specific one

903
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,150
partner County whatever he

904
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,339
create some sort Asus representation I
would encourage you to use Microsoft

905
00:50:55,339 --> 00:50:59,280
yet the true or similar instruction
iraqis

906
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,800
school just take the five elements they
have been represents

907
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,450
not bashing if you already have good
documentation

908
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:11,310
use it but if you already have good
documentation is like a left-handed you

909
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:14,400
record right this is not something most
organizations out

910
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,500
on and the ones that you but it did you
record your extra rare

911
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,050
is its that's wild ride shitty analogy
you

912
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:25,619
because I have a lot to your cores with
the best search for all right handed so

913
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:28,690
Aug

914
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:33,099
anyway brainstormed restaurant assets
that actors an action or whatever way

915
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:38,770
happens to work for you I'll rains you
remember when people used to take notes

916
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,609
not I got my camera look like that since

917
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:48,119
picture is our protocols here is it not

918
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:52,530
gonna I see speaking of my private
collection

919
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,650
Aug but don't its outright

920
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,710
okay up rainstorm in the controls are

921
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,450
you know it's a tirade sorry threats
that right on review validate

922
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,599
you okay that's the basic process that
we follow

923
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,589
we've had a lotta a yeh Jo is excited is
the municipal

924
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:13,920
yeah and up now what of I honestly
didn't think I'd get through all my

925
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,730
slides

926
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:20,070
so

927
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,440
Scott so um depending on what your

928
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,470
during the prop on going forward you
know go off use it

929
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:29,589
testers like stopping prima donnas
understand that you took one little part

930
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:31,550
the security card

931
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:34,770
arm assessments whatever on

932
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:37,900
also well yeah but said the results
because

933
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,220
whether you're doing this for your own
enterprise where you can read you some

934
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,420
these artifacts later

935
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,790
or your dirty consult like me where you
can reduce our role or text later

936
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:50,530
hopefully remove the right person the
client names

937
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,560
whose up I've never done that

938
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,160
what they don't better data in there
like also I saw your working for GM oil

939
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,170
as I guess I was elected I'll

940
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,250
gems are required example on

941
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:10,040
probably so anyway say there's also a
lot of will be reused later

942
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,890
a word on reuse on review sounds good in
this space pretty can be dangerous

943
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,230
because if you get in the game are
cutting into a senior UN Security stop

944
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,339
you're trying to get a comprehensive
view of things

945
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:23,630
oftentimes you'll screw up cuz you
forget stock usually

946
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:28,970
it is you're cutting and pasting that's
my cutting and pasting voice my

947
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:33,089
um I would

948
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:37,349
on anyway um that's that's all i care
questions about rightly

949
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:40,550
I don't know if you want anything

950
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:47,550
yes there's a question thank God

951
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,510
so so the ranking so um if you you can
grab

952
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:56,230
likely impact on it on a two-dimensional
chart basically

953
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:00,150
are and again this is where like you can
pick a model here that works for you

954
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,550
go to Google and take a look and see
what people think but on

955
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:07,599
you know there's this basic calculus
like it the highest rating for 101 like

956
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,390
it want to meet him once a high

957
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:12,630
you know yeah so you just picked pickard

958
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,109
to mention that you want to read against
editor that you want to build that

959
00:54:16,109 --> 00:54:19,720
equation stick to it and recommend or
you get more complex than that but for

960
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,950
the most part about its not unusual

961
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:29,950
in the back

962
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,930
I said

963
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:41,589
is there a reason

964
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:45,079
okay cuz out to us it's okay you would
like to dispute a charge

965
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:50,680
no no no go over there just because I
need to exert my part so I

966
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:56,089
bush you look like Cartman so we could
just run with it

967
00:54:56,089 --> 00:54:59,820
Aug I its to you guys

968
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:06,820
for a question about my biggest security
and

969
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:10,350
your bro

970
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:17,350
game right

971
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,070
so

972
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,320
how do you overcome that it becomes
extra problematic in like agile and two

973
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,160
where a lot of people are going and this
is where I find you either need to just

974
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:35,730
totally blocked up and pay the money to
embed developers in the front pair

975
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:39,359
that security experts directly into
development teams are not expected

976
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,670
developers B train on it

977
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,869
for all to pay a large security staff to
be outside it basically on it the shit

978
00:55:44,869 --> 00:55:46,140
out of things that are happening

979
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,470
trying to educate developers respect to
security: is

980
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:53,300
euro and not necessarily great use your
time I would encourage you just pay

981
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,060
security people to live next to
developer be over shoulder

982
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:00,010
that's where we've had the most success
I think I gotta go now so it's been real

983
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:00,520
fix my truck
