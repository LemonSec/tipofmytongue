Marshall University

22
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:41,990
I am also a pen tester I have

23
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,990
consulting company do well but

24
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,520
obsessed webb says assessments I can say
words

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,860
and and not penetration testing and I
recently read a book with that vary

26
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,360
Thomas called building in information
security awareness program

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,869
on could vary makes me look very good

28
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:06,070
up I and now I have to prove it ray

29
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,429
okay so II valor Thomas I'm at

30
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,069
principal security consultant at a
company called secure gone

31
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,980
where a base at RBC my awesome boss is
sitting in the middle there in the

32
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,060
bender shirt

33
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,830
rate we're always interested and I bring
your own talent so if you want to be a

34
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,879
pen tester

35
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,560
come see me him for me either one is
fine

36
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,890
so yeah bill and I just read a book
about awareness training

37
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,900
and well I do a lot I love

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,500
often serve work have I still have to be
pretty well-versed in defensive

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,190
because it's not just enough to read
even break into a place in Brega love

40
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,220
their fun toys

41
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,670
have to help them fix that so that's
kind of where the purple team starts to

42
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,280
come into play like it's it's

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,660
red is not enough anymore blue is not
enough anymore so

44
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,940
red and blue together rate may a
curveball

45
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,810
I've kids seria to powers activate

46
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,760
we bet yes we have a practice that we
all have our rings we're a yes

47
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,769
but thats next time next time we'll get
rings

48
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:14,769
I can are about yep

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,629

you know other Albany well me and my
team

56
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:44,200
do all the defense's and infrastructure
on

57
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,700
and then I run a phishing campaign
internally for all of our users it's

58
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:48,950
like

59
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,780
2000 so on and I

60
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,390
they let me use meta spotting everything
in our life

61
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,010
on our live network ish and I I am I'm
gonna miss you

62
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,920
the most I think um yeah

63
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,360
a yes testing and prodded is

64
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,370
is a fun exact thing

65
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,090
year at the a ftw

66
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,479
yeah next in

67
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,130
America while I'm I'm the and practice
manager the attack on Pan

68
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,350
team intact but labs a.m. he might know
me as blacks

69
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,840
am at so yeah so basically

70
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,060
and same as as is these other individual
state it is

71
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,220
a.m. in my for start-up and testing is
all about breaking shit and

72
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,490
as you mature as a penetration tester
you realize we're not graduating classes

73
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,350
were consultant to campaign test

74
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,530
and it's a consultant aspect that makes
the most sense because everything we do

75
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,440
offensively

76
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,570
is to help the defense of the
organization so

77
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,919
and at me and Martin boss a long time
ago I think where

78
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,960
and force the making fun of a customer
but we came up with the T

79
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,889
with the term purple team in that kinda
stock but now it's actually a real thing

80
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,139
I'd like to see it

81
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,220
continue to grow as people mature that
the best defenders years they are also

82
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,180
the best

83
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,229
attackers in the best attackers now had
a

84
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,910
in affectionate so

85
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,220
I cuss a lot so I part as a

86
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,500
hi amber McCann I'm a principal security
consultant for active on labs

87
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,240
I I am also on the penetration testing
side

88
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,199
I like to focus have leon advanced
fishing techniques

89
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,360
I run a blog with this guy next to me

90
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,110
penned SD tech com and I also wrote the
fishing frenzy framework

91
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,690
om and unlike these guys Matt mention
we're all a we all played at work

92
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,240
defense

93
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,250
so on that with the stock all about

94
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,780
my name's rise Davis and I talk with a
loud hmm

95
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,830
our connects team as well principal
consultant I specialize in

96
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,180
your garden-variety network penetration
testing

97
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,389
team social engineering in a fishing net
and that other stuff

98
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:11,490
happen special an I wanted perot talk
objects out that was pretty cool for a

99
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,280
little while

100
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,620
the Russian it

101
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,139
on I like the code in Ruby words and
that's why modulus

102
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,069
just all kinds Obama fun InfoSec stuff

103
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:28,669
%uh ready I think is that right r3d lie

104
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,710
sets up like that yeah

105
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,940
but Diana Kerekes said you know whatever
side you're on Red Team Blue Team

106
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,289
a as a consultant we come into networks
and and and we look at things

107
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,250
offensively we can identify gaps in
security so that we can

108
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,669
improve the overall security posture the
organization where we're on the same

109
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,080
team is

110
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,620
as the good thing we're all trying to
cop the same goal which to just identify

111
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,220
vulnerabilities identify

112
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,610
potential attack vectors and and and
remediate risk

113
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,389
so that's what we're talking about today

114
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:02,400
thing heard

115
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,630
sorry I'll floor so over the top good

116
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,520
yeah of star somewhere

117
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,490
what here you wanna yet

118
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:20,660
I i think headed over

119
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,710
so basically I think the first pain
point is that people don't know how to

120
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,479
defend against social engineering

121
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,039
I mean how many people have a security
awareness program

122
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,960
in their organization how many people
had to invent

123
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,120
themselves I mean people bought it for
way too much money

124
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,180
all yeah that's good well I mean when

125
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,080
westward hotels are here to you too
hackulous today like you did

126
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,560
huge he did die and I last year

127
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,710
a that

128
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,410
you know he sells security awareness
products in actually his company does a

129
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,020
pretty good but there's some pretty bad

130
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,319
ski whereas products but basically what
I would say is that one size does not

131
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,000
fit

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,889
all and that's the reason we were at the
book was just so that you can

133
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:17,800
either I build your own or buy wine

134
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,430
as an informed consumer that with new

135
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,930
for say that the biggest issue we have
is that people don't understand that

136
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,979
they need to do that in order to you

137
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,589
bill mature security awareness me a
secure richer

138
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:38,310
security program were do you think the
pain points are different

139
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,700
already know my answer to that since I
wrote the other half of the book

140
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,990
it should be good

141
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,420
but I don't know about that you are to
read it and tell us who wrote the better

142
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,010
half at the book

143
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,649
up so I think will spot I and it's not
so much about to buying

144
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,660
whatever appliances newer whatever
program is new with blinking lights are

145
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,680
you know somebody's picture on it

146
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,910
not naming names and that's what we try
to cover in the book How is

147
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,260
if your gonna buy a product if you only
have a limited amount of money

148
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,250
here's what you can get for that here's
where you should put your money you

149
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,070
shouldn't necessarily but your money
here

150
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,120
so it really depends on the size of your
organization

151
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,450
and what your baseline is so folks that
don't really have much of a baseline

152
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,560
I could but kinda takes a little bit
more but delicate touch because this is

153
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,290
a new

154
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,700
the dawning of a new age yes know if you
have in our

155
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,830
an organization and that's not very
security where

156
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,970
that's not going to be an overnight
process so

157
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,060
that's my biggest thing is you know it's
it's going to take time

158
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,959
be patient

159
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,290
pattern of all that Wed its

160
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,600
okay should

161
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,700
so yah depends on min depends on what
works reorganization

162
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,690
arm I don't have many ma points a
reference

163
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,940
the only play a reference I have is the
1i implemented

164
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,420
on it was it was amazing to see

165
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,440
what we could accomplish with not much
money you know we didn't pay for 10 the

166
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,760
link you like boxes

167
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,190
the you know a everything that we tried
was all

168
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,310
open source or something that we build
ourselves

169
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,290
arm it and and being able to see

170
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,370
what we can accomplish I'll

171
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,620
with our own ingenuity and our own
program it still works for us

172
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,760
I mean I've if you have no security
awareness

173
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,790
arm in your organization at all i'd
don't think

174
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,269
at for sure to get a lot of use out over
10 the paid for solutions unless you

175
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:42,769
don't have any money on staff that's

176
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:46,620
a not able to for fill that role

177
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,290
arm E its it's a

178
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,930
you know something that you have to step
through arm

179
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,910
and I think eventually in our
organization would get there that we

180
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,220
would need something more on fine-tuned

181
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,040
but

182
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,320
cell from our perspective a.m.

183
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,839
we we develop what a couple years ago we
felt was a pretty progressive

184
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,120
and when I think a social agenda course
first I think a spear phishing

185
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,329
but we also with the physical so do our
type stuff

186
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:22,130
but but when I think about is is when
the customer came to me one time with

187
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,290
with a spear phishing campaign and they
were successful and

188
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,410
and and my recommendation to them was
hey increase our security awareness

189
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,240
training right whatever the canned
response was which is total bullshit

190
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,730
because and they called me out on it
which is awesome and basically they said

191
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,200
we do training every Mon

192
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,320
this doesn't help me at all in any way
shape or form

193
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,890
so we just change the way that we tested
and and I gotta be honest with you and

194
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,959
I'll let these guys confirmed but

195
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:51,829
an only technical controls really ever
stopped us

196
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:56,290
from you know people are easy to do but
unfortunately because

197
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,560
up the time that we take on offense to
really understand

198
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,380
and what we're gonna need to do so I am

199
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,779
you know when we do physicals we we do
actual

200
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:13,010
was do wreak on for day we have we buy I
class badges we have bad spinners we

201
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,269
make all that stuff

202
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:18,529
and you know we just know that if we
look the part and do that

203
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,880
and I mean how can you really defend
against that and

204
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,470
and most people oh my god I

205
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,700
excuse me but but not but bed

206
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,690
as they were saying think about how you
train your users get it if you train

207
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,600
your users all hover over the link in
the email to all this to

208
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,790
all her campaign's do yet the work
they're meant to cover all the stuff

209
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,050
that you guys are telling them

210
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,290
to look for we're doing all that right
when you hover over

211
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,500
link were not redirect you anywhere it's
legit but there's definitely giveaways

212
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,990
that happened but to but basically a.m.

213
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,420
yeah you gonna have to make sure like
they were saying that you really trainer

214
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,589
users anything about aggressively

215
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:00,800
as attackers were always at that

216
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,079
order I

217
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,579
go out weren't

218
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:14,160
okee basically what you're saying is
that only tactical

219
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,550
solutions stop you guys so we need to go
out and buy

220
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,290
the next-generation firewall the and

221
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,940
the protection from cyber APT in the
clouds

222
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,510
her now you didn't idea and I did not
but I i hack

223
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:35,180
here's what I'd have to say about that
is that I don't think

224
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,290
Yap

225
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,970
here's why I have to say about that
that's understand text

226
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,570
technical defenses work I but

227
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,660
way but but

228
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,769
about right right man

229
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,620
but I have to say the Securities process
not a destination

230
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,470
and even you doing spearfishing on your
own organization

231
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,440
horror as a partner susman as part have
education

232
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,449
and I would say that their problem
wasn't that they didn't have

233
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,860
that they had a security where this
program that they didn't have an

234
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,190
engaging 1

235
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,790
because there's a big difference between
an engaging one and

236
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,899
here watch this video and then take this
test most people will try to click to

237
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:23,089
the test

238
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:26,310
and try to use the law of averages
because they wanna go out and get for

239
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,519
the coffee break

240
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,589
and they don't get anything out of them
so there's

241
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:34,899
things that you have to do I I think
it's not just building security

242
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,190
awareness program you have them

243
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,070
build an engaging one ok here

244
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,620
and you have to make it like an
advertising campaign

245
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,709
it has to be continually can't be even
once a month pretty amazing

246
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:51,980
it has to be continual I think there are
a wide schism

247
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,120
I closer

248
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,180
I'm closer to rate rises never getting
as Mike again I

249
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,899
you you can drop

250
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:09,160
right so I agree with bills points and I
agree with some other

251
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,399
points and I think about that most

252
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,399
mostly Eric spry its but he's my co
author

253
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,410
you

254
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,560
credit yeah but let me get off my
soapbox first then you can ask questions

255
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,970
I was work contractually bail

256
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,509
for the rest okay and one way or another
anyway

257
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:33,670
moving on I it I don't think that has

258
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,399
a great there's no idea I am I don't
think that technology alone is enough

259
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,120
anymore

260
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,509
and I don't think that training alone is
enough anymore

261
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,959
over a taxidermied sure whether they're
plan

262
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,820
like we do them on a red team or a
nation-state planned

263
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,949
they blend both those attack surfaces

264
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:56,350
so until we start training and so we
start targeting

265
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,959
blended attacks will never be able to
defend against them

266
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,660
because that's not what we're looking
for so

267
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,959
um REO like your

268
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,680
said or

269
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,860
and people I see

270
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,019
so net are

271
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,519
you said day

272
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,800
you can't be a good defender any of it
yet

273
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,860
office soul better

274
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,250
than

275
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,220
more great that report no you thanks a
lot

276
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:43,380
now what me now what movement

277
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,480
poppy defenders iraq your or

278
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,480
saying all no I but yeah

279
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,370
he

280
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,680
sold off lawyer 0

281
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,160
for NOP

282
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,220
village gossip order

283
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,299
some coffee all

284
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,650
your her mindset your

285
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,679
start about an their

286
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:24,280

okay my bird year %um

288
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,090
no or 14

289
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,299
so so the one thing that I worried about

290
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:40,580
years right good

291
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,650
help dollar

292
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,299
help as a defender

293
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,539
just hit

294
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:54,700
wall good

295
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,320
whoever hell good

296
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,750
right not every company has a talent and
house concern that people aren't

297
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,110
higher that I liked people are gonna get
spread too thin to

298
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,410
righted so thing

299
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:15,120
up army my fight

300
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,400
history

301
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,809
then I so I think

302
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,580
these guys are brought up a lot agree
points and tears way out social

303
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,590
engineering is not going anywhere
anytime soon

304
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:32,309
you know like dared mention fishing is
is one up prime ones and and we've heard

305
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:35,390
user awareness programs and Weaver
tactical control so on my opinion

306
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,260
nothing to 100 percent you can have the
greatest most effective user awareness

307
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,160
program

308
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,940
and you have the greatest technical
controls in place but ultimately week we

309
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,490
know ways to circumvent those and we
know it only takes one user so

310
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,809
you know fishing doesn't cost that a No
hacker anything so they're gonna send

311
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,940
blindly again it only takes one

312
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,720
oMG in my experiences I think that you
know I'm gonna sound pretty bagger

313
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,530
generic but it's a multi-layered
approach you know you hope to have a

314
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,390
user awareness program in place

315
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,820
you hope to have enough technical
controls that one of them gets triggered

316
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,669
or that something it alerted that you
can investigate it

317
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:09,710
I mean you hope that those things in
place will you know

318
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,450
trigger incident response so that you
can hopefully you know mitigate the risk

319
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,030
before it

320
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,570
really get a hand are but in my
experience is I think that some of the

321
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,480
best

322
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,120
I stuff I've seen is really been
engraved into the culture so the user

323
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,190
awareness program

324
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:27,280
really was in the culture so oMG you
know there are some sort of incentive so

325
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,340
if you found a phishing email in you

326
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,549
you know for that to the help desk are
you would get some sort of compensation

327
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:34,860
are going to a lottery and get you now

328
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,580
some in the process exactly so you know
first thing you gotta have a process

329
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,030
gotta have something in place so they
know what to identify and when they do

330
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,090
you get a reward them because on you
know otherwise why they gonna go and do

331
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,559
something that really isn't the roller
responsibility

332
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,559
and then you know things like physical
testing you know think about when you're

333
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,490
in a corporate officer walking around
and you know you go to the bathroom

334
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:54,910
yacht

335
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,700
you don't know that guy how often do you
really question um oMG you know people

336
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,910
are confrontational

337
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,730
why it's not your roller responsibility
or you know what the hell you doing here

338
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:08,140
who are you you know people don't want
to know what the f it exactly it off

339
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,070
so it's a grill it's really easy for
people just to put their head down

340
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,190
goal and do their work and you know oMG
that's why this is a challenge to great

341
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:16,780
topic

342
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,669
and it's not going away anytime soon up

343
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:24,039
me that I have something to say

344
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:28,140
I

345
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,880
pretty much I mean it

346
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,179
and you know everybody listed some some
really great points and

347
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,110
I really like that that the question
that that the john pointed out which is

348
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,559
that

349
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,299
you know organizations taking Sam effort
to just learn about

350
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:46,090
their network before doing it a pen test
and have a secure engagement that's

351
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:46,950
really effective

352
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,190
you know to Eric's point I gotta agree
with them

353
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,419
all the times I've been stopped Nicole
Danna such a norse specifically an email

354
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,620
phishing attack is because a technical
controls

355
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,549
am NOT referring to a super expensive
legal aid box it someone paid for

356
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:04,610
but things that you can do for free if
you just understand your networking

357
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,270
understand operating systems controls at
our place things like egress filtering

358
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,210
that prevented

359
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,539
the user shall from getting back to my
box things like application whitelisting

360
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,419
that didn't allow them to download
interest binders execution

361
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:18,179
things like taking away local
administrator rights from users say if I

362
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:18,980
could get a shell

363
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,299
I couldn't you know I can prefer just
great in other systems

364
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:25,740
those types of things are said to
controls really help in combination with

365
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,010
a good strong secure user awareness
program

366
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,809
at like Brandon said having that big
into the culture on you know that really

367
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:32,659
helps as well

368
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:36,350
some first and also

369
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,130
yeah I got yeah yeah

370
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,510
okay thank you just you

371
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,960
so I can on a touch on Nov a little bit
the branded thats

372
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,010
Omni as far as the awards based

373
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:56,299
arm user education that's where we made
the biggest leap

374
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,010
on the first time I fish oliver any of
our users

375
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,400
I targeted a thousand of them

376
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,419
I got 600 user names and passwords

377
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,700
like with it was she was a shitty
attempt ill

378
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,900
like complete plain text a link win

379
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,740
you hover did told you that it wasn't
going to do the right thing plays

380
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,059
arm and it was from my gmail address a
was horrible

381
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:25,179
absolutely horrible and he still all
clicked on it and gave me their

382
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,370
usernames and passwords

383
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:32,140
after that then are that sea levels like
holy shit maybe we should do something

384
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,159
about this

385
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,789
and on then we started to do the awards
base so

386
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:41,020
you know just like you mentioned if if
if you teach them that it's not a bad

387
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,020
thing to report anomalies

388
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,559
going to report it more often they have
in the senate have they're like hey you

389
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,950
know look at this I just got this
awesome gift card

390
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,809
or or whatever they're going to it's
going to spread by word of mouth you're

391
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:56,570
not going to have to do much marketing

392
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,220
arm you know we we do it once a month

393
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,789
and it IDs amazing at how much

394
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:07,640
headway we've gained I think we went
from sixty percent

395
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,840
army being fished n0 reports

396
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,590
to 2 percent being fished in 25 report
quite 25 percent reports

397
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,440
it's amazing like I I totally agree that
we heed

398
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,480
P rate keeps hoop

399
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,270
I it always needs up in your hand

400
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,110

404
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,400
well regret mission was successful

405
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,990
let me get on my soapbox first and that

410
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,850
hall any

411
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,860

argue

415
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,990
um it up personally we deal we have we
have

416
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,549
a lotta lotta love technical controls we
actually have

417
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:02,919
a on a home-built %ah

418
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,320
Linux box that controls all over male
faltering

419
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,549
from the outside we are on our last
contest we

420
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:13,909
actually I love hurts

421
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:17,350
Forlan nerd well only for a week

422
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:21,159
um we actually stopped our last pen test

423
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,440
with those technical controls and had to
scale them back

424
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,640
sore users could be tested are you know
there's there's anti-virus there's

425
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,870
blacklisting this gray listing there's
all these different technical control

426
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,220
that you can have in place

427
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,350
as well as teaching them

428
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,029
if you're not expecting it or it looks I
had or

429
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:46,630
if and now week have people reporting a
mean you can omit reporting too much but

430
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:47,380
there

431
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,360
you know they signed up for mailing list
or something and they're like oh my god

432
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,590
that they're trying to fish me

433
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:57,850
now you you sign up for it but it's
better

434
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:04,850
qarax

435
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,590
me

436
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,990
change credit card company I

437
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,779
yet

438
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:22,070
right

439
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,360
yes yes

440
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,500
they are it and it's and it's common

441
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,500
unfortunately who's next Iran intact
here

442
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,100
sorry I as it is so I as I'm ahead of
the brand about specific niche your

443
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,590
point about

444
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,820
are things that catch it %uh all up and
tell you about how we actually do it so

445
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,029
it doesn't take a

446
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:46,330
yeah I think I think questions great you
know isn't there spam filters in place

447
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,150
like that

448
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:50,870
and and it's a great concept but this
kind of law designed to spam filters

449
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,029
really are based off a threshold it's
not a black-and-white

450
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,570
oMG you know you get to determine your
threshold could determine what paper

451
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:57,890
things

452
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,360
up the threshold in any benchley when
you had a point system you know it goes

453
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,400
in the spam filter

454
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
arms without real black and white and
%ah says penetration testers we

455
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,110
understand those type a technical

456
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,370
controls you have in place so some
things that will flag spam filters for

457
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,090
example

458
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,679
om let's say at home yet working from
home

459
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,059
armed subject lines things like that
domains and stuff so

460
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:23,399
when I'm doing fishing I will I will
register a valid domain name

461
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,460
and now when i buy that domain name I
will configure MX records which makes my

462
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,520
domain name

463
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,919
I mind domain able to basically except
emails

464
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,429
so when a spam filter received an email
from me the first thing it probably

465
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:37,520
looks at his hair

466
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,909
does this domain have an MX record and I
do and

467
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,480
the reasons gonna look at that is
because why would any spam filter allow

468
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,029
in email

469
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:49,980
to a domain that doesn't have an MX
record because that is what's required

470
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,049
to reply and get the email back

471
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:56,330
om other things like sender policy
framework other mitigating controls like

472
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:01,100
spf which I basically you can configure
on your domain so we can say

473
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:06,039
hey this is my mail server when I send
email on behalf of this domain

474
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:09,850
it will come from this specific you know
IP address for this mail server so

475
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,820
when we buy the domain we also send up
sender policy framework so you're

476
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,919
your fancy technology like spam filters
when they're looking at my domain

477
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,220
everything checks out perfect and so
that threshold

478
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,020
is really low I'm basically ballad email
at that time

479
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,799
and he brought up what about attachments
and things like that so my emails

480
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,490
typically don't include attachments cuz
I know you have anti-virus

481
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,190
arm scanning it before it ever gets put
into an inbox

482
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,760
and I know that attachment typically
bring up the threshold

483
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,390
so my emails are very om generic to
contain taxed in a link and when I wanna

484
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,770
do is I wanna link them to a website

485
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,000
where they're going to have to download
something malicious and again

486
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,940
om you might have a web proxy server in
place where you don't allow download on

487
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,950
your network right

488
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,990
well I've we do this properly and we can
figure HTTPS with SSL

489
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,059
a lot of firewalls majority the
firewalls can't see inside that ass

490
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:08,630
assault on also maybe you have a policy
in place to block the download

491
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,880
but we have an encrypted tunnel and your
fancy firewall can see inside the tunnel

492
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,110
therefore doesn't know you're
downloading malicious content and now

493
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,559
we've got malicious content

494
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:21,230
on your user's workstation and
essentially at that time we bypassed a

495
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,110
lot of technical controls and again it

496
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,250
all about how many technical controls in
place could maybe we got

497
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,520
all the way to that place but like he
mentioned application whitelisting so my

498
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,380
binary

499
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:36,049
doesn't match what's allowed and boom i
attacked it stop such all about layers

500
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,830
and it's all about you know from our
perspective understanding what a

501
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,480
player's might stop us

502
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,049
and we do things on purpose to try to
bypass those technique patrols

503
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:49,970
in at the great thing about the way we
fish

504
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,049
and and the way pry in a most people
share it is

505
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:56,809
we are testing in every control along
the way we're testing the people

506
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:59,549
are they going to cut the link where
tests in the AB that exists on the

507
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:00,460
system

508
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,260
were testing are they actually fall in
the process I mean how many times have

509
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,630
you gotten an email

510
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,539
he thought was malicious and silicon the
helpdesk you called your body and I D

511
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,580
right and that stole the outside the
process so you know we're testing the

512
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,279
people there and the technologies

513
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:19,309
should yeah I think Ballard I

514
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:22,980
thank you Eric have a drink

515
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,470
chaat Hills wheeling

516
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:32,309
okay no I'm do it by myself I

517
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:36,309
let me make one only and I'll much say
anything else rest

518
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:40,020
well

519
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:46,600
to thinks one here

520
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,020
the when you talk about layers what
we're talking about here and why air

521
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,049
excited about is testing

522
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:58,460
the fence in debt you're not ever gonna
keep everyone from getting your network

523
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,760
but you need to be able to detect and
get them out your network before they

524
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,049
take anything valuable

525
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:08,440
stop topic

526
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,840
now where gonna happen you get yes

527
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,110
and so they're not reading of with your
Active Directory domain creds

528
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,220
in and a the secret formula for Coke

529
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,740
so you think it to think about what
you're protecting ago

530
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:31,740
I it was an aspirin factor eight up

531
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:38,059
now on our sister the treatment the
other thing is you have to think about

532
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:42,980
the people that you're training it's not
all tissues awareness training it's also

533
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:48,809
don't forget the IT department they may
not be savvy enough

534
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:53,029
as far as awareness training to
understand what it is so they have to

535
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:54,899
have awareness training as well

536
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:58,429
and they also have to understand that
you have policies and procedures in

537
00:31:58,429 --> 00:31:59,559
place

538
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:04,610
still help them I am I been in
organizations where

539
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,570
you know they thought I was there to get
them fired you might know I'm here to

540
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,850
help you not to get you fired

541
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:14,019
I am that people people

542
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:18,419
bill our right people need non-fat
solar-powered from the top down so it's

543
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:25,159
not just users it's also managers it's
also the IT department

544
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,539
in I'm sorry I just have to keep this

545
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:32,799
get back at one small success story and
then

546
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,789
all online okay so I I do a lot I love

547
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:41,130
fishing assessments an external kinda
somewhat not and

548
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,130
I had a recent were nervous for critical
infrastructure provider

549
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,640
so this should help everybody sleep a
little bit better tonight

550
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,960
Physiol you might actually have power
cuz that's awesome

551
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,879
so client was an electrical I

552
00:32:53,879 --> 00:32:58,659
distributor and that there are going to
come in and do a fishing as admin

553
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:02,029
but they're so active in there were no
its program that there there fishing

554
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:02,309
people

555
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:05,320
every week rats so they're they're on
top of this all the time

556
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,489
so they're doing the awareness to doing
testing they have the technology in

557
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:09,950
place

558
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,840
so when I bought my domain and I
registered my SSL certificate no use the

559
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,659
MX record you know everything lines up
technically

560
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:20,860
Mikes sweet are let's go so four emails

561
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,340
salsa four emails three shells

562
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,940
unlike who I thought you said you had a
good awareness program I just got a 75

563
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,090
percent success rate

564
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,989
so I'm doing my happy group dance rape
on checking out the network like this is

565
00:33:33,989 --> 00:33:34,710
awesome

566
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,869
look at this machine look at that
machine 10 minutes then

567
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:40,999
all officials are Mike what is this no

568
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:45,239
what my shows back are looking to
economic stuff use a number for

569
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:48,929
25 percent coronet this email exchange

570
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:53,149
I don't know this person reported it so
in 10 minutes

571
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:56,769
they reported and then they use the
technology that they had in place right

572
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:59,509
race on exchange the user and point
technology

573
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:02,879
to pull those machines of the network
like that they did Lynn and took that

574
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:03,379
machines

575
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:07,139
spoke with so when you put this program
together properly

576
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:10,460
it really does work but you have to have
the people

577
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,950
in the technology together so this is
bells little secret a

578
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:19,609
awareness training the point of
awareness training is to train your user

579
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:20,299
various

580
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:23,780
to identify something that looks unusual
and ask for help

581
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,299
you're not supposed to train them to be
a security professional

582
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:31,079
that's your job they just need to know
how to be a rock in accounting

583
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,490
and the other spot something that looks
a little strange and call and get some

584
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:34,859
help

585
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,710
now we can move on you can

586
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,290
but I will hand good

587
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,549
I

588
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:48,970
I

589
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:52,280
took I i'm sorry said

590
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,569
do these are to do to get it's really
critical point that any a lot of the

591
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:57,410
social engineering attacks in 10 testing

592
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,980
on don't really detail is looked is
lacking in that

593
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,280
we get shells you need to get using the
password it's like no big deal

594
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,829
on which is what the sea levels are
bergen is even get reports a dick

595
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:09,760
fucking your you get

596
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,990
20 shelled using passwords to remember
the detail in like

597
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:17,589
impact I'm a lot and I know you do I
knew

598
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:21,309
do you but love the company's I mean we
see the reports just like

599
00:35:21,309 --> 00:35:24,960
did this Seiko you that show that's
great you know we have you seen passage

600
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,569
great but

601
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:29,309
would you do the house is actually
impact your bottom line

602
00:35:29,309 --> 00:35:32,309
young so mean leading part in that is by

603
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:35,930
that card issuers we doing this work
were no spending thirty forty billable

604
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,910
hours were ready at this caller reported

605
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,970
pie charts and graphs and shit new hide
media blows them actually saying you

606
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,270
know

607
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:46,180
this is how we're gonna fuck you yen

608
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,760
reading yep cell

609
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,130
him I mean yeah

610
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,480
Sep yeah

611
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,020
set so I agree with keys but

612
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,380
the problem is you guys if you're if
you're our customers

613
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,970
and you're not latina ass do it that's
on you

614
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,250
it's not my fault because I will go as
far as you want me to go

615
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,079
and you know usually within 20 minutes
getting a shell

616
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:18,170
I've got your anti DS that debt local on
my system n

617
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,329
I've got has cat fired up and crack in
it

618
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:24,460
or I'm and looking for PI ir pH II

619
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,690
because like keith was saying the real
impact that we want to show

620
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,869
is we want to show you how quick

621
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:36,849
and how devastating it is to gain access
to your sensitive information

622
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:40,130
and get axle traded from a network it's
just not about getting an

623
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,440
about finding it and getting it out so
again there's more layers

624
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,890
I've up defending against that so I

625
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:52,049
I wanted to move the topic on businesses
actually question that I I really want

626
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:53,680
an answer from you guys because I do
this

627
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,530
we do this all the time and it's there
and I always wondered so

628
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,329
amway when we when I Pentastar SMS
Peachtree St

629
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:05,680
when we've had tests that it has a
haitian hit

630
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,420
when we've had to ask what I am looking
for personally

631
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,880
is I want to find the domain admin
service account that you have not

632
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,369
changed in twenty years

633
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:18,069
because I know that if I grab a hold of
that

634
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,260
account that you have no fucking clue

635
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,359
what it does and you're not to change
the password and they're not gonna shut

636
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:24,980
it down

637
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,309
and and it's good to show that that's
liability because you change your user

638
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:32,960
password every 90 days but I guarantee
your service cancer be changed but

639
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,540
maybe once and they might so have a lamb
and hash even on the main control

640
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,760
thats all there so my kid

641
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,720
overall I'll your

642
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,180
that talk about 99 percent of
organizations are so-called

643
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,920
yet that's yes yep and

644
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,950
syntax yet when we changed passer les

645
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,190
week at it again so so my question is

646
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:05,369
WYD anybody out here be able to know if
your domain admin Metro

647
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:08,809
and how okay how

648
00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:15,319
and how all so I'm not a salesperson
Bowie's metrics

649
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:18,640
and no better home

650
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,309
alright sold don't know

651
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:26,619

I don't I don't know I don't I don't
write stuff um

654
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:40,920
so no it hmm so if you get the username
and password we can tell but he created

655
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,010
a domain admin we have cell-free

656
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,970
yes cell so we we've had penned testers
create so we can tell that within a

657
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,609
couple minutes but this is not the right
with a spoon

658
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:54,140
they put yeah oh yeah oh yah and then

659
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:58,369
questionnaire tell administrator

660
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,540

yes yes yes are dinner

667
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:31,339
some here but same thing is it's a
ballot person doing exactly what to

668
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:32,540
expect on your network

669
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,799
how do you know yes exactly exam

670
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:39,720
and endured in you're definitely on
point about the whole

671
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,940
we can change the domain I mean I have
some really

672
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,670
I really really bad horror stories
tonight yeah I mean we're

673
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,660
yeah when pressing Amir him this was
about

674
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:55,730
Howard people all of press over the last
three years we went to the point where

675
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,950
we had a four character domain admin
password no

676
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,109
that hadn't been changed in 10 years

677
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,290
to being able to change in every 60 days
so happy attack

678
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:08,950
let's talk about how to detect night I
bring that up to the customer I want to

679
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,660
give them

680
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,910
I want to take what you guys tell me
give them about solution other than

681
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,160
you know especially if it's someone who
actively works there

682
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,200
and if they've gone rogue what to look
where

683
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,559
where people of or how

684
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,740
the guy here under network is gone rogue
is what I'm saying I'll

685
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:32,309
to detect that then you're screwed well
there's gotta be a way

686
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:35,599
I all hope is not

687
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,569
fired Jeff

688
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:43,809
important one person have

689
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:47,069
that much power 30 okay

690
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:51,250
you'd up that's a lot of paperwork

691
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,990
I mean that we have a daughter her
daughter daughter

692

and you register at had a solution
psychiatrist

693
00:40:58,049 --> 00:41:05,049
here

694
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,540
policy percy are different from
technical control

695
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:21,540
or 45

696
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,029
I think right all

697
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:30,079
about yet servicing

698
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,400
absolutely lol

699

day in llego

701
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,180
good do that all hardware

702
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,770
said

703
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:54,650
fires wreck network with a

704
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,170
people yes that that all

705
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:02,190
that should more

706
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,720
I'll from problem with this

707
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,000
drive or

708
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,950
don't have pro go

709
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,170
red if I want mostar

710
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,299
network this you

711
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:22,790
now right rule that works for this
activity

712
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,880
the sources fire and

713
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,230
on the or like domain administrator
login

714
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,160
you a avonex portrayed it of getting a
date of the domain controller

715
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,060
we have a role for yes should

716
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,609
I of at the Edward snowden rule

717
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:48,549
it just it's just when you have somebody
that try

718
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:52,079
how do you know when you can no longer
trust them on your network

719
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,310
went we'll we don't trust each other

720
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:59,049
enough to share the tide rations needs
to be shared

721
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:02,619
in order to controls in place

722
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:05,619
and that that y la to routines are

723
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:09,660
her be

724
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,990
they don't know through through

725
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,589
I'll that red or

726
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:19,630
or red are Wow to perform

727
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,900
through hardcore there's an

728
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,290
and at work about everything

729
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:31,369
are all your matters weenie

730
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:34,680
shared now I just gonna say

731
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,950
you know it the rogue IT employees just
an example you know to be the same thing

732
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,450
that

733
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,259
ID employees got compromise and some
other clear text password so it's not

734
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:45,690
related to trust it is related to these

735
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:50,589
powerful accounts and how can you detect
anomalies with these powerful accounts

736
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:50,930
like

737
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,900
like we've been talking about your talk
for next year's Derby

738
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,849
who'd

739
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:05,849
I'd up

740
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:11,099
make where now

741
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:14,720
you know the

742
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,859
yeses question a back I was doing my
phil donahue but out the cap to go that

743
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:25,859
far

744
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:33,750
happen the question is how do you combat

745
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:38,180
crypto lock blocker or a thread like
that

746
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,710
well they have all the crew to lock the
keys are available now so it doesn't

747
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,430
really matter in

748
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:49,020
not a clue an extra I created by
withdraw 13 us

749
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:55,200
us that I other work reply kar Lai Jie
PO's but what a pain in the ass to

750
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,560
configure

751
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,450
as being the only person that touches
your policy our organization I was

752
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,910
having to add every rival Java as a
white lists

753
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:11,910
to hunt

754
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,060
no have I have personally seen it

755
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:21,329
I've heard a yeah

756
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:25,450
I haven't seen it in the enterprise that
also leads to %um

757
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:29,160
a big thing that we always call out to
you is is network segmentation

758
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,730
how many I mean that's the number one
thing we call on every single

759
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:38,799
I'd gauge men out not only can I get to
your CEO's desk top 10 plugin in here in

760
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:41,240
the conference room and get your net
after

761
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,259
your net filers all that stuff abt you
know

762
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:49,839
all the bad stuff so and I i mean that's
definitely one other things where

763
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,910
and we take advantage I have and any any

764
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:57,250
it someone in let's say someone going
back to fish if someone hr's

765
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:01,990
fished I do you have segmentation place
at one at the stats the defense and

766
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,900
that's right

767
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:09,720
that that we need to look at

768
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,700
going up and Eni's absolutely right
segmentation will really do a lot

769
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,759
the other thing I have to say is a we
just released a

770
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:24,060
project in any that will basically
monitor each where those segments for

771
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:29,290
threats to get behind a firewall called
network Scout check it out runs on a

772
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,890
Raspberry Pi list

773
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,950
yet she is completely student research
the

774
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:38,950
check it out that's a that a whatever
years

775
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:43,160
that it's not one thing is not going to
protect you from everything

776
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,609
it's all this together as a process that
really lets you guys sure almost

777
00:46:47,609 --> 00:46:48,790
depressing me

778
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:54,270
I mean it's like there's no end security
awareness won't work

779
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,270
work guys no it's not

780
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:00,509
proper empty when the

781
00:47:00,509 --> 00:47:04,140
good help cell

782
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,609
cell we talk about user awareness we
talk about to controls in this

783
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:11,029
to there's one thing in common with both
does and those are

784
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:15,040
after fact that's something that we do
after the organization has been

785
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,509
developed after the IT systems
infrastructures been designed

786
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:22,410
and now we're trying to put these
band-aids on these these flaws that were

787
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:22,930
built

788
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:27,079
to begin with we about security way

789
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:30,579
Asian yet cell so I think

790
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:32,720
you know one of the key things when
you're doing any type of information

791
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,920
security testing

792
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,200
and and you're giving techno
recommendations is really looking at the

793
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,230
system from a whole

794
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,910
and and and are the areas to redesign an
Aries to go back obviously if you're an

795
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,839
internal blue team era network defender

796
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,180
and and that the dentist comes in says
you need to redesign your home network

797
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,180
IVC three heads up and you say well
that's that's going to take way too much

798
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,420
you know effort on way too much money we
can't do that but you know certain

799
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,220
things that just network segmentation I
mean just having ACLs and and and and

800
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,900
and making it so that if I do sneak into
the conference room

801
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,440
because I printed a fake badge and i
plug in I can't get anywhere those types

802
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,509
of things are gonna make

803
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:08,770
much more of an impact in even the most
robust user awareness train or the

804
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:09,349
robust

805
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:12,450
technical controls out there that

806
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:16,430
the

807
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:23,430
did the

808
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:29,170
bump

809
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,960
head or overall

810
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,069
home lauded for

811
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:40,339
her they're good you

812
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:45,130
summer make all Cup

813
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,290
no make known

814
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:53,540
on yep

815
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,430
in bash oh I saw II rar

816
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:01,069
I come back out and

817
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:04,819
well as I relate I saw that a rap

818
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:11,819
you know about I'd I would

819
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:19,750
you and then no

820
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:24,890
in happened like will you have a good

821
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:28,460
you correct are you gonna keep them at
bay long enough

822
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,660
that you detect something and are able
to act react

823
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:35,500
but we this is it's a horrible thing to
say but we always

824
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,779
do say it and I think everybody agrees

825
00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:42,730
a defender has to defend every fucking
possible way and do

826
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,990
at attack early needs one but

827
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,849
in order to left bill spirits I want to
tell a success story have one of our

828
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:52,650
customers

829
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:57,029
it yeah that's right and this is
actually true story

830
00:49:57,029 --> 00:50:01,029
so and is a minute mark know Mark boss
pure hate

831
00:50:01,029 --> 00:50:05,400
yeah so he's afraid he's a isn't okay
pen tester at

832
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,859
so he done this customer the year before
and got assigned to me this year

833
00:50:09,859 --> 00:50:13,210
and he's like get parking lot right a.m.

834
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,000
so we we always only say things like a I
got physical control of an asset is game

835
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,719
over things like that

836
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:24,509
and so I I can't mention who they are
what they do but I can tell you that day

837
00:50:24,509 --> 00:50:27,680
had the most secure network

838
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,830
in the world they're not in security

839
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:34,750
I they're not in nuclear physician or
anything like that

840
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,390
by it actually made me cry I got nowhere

841
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,469
and did nothing and it was awesome
though because now I have something

842
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:44,089
where I can say

843
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:47,119
mister customer you can't bitch and
complain

844
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,460
these people did it over here yet well
they've got three thousand people but

845
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,910
what they've done a scaleable

846
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:56,500
and what they did was they use tools
like BitLocker

847
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,819
and a all the free Microsoft shit

848
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:04,390
but they understood their network they
understood their people

849
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:08,520
and the implemented it and they also got
car blotch by in a bar I think that's

850
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,710
another thing to do is

851
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:14,270
as a lot of IT people don't really show
the value

852
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:19,119
about that look writing by

853
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,359
building sure

854
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:26,270
right think that's why we've been so
successful he has

855
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:29,270
such that by here

856
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,369
security reached thats right

857
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:35,369
be proactive not reactive

858
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:39,619
right go provide

859
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:43,190
really strong reports that not just say
hey I popped a boxing at the shows you

860
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,210
have is one abilities but

861
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:47,810
to really communicate a picture what
this means to your business

862
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:51,859
and just how catastrophic it is that you
have JBoss with admin

863
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:55,460
admin sitting on the Internet that's
something that we can do to help to get

864
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:58,969
you know finding in to get buy-in from
you know the high-level management

865
00:51:58,969 --> 00:52:04,819
right get managed you

866
00:52:04,819 --> 00:52:08,119
we get there we get that all the time by
and clients are saying you know I've

867
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:10,279
been telling manager we want to do XYZ

868
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:13,690
arm and then we come in and we told to
do actually the in the next year they

869
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,950
got the budget sorry I

870
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:18,569
a lot of people are very happy for us to
come in and do that they protesting cuz

871
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:22,279
the use that as leverage they need an
outsider so on that I always love when I

872
00:52:22,279 --> 00:52:25,849
ask us mass every custom for start the
Pentax what is the one thing that I

873
00:52:25,849 --> 00:52:28,349
could do to make this an absolute
slam-dunk for you

874
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:33,270
and now is love and it's rare but I love
when they respond scare the shit outta

875
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:34,049
my manager

876
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:37,150
if you could scare the shit outta my
manager that would be the best need to

877
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,069
do and I always

878
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:41,690
I was forget about that because I know
that nizar gonna be fun for me

879
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:45,000
but hopeful I can actually provide some
value in actually in a

880
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,520
so that's always that I was getting

881
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,219
great I don't even know I read on

882
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:55,380
yet said

883
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,480
well yeah I didn't say that we're all
but two talk as we r gap

884
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,480
any more questions and a very you

885
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,440
I don't know which and whatever have a
black shirt I

886
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:14,440
heat

887
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,640
plus know huh so the one that we went
with

888
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,190
on we were given a budget a thousand
dollars right

889
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:28,619
which doesn't seem like a whole lot when
you consider what people

890
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:31,690
yeah what what people pay for this type
of program

891
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:35,230
from the outside are we did like ahh

892
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:38,549
we give away twenty dollars to two
people on

893
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:42,759
every month every quarter it's like

894
00:53:42,759 --> 00:53:46,230
40 box and then we have a and the your
price for 400

895
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:50,500
Beckham article like yes yeah throughout
throughout the

896
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,230
are on my bro I've been doing it for to
nine months now

897
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:58,270
match we just started in and January and
each

898
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:01,779
each time it gets a little bit more
difficult for them to

899
00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:05,690
I realize that that's been that it's
from in

900
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:09,950
from the inside not only do they get put
in the little drawing for when it comes

901
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:10,200
from

902
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,380
internally if they catch something from
the outside they also get put in

903
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,500
comp firing them

904
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,560
and they are worried about that yes

905
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,040
essence for them do it Journal

906
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,160
years nice about streamline

907
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,440
the strip always care never yep

908
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,549
always workers

909
00:54:33,549 --> 00:54:40,549
right other question

910
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:54,160
