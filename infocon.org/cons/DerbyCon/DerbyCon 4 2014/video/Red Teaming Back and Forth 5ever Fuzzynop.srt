1
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:29,279
go

2
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,330
hi everyone can hear me OK

3
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,150
cool cool so I'm obviously not

4
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,240
or Josh Schwartz hanging on it be
chaired that the other or not I don't

5
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,540
know

6
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,720
%uh so this talk is red teaming

7
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,440
back and forth by the ever on you can
like this if you cry every time

8
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,240
and if you get that reference you should
laugh yeah like two people that's what I

9
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,600
thought

10
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,000
so hun this is actually my port director
Nikon my purse here speaking here so I'm

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,420
really excited to be doing that

12
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,250
um okay but I want lights are the survey

13
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,690
arm you can go ahead agrees on hand to
read the finger-like

14
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,080
not do something like that but who here
is on

15
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,600
RED team and that's like anyone who
breaks up for a jog Redeemer's and

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,270
esters

17
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,990
you know maybe people who read exploits
how about people who do that kind of

18
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,360
stuff in their free time

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,479
your okay have a blue team who's that
his the blue team people here

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,080
anyone is keeping things secure
protecting askin

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,299
anyone on drug team that's what the
house so early geez

22
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:11,140
Mon on good job I guess so yes anyone so
hungover from last night

23
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,940
yeah and cool

24
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,500
so a bit of an outline on I'm gonna
biggest talk on the two parts

25
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,930
%uh the first part gonna talk a lot
about penetration tests when i think is

26
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,269
bad with them when I don't really like
about them

27
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,570
and I have a philosophical anecdote
which I may be able to explain so that

28
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,360
it makes sense

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,430
but maybe not om and i wanna talk about
some 360 no scope

30
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,440
Yolo swag or at least my perception

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,769
that on and on the second part we're
going to do a we're gonna talk about

32
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,340
twelve step process

33
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,820
and dominoes in recent demos NBC heavies

34
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,680
you know you get that you get that you
purchased your entire

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,910
are I sound here

36
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,780
her up their sound there maybe not

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,510
on you're better off without actually

38
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,549
so on type a pen testing right the pen
is tested

39
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,459
some turning issues they're little bit
but whatever so out you know what's

40
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,790
worse case scenario right you get a pen
past

41
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,769
and everyone's like yes the pen worked
fine we check your check boxes

42
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:21,939
everyone's happy com thats not get

43
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:25,560
right no one likes right has anyone had
a penthouse like that before dawn a

44
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,950
penthouse like that before

45
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,170
on has like that for sucks so hoping it
isn't you because it's really

46
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,939
frustrating rightly know when you're
doing it you're like of am i can.

47
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,450
that it's not like I was boring a so

48
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,129
here's how to tell right if you're
getting is and has and they're not quite

49
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,769
up to you it's not right there's no user
attacks right

50
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,450
never get any real demonstration impact
crater I paid

51
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,470
there's this portability here you should
take a look bad

52
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,909
great like that did you happy with it
you compromise me with it

53
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:00,230
answer is no then like well how am I
gonna take that

54
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,720
and has recorded and use it to you
inaction change with my organization

55
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,400
like an

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,489
he didn't do anything so I don't know
and

57
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:11,500
sources like no validation findings
Great Lakes take here in per

58
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,629
and upper said you might have this this
thing over here

59
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,510
potential you know cross-site request
forgery going on like every page that

60
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,250
you browse to integrate well as an
internal Portofino never had set so

61
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,710
how's that affecting what doesn't so I'm

62
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,880
you know and endorses nor is all has
anyone ever done append hasn't got no

63
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,120
results at all

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,970
whole so the

65
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,120
water to people so like yeah no results
China

66
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,690
did you make up some results kinda
Flickr so suddenly the scope up ownage

67
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,870
gets a lot shallower like yeah like well
you guys got you know I'm

68
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,900
don't John secure Cookies enabled so
think that

69
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,580
so I think a penthouse should always
have results

70
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,000
so if there's no results your scope was
too tight

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,440
he was too tight great because you can
always getting

72
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,610
there's always a way in said he didn't
get results it's because they give us.

73
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,320
goal a targeted stop that they know
there's not been anything there

74
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,390
so widen the scope and if you're on that
if you're that guy that's on that and

75
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,270
has not got

76
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,590
had you might like what is the scope
like 3 IP's

77
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,910
just like web servers and you know hate
you hold on it's

78
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,610
I'm just here to check box form you
should talk to point of contact and

79
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,950
letting you do more stop so that he gets
his money where otherwise you know

80
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,400
they're just

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,340
third whatever throwing money away right
up

82
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,160
the reason they probably do that is the
Europe acknowledging her having those

83
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,230
security flaws right because there's a
lot

84
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,020
easier to get that had passed and you
like yea like Penn has the came back

85
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,800
clean

86
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,860
okay %ah in on the findings

87
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,060
right there they're easier to deal with
than and having a breach

88
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,580
so you should you should find it finals
findings before you have that reach

89
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,870
the real ones you know not like my users
get pitched in

90
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,910
once again the corporate network
everyone gets on not like 3i

91
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,660
he's been come back with anything
significant okay

92
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,340
so philosophical anecdote bear with me
here so there's a guy

93
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,430
the scenic coastal at he wrote a book
called The Black Swan

94
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,800
highly recommend it not he's an
economist he talks a lot about perceived

95
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,640
randomness

96
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,940
I he's the kind of guy who's like if you

97
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,760
described ice or a casino game is random
he's actually like

98
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,090
physically upset maybe bombing because
he's like that's not a random

99
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,360
you know you roll a dice and you get 1
through 6

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,880
even if you roll the dice you got 13
million

101
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,220
but still not rampant you know all the
outcomes

102
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,340
you know every outcome that advice has
like randomness is this

103
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,920
you roll a dice and it turns into a duck
and that Doc like

104
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,480
shit on your front lawn & flies up in
pics you in the eye and turns into a

105
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,970
sugar cube and swinger party but that's
random

106
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,490
thats really random no one saw that
coming

107
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,710
ever

108
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,260
so he described this thing called the
Black Swan back then

109
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,450
on a per unit of carrots a metaphor that
describes an event that comes as a

110
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,200
surprise has a major effect

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,320
and is often inappropriately rationalize
after the fact that the benefit of

112
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,970
hindsight

113
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,190
he's not talking about security
vulnerabilities here

114
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,450
can you see how that might apply I

115
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,810
I don't know what what new security
vulnerability that came out now it's at

116
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,430
on the only thing people can think about

117
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,190
maybe the new one actually have had a
chance to relax are getting pummeled in

118
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,630
the coral in class all week but

119
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,840
YUM maybe maybe this isn't a big deal as
you think but

120
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,870
I can occur think and also a whole for
my current engagement but I'm running

121
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,400
that it is it gonna use it

122
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,530
but think about harpley right hurt we
cannot in everyone's like

123
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,900
on her plea her you heard from her we
hardly yet what about all the other

124
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,170
stuff by the pink heart read the thing
that's going to get upon

125
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,210
and sure you know it's a vulnerability
but it's just another one in a huge

126
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:52,810
sOooo

127
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,220
but because it's like a big event
everyone

128
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,610
rationalize it differently after the
fact thinking that it's more likely to

129
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,340
happen again or something similar

130
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,330
now

131
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,290
in his book to talk some other guy
Oberto echo in this October ako

132
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,050
character

133
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,280
he's Italian writer philosopher up

134
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,270
he has something which is a consider a
very very large personal library

135
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,510
this library has about 30,000 books in
it and I he basically

136
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,260
categorized as people into two
categories: people to categorize

137
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,080
quiet one cat no Disney so when people
visit him

138
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,270
the visit his huge library to see it
30,000 looks quite a lot

139
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,219
and coming home man generator leads when
I

140
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,980
be there come in and they're like a Wow
you have such

141
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,820
a huge collection of books how many have
you read and then he categories other

142
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,050
people the SparkPeople

143
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,150
who realize that it's not about how how
many

144
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,080
outta 30,000 books that you red but the
stuff that you

145
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,110
know that you haven't read you have in
your library

146
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,369
know that you haven't read it

147
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:08,069
now I'm sure we all have he's got books
in their library that they haven't read

148
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:13,149
daddy to you like all of them right but

149
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,779
I know that that information's available
me if I needed so

150
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:21,740
the general abstraction is that the
value of the things you do not know

151
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,339
sometimes far outweighs the value of the
things you know

152
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,029
and people have a tendency to hang on to
those things that thing

153
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:33,279
no you find out something you know it
and that's all you focus on

154
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,879
but which need to be doing is thinking
and trying to enumerate and trying to

155
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,040
find the things that you

156
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,160
don't know about right that's those are
the things that always get us right

157
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
those are the things that

158
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,269
no ODIs shit right so is on another
philosophical think that made sense but

159
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,540
I got through it so let's go for our

160
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,970
people found work in who is your

161
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,779
red teaming 360 no scope Yolo swag

162
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,170
arm so this is kinda Center allow

163
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,759
this is kind of my initial pots about
red teaming when I switched from being

164
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,509
consulting pen tester into like red
teaming where did

165
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:16,920
the scope goes away you know the goal is
to simulate

166
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,459
but in real threat actor the goal is to
do whatever

167
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:25,929
so there's no there's no school and
you're supposed to be testing the fences

168
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:29,470
in real time instead of just probing for
vulnerabilities right you have to think

169
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,970
about a lot of things you didn't happen
think about before

170
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,230
the consulting has a lot of times you
nine's comments

171
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,759
and whatever its fine and I when you
ready Mike I was I'm sport

172
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,429
is because I can do whatever and I think
about all the other things

173
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:47,660
so a lot about in limini

174
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,670
illuminating ya know I so

175
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,649
here's mine twelve steps to read covery
this is

176
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:59,559
you know how to how to read team good
and you get things and I hope we not get

177
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,019
caught

178
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:04,379
and you've had a great time so here's
the scenario: Scott actually was like up

179
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:05,290
at 6am

180
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,839
today and I updated the slide the first
time a given stock

181
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,810
was I like a really small conference I
passed out

182
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,829
and I get a stipend like this is a
boring side because I i'm talking about

183
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:17,410
his goal

184
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,970
which but here's the does the first
goals hack all the things cause damage

185
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,529
horizon life or property right those are
the goals to be ready in case

186
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,899
I thought you know where the actual
calls right its

187
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:32,290
being a change catalyst for that
organization

188
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,980
weather in house or whether consulting
so that they can come back

189
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,209
and you like look we need to make our
security better

190
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:43,720
someone EADS that Penn pass to get
hopefully someone you've got and has

191
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,759
so that they can get things done they
need you to happen so that they can

192
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,230
make people do things and

193
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,610
they needed as leverage if they're just
checking the PCI compliance text box

194
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,079
then

195
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,810
you know you party you've already failed
at getting that engagement that you want

196
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,019
by Tom and then the goal so that like
with my goal when I'm doing

197
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,890
looking like a badass right you get you
can't role in an

198
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,290
in and you like it is no mister your kid

199
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,090
checkbox now yeah but we only you
hahahahaha

200
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,520
saw those are those are the real goal I
guess

201
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,640
so there's a couple restrictions that
normally get place even when you're

202
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,110
operating in this Israel so

203
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,960
noted I'll service where you can take
companies down and be like haha

204
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,640
we did anonymous however you and now you
know you're screwed right you're down

205
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,520
now no one cares and %uh so you can get
caught

206
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,480
we can't get caught as long as you don't
want to get caught om

207
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,490
and no actual physical violence there's
there's a guy on our team who

208
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,940
really wants to like cut off people's
hands and use that as leverage like male

209
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,910
threats to people so arm that's
typically out of school

210
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,340
I think you know who you are

211
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,880
so let's let's go on a step step 1:

212
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,690
week on its always be con-

213
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,560
you not operate one right for supplying
a target

214
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,390
become so you to find out what the
attack surfaces

215
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,970
and normally people just go to Google on
start the economy go to Knotts you guys

216
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,520
are very hard but there's a lot of
things

217
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,980
other things you can do you write you
can't call you can you re coming like a

218
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,550
when you call her missus the phone

219
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,460
that's important information on you can
stop by five day visit

220
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm supposed to be replacing every word
for with five such you

221
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,290
in about a sign saying Iran go ahead and
hung out take a break and a drink

222
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,830
on that up but I don't you can stop I
and

223
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,040
just walk and a lot of places let's hear
it and check things out

224
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,150
you get a lot more information than you
from this external view

225
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,610
and of course 06 right so

226
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,580
weird to be approaches start making a
docket on

227
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,600
on every single person you can find a
pickup find them on LinkedIn through the

228
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,140
company

229
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,150
and then every social media that they
have facts about that where they went to

230
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,050
school

231
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,170
%uh things like that you'll find really
interesting things

232
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,980
our company basically

233
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,940
basically bill

234
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,490
no babies like little group a people
that you're like I'm sure these guys are

235
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,390
friends cuz they

236
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,660
all played football together at a
college and I

237
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,930
and Paula these guys used to be from
this other

238
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,450
pounds so maybe they on the weekend so
you can kind of get an idea

239
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,780
who works there with the environment
it's like especially for small offers

240
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,580
so let me any profit since setback for a
second %uh

241
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,980
most other ads he work I'm doing right
now is on small companies

242
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,120
startups and then you know silicon
valley-based

243
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,510
on in San Francisco so if you like on
this applies to this think that I'm

244
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,660
talking about at

245
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,560
you know Pittsburgh a car from and its
its different out there

246
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,930
agree but you can still apply the same
techniques

247
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,640
minutes one other big things is to
identify moments

248
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,210
opportunity so this is like the
company's having a Benz

249
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,460
and the host about it publicly that
Syrian

250
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,400
at a ban everyone knows about everyone
expects it and if you can leverage that

251
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,300
event you can

252
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,670
either show up physically or use it as
an efficient campaign

253
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,410
but using like events that are happening
he comes very very powerful

254
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,620
and a lot of times they kinda sucks if
you engage ment scope

255
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,690
his in a period where the companies are
really doing anything

256
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,330
because now I have to get market I'm
other things like

257
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,180
acquisitions press announcements things
like that ways to find out about his

258
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,640
offense

259
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,310
so it's cool to your target

260
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,110
you know what kinda fireman they have
hopefully and I need some our

261
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,420
so tell you about the last hour that I
had to

262
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,460
make when I draw my own that some
requirements for adequate in

263
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,670
I could have my mouth where on the
system communicating

264
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:02,640
here tax and only targets were OSX or
Linux and so basically I had to

265
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,089
come up with something encrypt it and
there's no like HTTPS reverse

266
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:07,589
interpreter shopper OSX

267
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:11,650
and a for some reason didn't really feel
like writing one because I'm like what's

268
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,089
going on with her partner and then

269
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:17,050
I like we red team hacks are now part of
everything that's in every 80 signature

270
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,520
ever

271
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,620
so I didn't really want that om so I
mean something

272
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,720
simple I think samples good especially
purely zebra me

273
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,079
and i wanna I wanna couple a couple key
categories right I wanted intrepid

274
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:33,949
I wanted flexible commanding control I
wanted to be portable across at least

275
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:38,600
when nixon ice axe I initially intended
to be portable commoners to you but

276
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,120
the compatibility for that I doubt
typically on and I wanted only to troll

277
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,579
and we'll talk about that later so
here's what I came up with something

278
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:47,550
that looks a bit like this

279
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,329
I'll thus I caught my snail

280
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:55,240
our not really sure why but I so the
snout system here

281
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,589
yes to acquire yeah so this note system
here

282
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:02,269
where does purses calls up to Twitter
and it finds

283
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:06,209
a Twitter account and a decoder a tweet
that the bunch a random words

284
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:10,350
it then resolves an IP address and port
based on that and just

285
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,179
send servers SSH tunnel back out to a
server Amazon

286
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,480
I then %uh access it through a VPN

287
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
message in a server in 10 message
directly into the user's box

288
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,390
has to do a couple things under the hood
make this work like send a private and

289
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,280
public key pairs change permissions and

290
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,600
happened it's its pretty simple also
when I

291
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,669
when I was looking for a hacker clipart
I found this

292
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:38,159
on this is what happens look like so you
know so if you're not dressed like this

293
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:40,559
and I don't really see many that are

294
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,140
I you're doing it wrong I need to get a
hat and you get a trench coat

295
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,669
summers anyways so

296
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:52,650
this was my demo side and case like the
internet wasn't working

297
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:59,650
this is yes sir god damn

298
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,850
I did mean in five min

299
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,490
alright I'll try to be better so

300
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,220
I I think internet is working so its
gonna to a demo

301
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,850
just like on you

302
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,940
hearing

303
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,039
cool okay on Etsy

304
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,710
so have a Twitter account I registered
on the plane out here

305
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,179
go

306
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,159
on if you if you see here its once in
your life which that stands for five

307
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,909
actually had to change it because for
some reason I wanna mind holding your

308
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:52,539
genes that happens later on

309
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:55,869
I was choking on the 5 and by that I
mean the

310
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:59,450
ap bio are or oh you are

311
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,179
she's OK so anyways basically

312
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,330
I i put this tweet out here already and
here's how this Tweet generated

313
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,789
height alright hun har har har

314
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:17,600
a on sec yeah I can see the screen sees

315
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,070
you

316
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:27,279
while day

317
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,619
are

318
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:35,639
to help that resolution on so here's
this Twitter account

319
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:38,690
Derby Conn is the best for once in your
life

320
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,429
and up here's how this tweet was
generated

321
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:48,540
so I

322
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,360
kept of

323
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,350
in

324
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:07,080
commuters would bite me

325
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:14,080
%uh actually a pretty with the script
does

326
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:22,130
i'd never said it

327
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,650
on in this recisions

328
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:34,590
yet still see this okay you

329
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:40,840
okay so I have this encoder skip and as
a couple hard coded values

330
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:47,840
but %ah basically this encoder skip
tate's its

331
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,170
but that's my backup script and his site
builder create one here

332
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:56,420
it takes I P a port and a lexicon file
and what this sucks con pile is any text

333
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,410
that I choose

334
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:03,900
that I then E the technology pockets
take out all non alphanumeric characters

335
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:09,100
and then should present down I use it as
an index to resolve the IP addresses

336
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,020
so the each other each word is a
reference into an octet

337
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,220
and then the last four words are like
the last five words

338
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,240
I'm not even tryin up here

339
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,900
the last five words %uh

340
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,130
are the port each digital the court hun
so

341
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:33,090
don't even talk about the pies in my IP
address

342
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:40,090
and I have no idea what this is going to
generate her

343
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,590
okay so I'm using two markers on the
front its up

344
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,090
red team says and at the end it's or
something i dk

345
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,429
so basically these are things that are
going to occur on a Twitter page

346
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:56,200
%uh at first I was parsing through in
finding the tags on

347
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,309
and I'll ask to plug a week before they
changed it somehow on everything broke

348
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:02,590
sums like screw that I'll use my own

349
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,909
hot start and the letters so

350
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:10,370
this is what I would three red team says
provide people Pelican pilot continue

351
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,169
your configuration into you

352
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:15,980
are something I don't know on that's
pretty similarly I'd

353
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,630
things different as the part number so
I'm not going to waste time it reading

354
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,270
it but you get what happens the Twitter
account

355
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:26,549
now I have another script here carbs

356
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:30,120
male maker and this is a your house

357
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,220
year this is a script that writes his
scripts which is

358
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:41,220
rigidity

359
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,409
so

360
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:50,309
if you ever written a script that writes
his scripts any such a coating

361
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:54,890
like me %uh it's gonna look something
like this: which is the bitches

362
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,309
superfund to debug

363
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:02,740
I found a bug in it like dinner
yesterday quest great I didn't say

364
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,340
anything

365
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,860
so anyways it basically yes take so much

366
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,020
arguments takes on a budget things that
I think might be useful and generate the

367
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,830
papon step another couple automated
thing

368
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:20,830
mobile Walker but it looks like this is
pretty ridiculous five leaves

369
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:25,960
tenser

370
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,900
sis the for okay so the first thing you
ask me for is the lexicon and I'd call

371
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,570
it lacks

372
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:37,190
and the next 30 you guys wanna pick an
XR ke something short bees

373
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,680
5 got it architects are key is five

374
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,340
up should have picked you shoulda picked
five

375
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,760
and and the user name

376
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,300
this is the username that I'm going to
be on establishing an SSH tunnel back up

377
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:52,960
to you

378
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,340
you know yes and the user doesn't
actually have a shell so if you try and

379
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,700
log in with the private key that's going
to be everywhere

380
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,710
you shouldn't get a shell hopefully I am
manana

381
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,800
just ought to at least laziness now

382
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,410
and the Twitter handle is

383
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:18,410
boat once in you're like said resolve it

384
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,020
the job so that he needed

385
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,130
identifiers are red team says or
something i DK

386
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:34,000
correct me if I am if I'm missing out
because you guys there smart

387
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,050
and then I have a option to enable OSX
persistence

388
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,050
so basically this technique what it does
is it put something in the library

389
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,210
launch regions up the US border and uses
lost control

390
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,690
to say Katie this is a you like
persistent service that needs to stay on

391
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,580
all the times

392
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,580
does not require root or anything you
and this will happen is

393
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,930
if someone sees the process the script
running

394
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,450
and they kill it operating system like
ok on my couch and started back up again

395
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,390
and so you can tell you unload this this
model so

396
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:12,760
I mean enable that also and they're not
need a

397
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,620
a label idea on Sky News the 5.0 once

398
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,470
and I have a key configured already man
asked me if I'd like to obviously

399
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,610
variable and so I'll show you what this
doesn't second seller

400
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,600
hoping this doesn't crash the sometimes
the parsing

401
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,310
crashes on this so that's why that other
step is already there that

402
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:41,580
networks or pork or pork or

403
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,100
this takes a second

404
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:54,100
mistakes you like

405
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,789
it's a good sign okay so here's the
first version of the script tickets

406
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:08,789
generated

407
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:13,309
looks like this

408
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:17,940
now if you see others crazy stop what
I'm doing is amusing that X or key

409
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,950
to II be 60 for the lexicon

410
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:26,179
and then I index into it to get letters
that I needed

411
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:29,730
and this basic sequestering is encoded
with the XRT

412
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,529
now it's not super great security my
script but it does prevent people who

413
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:37,320
have no idea of what they're doing 30
even running at are trying dynamic

414
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,850
analysis on it because you can't just
run in either by the X thirty other

415
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,750
words crashes

416
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,350
and then I didn't want people to just
read the source code or deodorant

417
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,820
strings on it and get all the stuff out
so

418
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,259
every variable that i think is important
for every string

419
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:56,049
then i think is important is basically
encoded using indexes and it sucks a

420
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:56,409
cock

421
00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:00,639
super low tech super chain he trap but
not you know I'm

422
00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:05,830
it work well in a so yet

423
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,019
now the encoding your teenage talk about
shares here's what that change is too so

424
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,990
if you read despite on skype right now

425
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,679
it's so pretty obvious what's happening
including urging does this

426
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,830
although there is no names now look like
this:

427
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,990
little more confusing however that's not
good enough

428
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,960
so there's a second anchored energy in
which does this

429
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,269
I need to open this and something else
the sublime a train cars &

430
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:39,309
fail miserably so the last version looks
like this basically a giant lambda

431
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:42,730
base64 encoded strings that unpacked

432
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,549
Hana ready to drink or I'll

433
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:52,590
going to drink 5 p60 part

434
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,090
I'm unknown time I saw her so it's

435
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:03,090
century has been see that on

436
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:20,360
was my answer key

437
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,500
five great call hoping this works

438
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,340
the user we'll never see this has

439
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm not gonna make them run papon on
their system talk about that later

440
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,770
see this one generated images me not so
nice out but so I can remember what all

441
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,210
those

442
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,420
things but I configured and I should
have a shell here

443
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:45,250
cool looks like it's working so far
tempting the democrats really hard

444
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,340
using the Internet okay

445
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:55,340
to a yes

446
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,940
right okay Monson

447
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:07,190
p.m. snapshots how do they work

448
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,080
home

449
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,660
well

450
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,780
only works on a white I'll we gotta move
on

451
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,250
but that does work because I use it
every day

452
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,920
bears up alright

453
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:30,390
so or assuming this report and you
didn't tell for some random reason

454
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,540
I you can be like I got in so

455
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,890

460
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,820
internal knowledge about car problem

461
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,880
they might have outside use this after a
hearty

462
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,179
internal to a network to use an IT guy

the people the social re common done and

466
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,850
basically see if they're interacting
with people on Twitter and see if

467
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:20,860

468
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,240

portfolio height

475
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,730
port come on you're stretching it

476
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,130
on so what I just use recently

477
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,130
was a hey I I'm on design blog

478
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:59,690
and your offices are beautiful and we'd
like to comment an interview

479
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,540
so our country Welsh up

480
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,970
or hate on your friend I'm registering a

481
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:10,120
so I see what your name is and I know
you have your normal

482
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,630
internal company email but I registered
a gmail with your name

483
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,490
and then I get into Google hangout some
nice thing about Google Hangouts is

484
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,130
when you when you said it doesn't show
your email it shows your name so you

485
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,360
copied their picture from Google
Hangouts by guessing their name

486
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,270
when you add them as a friend you can
see exactly what pictures are using

487
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,809
easily recreate them in your hands they
just message people and

488
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,410
the first time if they have that setting
know if you like a so-and-so once the

489
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,270
contact you

490
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,000
and now be like oh yeah i know i at
course that's weird and you can talk to

491
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,380
them

492
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,610
so this works really affectively if you
can gauge

493
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:51,640
who you're talking to you and who they
sit next to you or work with

494
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,150
or things like that so I had someone
really on the hook but only talking

495
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,000
you're in school I was able to

496
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,920
share out things

497
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,960
with who will try and like a and

498
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,120
up for and they sent me the email about
why it didn't work

499
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,360
up but so what ended up happening

500
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,960
is here %uh what's up with me to run
this is not cool all sorry didn't see

hours later to 8 o'clock at night

502
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,370
and I all they're probably Hall there's
no chance that they're in the office

503
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:24,990
so I can message them very safely and
they won't think that it's this person

504
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,060
130

505
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,120
sinuses might be like just online

514
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,530
we call the person and

515
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,540
right-handed you don't verify something

516
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,500
he's he's run the star and i try to send

518
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,170
that assuring them directly up to do a
bride

519
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,580
by the way %uh cycle here's a Dropbox
link

520
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:27,340
arts and unlike around the time they're
cooking at night is this a security test

521
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,600
working like now hearts not a security
test

522
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,590
night okay they're always testing us how
he should have

523
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,130
stop

524
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,710
so I mean you're gonna get in because
because people want to trust you

525
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,690
think they want you there they're not
suspicious like us all the time they

526
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,760
wanna trust you want things were
slightly so

527
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,130
you're getting speeds up so after in we
do

528
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,850
normal kind or a walk but %uh

529
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:01,090
by the YouTube video to GIF is amazing I
couldn't find a gift of this and I made

530
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,040
one last night I was very happy that

531
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,350
I had this idea that might be a thing I
Q what it's like yes holy a website

532
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,840
thank you so her so once you're in

533
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,510
which one do you want a minute normalcy
you don't wanna be

534
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,610
really weird you're gonna drop insert
and thats 9

535
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:22,370
so effectiveness didn't some people as
an Asian

536
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,419
okay so here's a few ways you can you
can find out what people normally do you

537
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:27,540
want on their box right

538
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,790
bash history if it's a Linux box or a
sexbox

539
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,280
you can also see if they have an SSH
connections open

540
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,860
that would be inbound or outbound has
you also want to know if there's people

541
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,950
in the environment that are at a sitting
in the people

542
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,230
boxes guess what you wanna know that got
you want to be that guy technically

543
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:48,380
on you can also look at NoHo straight if
there's nothing happening right now

544
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,730
have people accepted RC is high places
that part sometimes

545
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,520
up a recent one that detection quite
enough news PPP's

546
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,260
on OSX he will have something to
clipboard he pays

547
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,720
here at the condo the clipboard you know
it doesn't cook was a lot

548
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,620
passwords great also W also last seen
his naked in a system other way to see

549
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,050
if I

550
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,800
admins are connecting an orifice service
account but as access all the boxes

551
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,960
across the organization

552
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,870
and then you know go to the grocery
store so there's a sequel to his

553
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,860
original video

554
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,240
this one's normal dialogue is it going
to the grocery store to see Toy

555
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,990
recommendable so your move laterally

556
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,180
her tickets are a good way there's a lot
to say about them I say nothing about

557
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,680
them

558
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,970
up more importantly to something we
discovered recently

559
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,730
message control master up basically it's
something that allows multiplexing

560
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:42,230
do SSH and everyone's a yeah it's great
you should enable this

561
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,180
you wanna why because if you're
connecting to a server and need to

562
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,750
connect in the same server again

563
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,860
like the SEP files or something like
that NESH action

564
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,070
you won't get proper password or to
doctor of

565
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,400
or anything so what happens is

566
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,660
I look at bash history I look at current
connections I type literally the same

567
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,470
command

568
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,760
and instead the two back there of its
post you there I get

569
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,440
shopping with no password or anything
thanks multiplexing

570
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,830
so and Sep

571
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:16,180
so Sep 5

572
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,650
from more spice up

573
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:25,070
Aki con already got this generally in
the land you know the people

574
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,880
you know Cana who's who and what's going
on in the network you do internally car

575
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,970
so once you get that first shell inside

576
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:36,830
your initial week on a 2007 peace can
start again

577
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:40,910
it has suddenly does this whole new
information sources better internal

578
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:46,820
up so to hear things like percept
network scanning

579
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,930
want to drop into the environment
parents can

580
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,810
I was in their hand there knows the
check right for everyone knows that

581
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:57,150
you know that's going to cop really fast
8

582
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,330
don't want to get caught sunset pocus
what the user has access to you

583
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:05,670
it stop and then check it out so one of
them is

584
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,100
internal wheaties rate you can access to
an internal wiki

585
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,000
all mine like everything it's like union
employees there

586
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,730
which really helps when you're trying to
pretend to be employees there

587
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:21,460
so the meeting goal is finding the who

588
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,110
associated with the what and targeting
that person said trying to target

589
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,850
network services inside the network

590
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,870
you're gonna find services are eating on
them and bring experts at as it is

591
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,910
any ideas in place which you know if
there is on

592
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,190
it has any ideas and place like you're
going to get picked up a really fast

593
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,280
but if you're doing normal stuff that
uses Norling to you and you learn about

594
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,050
the environment

595
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,900
first and then you learn about who has
access to the stuff that you want and

596
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,850
you target them

597
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,140
specifically the same when you got in in
the first place

598
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,970
you're gonna go undetected

599
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,510
how do we take stop right so moving on
her on Sep 5

600
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,150
and we're just gonna it was gonna take
so if you're on Linux

601
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:06,060
he loggers five great success so this is
a keylogger like

602
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,070
in the in the middle attend has and it
is the

603
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,530
kinkiest silliest you are ever there's a
there's a command called shoky

604
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,770
hun X that is echoes back how whatever

605
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,670
like character codes for either being
crass and as a pilot light has the

606
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,869
reference for what those evaluated %uh
so basically it only runs for 10 seconds

607
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:28,930
if there's no user input I want to run
all the time so I run small python

608
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,750
script keeps it running

609
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:34,920
takes on all the like header information
up the opposite the command

610
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,560
and then just keeps like he's doing that
and I have another papon's here by drop

611
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,130
down

612
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:44,150
and decoded he water output and I I
think this requires root but it's pretty

613
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,340
easy to get a month so

614
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,150
now here's here's the new thing that I
found that I'm

615
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,920
really really psyched about so on OSX
which if you wanna key log on OSX

616
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,420
anyone here read an OS X keylogger yeah

617
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,880
me neither anyone wanna know why it's
really top

618
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,099
because there's this assistive devices
settings which is

619
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:08,720
pretty much impossible to enable unless
you're in colonel and already

620
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,890
meaning you already have a real and the
ability to do that there

621
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:16,470
and you need the user interaction
through the UI

622
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,520
to enable he this advice is I haven't
gone away

623
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,240
hurt make it happen anyway house so

624
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,140
member hola what's the easiest way to
get someones password

625
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,440
what's the easiest way to get someones
password

626
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,960
right so this is what we're doing this
also skipped is an apple scripting

627
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,540
languages build an and allows you to
tell

628
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,000
any application no no root required by
the way Patel

629
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,460
any application despite any dialogue
with any

630
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,470
heal but you want that says anything so
you type in this command and

631
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,380
this is what you can't

632
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,300
the had right

633
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,240
and it just the thus System Preferences
updating and actually i think im just on

634
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,609
a thing that allows you to cause that to
come to the fore ground but I have

635
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,170
included

636
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:08,150
yet has knows about works and Marty 0
for 1 on demos

637
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:13,170
it comes to the five brown

638
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,200
or 0 and then when someone types and
their password

639
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,130
tickets echoed right back to the show
but you have so

640
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,440
him with mine our make servers a stage
action you have

641
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,700
that uses access privilege use it to ask
them for their own password

642
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,550
and the Hebrew and then you know you
take their you take the keychain eating

643
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,059
the cookies and you kept everything and
have access to more

644
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:39,569
and say they have like 1password /url
ask pat or some other cheer you know

645
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:43,690
good sheep at some password manager
that's a different password

646
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,859
grain you can make the haps ask them for
their password

647
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:51,670
in home right should me

648
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:58,670
okay so I have a democrat still

649
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:02,339
and you see our already but I wrote a
small script you up

650
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:06,290
to make it easier on my cell think also
on the plane here

651
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:12,470
this is the 510 lisker

652
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:17,960
so basically I can define an application

653
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,069
if I know what the application name is
Lisa System Preferences system

654
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:23,319
preferences and quotas

655
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,270
on it seems to be the name %uh you like
ap container folder that sits in

656
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,210
applications

657
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,980
order and you're able to call it by that
name so I just automated it so

658
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,819
since I'm using a Mac and I'm targeting
Macs a lot I can use like things on my

659
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:37,690
own system to

660
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:41,720
to generate something really quickly
sums gonna pick a local application

661
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,900
how many as I pick

662
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,780
fire box he passed okay

663
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,740
I have did you guys wanna

664
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:00,570
specify anything particular give me your

665
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:07,540
password five great success cool

666
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,910
on so I added something in a script that
already makes it %uh in the clipboard

667
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,070
using he talkin

668
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,320
Agnes a sedan bookkeeper has launched

669
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,800
he passes jumping up and down on my
system tray

670
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,460
allCare 0 me or perhaps with her

671
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:30,460
short great and here we go

672
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,780
password things so it's pretty effective

673
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:42,780
pretty easy okay

674
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:46,400
so step 5: Yolo swag

675
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,060
so in the course love engagement

676
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:54,150
there's gonna be a chance where these
easy movements stopped working

677
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,080
so you have to actually pull out all the
stops so

678
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,900
in one instance with a hardened target
need to step up our game

679
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,849
right so run Linux boxes and or screen
shotting

680
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:09,450
people system so here's a here's
something that took me awhile to figure

681
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,260
out which

682
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,970
simple so it shouldn't have but if
you're message connection

683
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,280
and your screenshot the user screen you
need to add display equals

684
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,859
Holland 0 at the planet and then you can
import which is a screenshot utility

685
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:25,400
grab a screenshot abusers system now

686
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,670
I was really smart person was like you
know what my Mac mater

687
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,730
noise when ice next spring may be linked
to the same

688
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:39,369
so look it up Mike yes totally the way
pilots I go on I rename it on that

689
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:39,839
system

690
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,800
yes great but then I moved about 10
other systems and doing the same thing

691
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,619
and I don't remember to do it on a
single other system

692
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,000
haha

693
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,849
everyone's hearing the screenshots
you're listening to music and effects

694
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:55,000
stitched like all day

695
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,559
should top and then on the same usurp

696
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:03,819
seeing all their traffic through NAWS
server so that we can grab stop hope we

697
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:06,740
get for two-factor authentication code
like going to the secure environment

698
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:11,609
%uh and we're rebooting crawling killing
processes so the applications like the

699
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:12,740
settings of I and its

700
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,180
you know it the user like we started
this first guy

701
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:23,230
and sick he seems okay with it like he's
like yeah I calmly booted whatever like

702
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:26,520
its fine like things are slower than
normal but I can still get work done

703
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,900
great ho

704
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,359
up we're really daring

705
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,599
I we see this guy is he's RDP into
another computer

706
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,319
are like you know what he probably had
sickened dollars process is crashing an

707
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,980
ER DVD into his other computer so that
he could use the software on their

708
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:51,770
has Windows is better minutes that's
what he thought so he got

709
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:55,020
I didn't say that just five get I ever
said that so

710
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,559
we can do is we keep Greece his RTP
process

711
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,069
and then since he already had his creds
are you key to insist on so on his

712
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:03,490
desktop nothing's happening

713
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,940
says rose and he goes to try and use it
and

714
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,299
then we have RDP access and we have no
shells that when you're right we have

715
00:45:10,299 --> 00:45:11,970
whatever whatever he was doing

716
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:15,130
%uh still doing this stop

717
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,900
pretty treat injured hits rate
eventually

718
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,849
you're gonna forget to do everything in
Unicode so

719
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:26,250
happens when you get caught now now

720
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,280
this posting it hot you should get
caught eventually I'll talk about that

721
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:29,819
mark but

722
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:33,809
what happens when you get hot so they
get think it's suspicious

723
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:37,990
right they concede he was sitting in a
system that such great cetera

724
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,579
so what happens is users will send
emails and security

725
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:46,220
okay yo screenshots on a computer I'm
mad about this

726
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:51,069
however if you have their pass already
have access of other stop you can help

727
00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:52,390
them

728
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,840
you can be like actually everything's
fine

729
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,150
miss the week that you said that he now
so you're following up a secure Unni

730
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,030
Kevin school

731
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:04,100
end up you can also like organizer in
box a little bit and filter out any

732
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,780
further messages from security

733
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:10,020
stuff

734
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,930
but eventually are not going to be able
to use for everyone's you are going to

735
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:14,480
get caught

736
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,920
and so coming back to talking about

737
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,860
routine and red team it's important to
get caught on gays

738
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,860
because if you don't get caught then you
never know what it would be like

739
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,880
if your routine on someone and they
don't get to play too and then it's

740
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,040
boring for everybody right

741
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,980
the transmitter so week on mean you
should get caught

742
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,630
if you like well we still through the
hallway matter no one caught us we got

743
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,240
everything

744
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,580
cool engagements over make some noise

745
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,990
see if you get caught because if you
made a lot of noise and you didn't get

746
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:47,440
caught

747
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,050
that's a finding that something that you
need to let them know about hey like

748
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,280
not only did he goes to your network and
steal everything but then we

749
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,250
and not scan everything we're and Nick
delegates every web server that you have

750
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,520
and we started to ring medically models
and we

751
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,670
shell people with mister porter on
coated and no one side

752
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,840
like thats that's a finding they should
know about that

753
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,920
hopefully you will get caught and you
know this threshold and when you when

754
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,220
you find a special something magical
happens

755
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,980
because invasion kids way in part by
name erupt role ability

756
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,500
this is where it comes in the place so
you're hot

757
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,700
time ago random see if you can survive

758
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,780
there is a response hope you had a
response

759
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:33,810
and it you can survive it that's a fine
into something like to know about

760
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,880
and yet the piper football it's fun yep

761
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,070
so talking about reliability

762
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:44,620
what's coming to happen is they'll get a
holding an hour

763
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:49,290
and all start blocking your c2 well
thats fine using Twitter to resolve my

764
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,790
CT so I can change it so the first time
i block it changes so

765
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,830
if they look hey there's a SSH
connection now as bad

766
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:57,990
block great you treat

767
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,990
you teach you Amazon Elastic AP I'm it
for two seconds

768
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,080
I bought that one I want to annex 1

769
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:10,550
and I think it's smart and read a script
block everything see where the problem

770
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:11,160
here

771
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,780
mine easy to use Google NXT to his
Twitter

772
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:18,730
and Facebook any your website and every
Web site that you go to all the time are

773
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,140
you blocking is automatically

774
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:27,140
hoops yeah so if you manage to survive

775
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,900
the next step Sep 5 course is to rampage

776
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,690
right everything during the contest that
you didn't you because you thought you

777
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,400
would get caught

778
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,410
it's time to do it right see if you can
get all that exercise

779
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:42,610
see if they catch you eventually and
then and then close up and that should

780
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:43,550
be in at Yankee

781
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:48,330
I was on a sex site /url

782
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:54,000
thats home

783
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,010
so are Sep 12 I mean pipe

784
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:00,869
%uh is to drink and drank right if
you're doing this internally

785
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:05,330
this is especially important right the
blue team

786
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:08,380
the ones we've been talking all the time
those guys are Matt

787
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,080
right because you controlling them
you've been making their lives miserable

788
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,940
they've been working later gotta take
them out he can offer drinks

789
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:20,040
you nice to them the PN role-playing
make things more secure

790
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,080
son about red versus blue it's not red
and blue mittens

791
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:30,080
good it

792
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,010
I'm not getting down on one knee

793
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:41,010
okay and that is the second worst thing
that has ever happened to me

794
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:58,089
bureaucrats ok

795
00:49:58,089 --> 00:50:02,060
final step 5 ani: questioner got back up
dropping

796
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:09,060
cop you have time still

797
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,510
does anyone have a question

798
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:19,400
up

799
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,609
Hugel I love you 5 ever

800
00:50:22,609 --> 00:50:27,150
and then just watch the video cuz I
China explain it

801
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:34,150
you're going to be certain that I need
to wear home it all the time

802
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,580
so in my last minute

803
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,990
I'm a try for a demo that I steps but

804
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:45,700
there I told you about making jar files
so I wrote another script basically

805
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,000
takes my

806
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,390
payload and gives me a jar dropper

807
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:55,290
doesn't really matter

808
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:59,140
right so

809
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,670
it allows me to provide any arguments I
need and I think for this one it's a

810
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,630
load on subjects or encryption key

811
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,480
don't laugh grow up people come on

812
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,650
the stuff and then the output jar file

813
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:15,400
om I'm not gonna try and explain why
it's called Alexis but I'm gonna Colin

814
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,050
a la danse and then Tom or the
destination payloads I like the drops up

815
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:20,740
in part am

816
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,240
because that's what all the ET do and up

817
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,820
it other I just gonna drop it locally I
don't want it on their desktop

818
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,859
a man who can I run the payload

819
00:51:30,859 --> 00:51:34,250
and then any more commands can be run
select say

820
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,260
I'll o'donnell's in that will actually
make the

821
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:44,060
on OS X systems make it dislikes speech
to text than just sports up out

822
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:48,010
and then the option to delete the Paleo

823
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:51,210
after its running om I typically don't
do this

824
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,230
because I want my persistence to work
and more importantly

825
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:59,920
having the jar display a dialog message
tray like so I like to say I'm

826
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:06,920
Java version to resend or something like
that

827
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:13,579
that's a thing right so that I am lol
dong such are

828
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:20,579
and maybe I can get a demo sport when
you run this

829
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,720
and the show comes out hand I don't have
jobs their online

830
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:36,720
copyright the I

831
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:40,470
I think I reverted to a snapshot wades
you older so

832
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:45,079
okay up anyways talks over thank you for
coming if you have any questions up

833
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:50,630
any questions good ot know the dropper

834
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:54,470
will chopper papon us here in the bar
tab and uncheck it off

835
00:52:54,470 --> 00:53:00,769
other picked up looks like this really
simple this one needs to the office

836
00:53:00,769 --> 00:53:01,589
needed more

837
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:04,819
but it basically makes a new file of its
kind of ice

838
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:08,039
us makes it all rights out to it

839
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:11,279
and then you know kicks it off and then
displays a dialog message

840
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:14,789
and then you guys all there is an air
your thing didn't work this works if

841
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:15,640
they have Java

842
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,920
if they don't have Java though I which I
actually encountered

843
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,039
which you can do it especially for
carting away sacks

844
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,799
is making ap there's an app occupied a
place

845
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:30,460
that allow you to select the icon and
select ones gonna run it's like any

846
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,609
arguments to it which

847
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:35,349
meets all my needs so make an app and
then Tom

848
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:39,140
the app can display whatever but
basically it be downloaded from the

849
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,690
Internet of the right click and click

850
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,069
open if they have the default settings
right but if you put on a flash drive

851
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:47,749
and say you're already interviewing
someone for something okay it sorry

852
00:53:47,749 --> 00:53:52,099
I need you to sign this consent form
have a USB Drive here

853
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:56,390
boom a sign a consent form which is a
different format you cook this one first

854
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:03,270
him app runs go so they don't have jobs
that's that's the solution

855
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:07,900
other questions cool
