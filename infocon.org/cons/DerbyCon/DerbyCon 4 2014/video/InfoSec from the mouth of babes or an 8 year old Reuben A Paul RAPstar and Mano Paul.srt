55
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:37,009
addition to the other computer pony now

56
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:44,009
start with quite a few teach kids that
if a sec used to live in a world that

57
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:45,699
was physically you secure

58
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:50,310
with were so far bomb suggest a batboy
the geek really insecure

59
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,720
even more because somebody with a
backhander could trigger a bomb even

60
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,120
more deadly than the Fatboy

61
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,960

63
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:06,750
million to the haps which kids like me
injured kid he is

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,660

66
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,580
you should teach your kids can use it
carefully and securely another reason

67
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,660
why he can check into ninety percent he
took a school don't Egypt I think

68
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,310
schools don't teach it because

69
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,990
they're not aware portage could also be
because making that all hackers are bad

70
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,250
which is not necessarily true how many

71
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,250
you are back then change each to keep

72
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,090
that was so get how can you teach kids

76
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,470
hey nice little as after party a scooter

77
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,220
then I dance got me this other computer

78
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,490
me and let me which hopefully will be
nikesha car

79
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,430

82
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,680

little bit about busing

91
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:54,509
up and finally let me tell you about
what can teach teach a ban imposed

92
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:58,259
how do you have children that listen kid

another thing that you can another thing
that kids can teach you

104
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,400
