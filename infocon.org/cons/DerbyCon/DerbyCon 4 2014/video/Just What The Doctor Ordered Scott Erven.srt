1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,260
miners got irvin a done

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,919
the firm on OVA researchers on medical
device security Sean

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,110
American you're also help to me out on
significant amount of this

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,550
I researched them a show you on internet
facing medical devices

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,039
and director facing attack vectors and
threat modeling that we did so

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,240
visitor annals joining us up and get a
hold of us contact us or anything

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,560
so I think you'd ask and over

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,940
you know why researching medical device
security are you know what your intent

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,200
you know why you care about this you
know space ands

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,820
personally have been and you know
security and and I T for just over 15

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,320
years were spent over five years

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,780
specifically and I'm in healthcare
security so I've

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,289
I've been in the spacer very familiar
with it and it's really

14
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:54,660
to me it's kinda a patient safety issue
that I see I and i also

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,020
you know on appeal the present these
risks and also

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,090
solutions to you know defenders at
various healthcare organizations

17
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,229
on check with them onto you know protect
the state's devices there's no doubt

18
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,369
that all these devices you know save
countless lives

19
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:13,330
they do with their intended to do but
this kind of some unintended

20
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,580
consequences for not building security
and

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,240
now that we need to be aware than and
get better at and ultimately

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,729
night in the end you know any

23
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,759
organization ever worth floors security
professional

24
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,470
not yet AFL that okay I could

25
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,610
you know contribute in protect the
organization hopefully in his little

26
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,579
girl reading but

27
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:39,400
I was struggle to find out how can I A
you know directly contributor affect

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,880
organizations you know missions are
values those types of things

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,659
and when I started to look at medical
devices that's what I really realized I

30
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,619
can make a direct impact on that

31
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,270
you know locating vulnerabilities in iOS
devices working with the manufacture to

32
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,780
get the resolve and get them fixed

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,360
as really rewarding and that's when you
aren't going to look at this stuff

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,649
as a security person and release a

35
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:03,799
you know I think you know I contributed
to patient safety and pretty much

36
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,540
in health care organization on if you
who works for health care in here

37
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,599
good sewer I assume

38
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,989
loss on say something about patient
safety or quality care otherwise use

39
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,849
Priceline organization or for

40
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:20,989
when so also the there's a lot of folks
have kinda been

41
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:24,560
misinformed right oppositions public
just everybody this is a

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,069
excerpt that i've for the FBI %uh was a
private industry notice but know that

43
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,920
within weaker to these private industry
houses and up on the internet so I'm not

44
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,340
sure if anything should be sharing

45
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,290
but so the biggest the vulnerability was
a perception allied health care

46
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,390
professionals believes that the current
printer defense and compliance

47
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,750
strategies were working

48
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,000
when clearly the data states otherwise
says pretty powerful

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,660
to come from the federal agency to say
this is an issue you guys need to wake

50
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,060
up

51
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,230
you're behind the other thing a you're
familiar some research

52
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,760
they did back early in the year

53
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,959
looking for a March when I looked at
specific devices

54
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,379
dollar comments on the media articles

55
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,830
that's from the positions and Nate and
even from

56
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,260
security professionals inside health
care organization and they said

57
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,989
we understand that his research on the
devices but

58
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,849
we guarantee you there's segment of two
and we guarantee they're behind

59
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:19,659
firewalls

60
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,780
and I put my PhD credential online for
that so

61
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,049
hopefully yes you know that guy back
Antone said Street Spears detail but

62
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:28,330
after she heard

63
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,599
for look in my presentation but anyways
I mean

64
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,019
it's definitely kind of why we want to
look at the internet facing starts to

65
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:35,379
give

66
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:39,310
you know the public to give people
awareness into you know what is the risk

67
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,569
can these be accessed home I know
personally that segmentation is becoming

68
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:47,909
less and less likely inside a health
care organization because we're having

69
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:49,209
it at these devices

70
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,060
on into the medical record and share all
this data in real time

71
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,930
minorities you that got open up to
become a flat network signee there's a

72
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,890
reality was there

73
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,099
but people still think and that goes
what the FBI saying that sir

74
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,159
the perception is a little bit different
the reality

75
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,870
this is can interesting Sean Thomas for
my hobby room in

76
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,330
and he said I've never seen industry
with more gaping holes for financial

77
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,689
industry our security the healthcare
sector does

78
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:19,530
out stuff like ass in a mattress on my
bed so they can I goes

79
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,630
you know to show when we continue in the
financial industry series after reach

80
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,600
common ask an opinion of you know how
far even behind financial retail

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,100
that we are Indian culture so also just
curious

82
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,820
and ID on this disclosure process for
you know what's in the soccer today

83
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,800
i'd is back in April we set out the
source and the findings

84
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,100
on had a call with GHS nice yes sir

85
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,310
and the NMA or something additional
disclosures on summer difficult leader

86
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,530
stuff that I'll talk about

87
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,500
on anything where I mention I'm
healthcare awards

88
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,100
authenticated access those types of
things it will also provide ongoing

89
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,350
assistance to various you know federal
agencies health care Arts manufactures

90
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,949
so so my drawing is your address today

91
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,780
I am most ok water shown you

92
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,130
is actually threat modeling their our
attack vectors our show you and the

93
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,080
vulnerabilities

94
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,590
the

95
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,740
her body this is I'm gay I for sure got
some technical difficulties

96
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,900
at media seized up again and we only any
live video audio

97
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,009
you out up this likes to continue if you
check

98
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:34,770
and later on you'll see that autostart
up forget about the 17-minute mark

99
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,770
siphoning minutes

100
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,750
are seeking to seize new saw for eight
years and replay

101
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,750
a attacks against these devices I miss
close trust

102
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,880
cracks in the attacks were you can
changed figures value so you can change

103
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,189
upper and lower sensing limits are when
these I'd

104
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:32,490
you know implantable defibrillators
actually sense they're going into

105
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,130
cardiac arrest initiate you can also
change so I

106
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,040
now she like jewel values which which
changed the

107
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,100
the limit love how many jewels to
deliver

108
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,540
when this actually begins to you know
into shock second one here this

109
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,150
Pediatrics nuclear med

110
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,720
imaging system and the bottom one this
is this is interesting to see anesthesia

111
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,320
workroom sinuses or chrome

112
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,090
probably not actually you know
associated to a medical device or

113
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,060
anything like that it could very well
just be

114
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,210
a nurse's station that happens to be an
anesthesiologist or something like that

115
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,500
but the top one here's a little bit more
interesting because I was as anesthesia

116
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,130
locks if you know anything about the arm
Ironman

117
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,720
again is very sterile is very control
they're not going to have excessive

118
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,770
items in the o.r so this is pretty much
certainly

119
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,810
and anesthesia card workstation inside
the o.r

120
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,620
that as an attacker I know specifically
where to go to hit that

121
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,920
anesthesia card inside the or now
alright so

122
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,800
you found one organization lead happen
have 12,000 employees and some 70,000

123
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,780
stones

124
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,850
com ands you showed me in Canada

125
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,690
you know showed us some examples trade
have some these devices so

126
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,110
not only did we find thousands of
healthcare organizations with this

127
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,870
issue and this is just a specific one
but it also wasn't just a couple devices

128
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,690
so we took all the data and we use our
favorite data analytics software called

129
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,710
I excel

130
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,050
and we'd we don't in there and basically
all we did was a

131
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,760
you know search fines for for various
keywords and and to take the data can

132
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,000
you identify self

133
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,950
rigid also inside I'm just this one
organization are thousands we found

134
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,050
thousands over medical devices and
scoring system so

135
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,770
he's kinda his sorry we found inside
that one organization so

136
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,070
from 21 systems associated
anesthesiology 488

137
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,140
Associated cardiologists pacemaker stuff
like that r33

138
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,920
associated to infusion systems on fusion
constructs types of things

139
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,020
on the backend systems that communicate
with the infusion pumps

140
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,210
MRI devices just under 100 sore 300 pack
systems

141
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,390
access does again like I said that's
where your image in a store so

142
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,800
right now I think this is probably the
I'll

143
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,100
one of the biggest ways go even probably
more so than the actual medical record

144
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,230
where we're getting financial a.m.

145
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,390
you know gain from the hackers you know
breaking in

146
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,970
and stealing medical identities because
all the pack systems that

147
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,630
I've done well they have authentication
and those types of things

148
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,260
pretty much locked down inside of the
application everyone

149
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,700
%uh the back in store systems that they
supply the communicates with it

150
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,090
all but one of them that I've assessed

151
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,210
doesn't have a passer on the backend
storage

152
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,810
or the hardcoded service account so once
you log into the application

153
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,110
than it actually does the crew your
heart pulitzers count or

154
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,730
doesn't think so authentication Aussie
can't just dump the entire share

155
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,270
area radiology images and gravel that
patient information so I think that's

156
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,360
probably how

157
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,690
blah the medical identity theft is is is
coming out

158
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:40,460
67 movement systems and ultimately 31
systems

159
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,060
associates who pacemaker technology a
pacemaker controllers

160
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,770
summer some attacks rate so we've got a
few

161
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,140
so was over the physical attack we've

162
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,530
we now know what systems are there we
know the medical devices

163
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,570
that their associated to inside the
organization we also know

164
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,030
the specific health care organization
and we know

165
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,960
location to go to you in all a lot of
these examples we have the floor and we

166
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,640
have the office number listed there

167
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,770
we know the position so we know their
practice and

168
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,550
Wilson of it as a locker exemption so
you walk into that facility

169
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,970
we can go to the second floor office 101
doctor johnson we know they radiologist

170
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,040
learner probably

171
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,679
have read are reading workstation
collectivity these backend systems

172
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,650
and we know has a lockout exemption so I
just very tired as a physical attack

173
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,560
walk in there

174
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,740
sits on a system I can also then just go
directly at the medical devices I'm

175
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,669
interested in

176
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:40,419
not noisy phishing attack so the similar

177
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:44,990
we have the same type information down
we know the host name all the devices

178
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,190
and what their associated with

179
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,140
so intentionally all you need to do now
is this create a custom payload to

180
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,650
execute so instead I love

181
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,429
up your planting to that system and then
going out and scanning and being noisy

182
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:57,640
on the entire environment

183
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,700
we could be very strategic an attack
right so attacker could now go in and

184
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,650
say oh I just wanna go after these

185
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,510
you know specific host names cuz their
associates this the CT scanners the

186
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,700
pacemaker controllers

187
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,780
I don't need a mess with the noise I'm
going after anything else anymore

188
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:18,200
solo 70,000 systems I'm only gonna buy
36

189
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,550
7 attack as well as a direct attack
vector that we found and this is where

190
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,650
do you know them sooo 67 is there

191
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:29,270
Noda and miso is 67 this happens to be
you know remote code execution

192
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,500
and also happens run the ball SMB for

193
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,740
so we know SMB is open on this back in
that were completely known as anonymous

194
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,890
read for Active Directory

195
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,140
is pulling an all information for Active
Directory infrastructure

196
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,360
we're going to play that and then we can
have it and we can create custom tailors

197
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,179
to directly

198
00:22:46,179 --> 00:22:49,169
you know scanned and attacked the entire
medical devices and systems are

199
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,140
interested in

200
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,260
sa good now is a positive news for tumor

201
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,230
world's gone and stuff home and please
no like i said i mean that there's

202
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,679
definite risks here

203
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,130
but the to the bottom line in that you
know they save a life so

204
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,540
scorn understand that too but they're
this with this was a really big win on

205
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,070
this

206
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:15,540
SMB stuff so we disclose it on
coordinate that with DHS nice yes sir

207
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,770
and we actually had the health care
organization has been using the example

208
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,800
here

209
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,429
their series backup home and

210
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:28,929
you know the they were actually willing
and they share with me and I won't share

211
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,950
with you this confidential but

212
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,090
you know the stepped-up I mean they
handle it very much early

213
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,770
which this is the first time that I see
a certain has handled

214
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,440
coordination between a security
researcher an actual health care

215
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,440
organization third-party so ice yes sir
has

216
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,480
you know been working with us and
handled lots of cases where

217
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,429
we've reported disclosures to medical
device manufacturers but this is the

218
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:53,370
first time

219
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,450
the did wordsworth a security researcher
at National Health Organization so

220
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:01,230
it was very positive the sure the and
the full as a response document is it

221
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,440
was a very thorough

222
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,220
they actually cut things that United
indicate on what types of attacks but

223
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,340
because I wasn't

224
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,669
a national attacker and I was ordering
open source tools

225
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:14,610
you know some other stuff %uh the fuck
you know found I had reported but they

226
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,770
were able to confirm

227
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,720
answers very thorough on you know is
very positive I think

228
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,850
experience for everyone obviously is a
little uncomfortable

229
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,179
in any situation when you're you know
reporting issues but I

230
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:29,650
zephenia positive and no new steps in

231
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,400
new things when we're dealing with this
coordinated disclosure size happy with

232
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,160
that

233
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,919
so you know the SMB thinks are they
directly on the Internet

234
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,650
so should you how we could give it get
into these organizations and get to them

235
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,470
over the internet but are they didn't
directly on the public Internet

236
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,770
yeah they are arm it's not as gloom and
doom

237
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,950
as you would think it is limited others
two reasons for that one

238
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,840
you don't have access like these things
are custom their proprietary so you

239
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,590
don't have access to

240
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,050
you know banners are things like that
the Ukrainian showed an are also their

241
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,880
customers persuaded run some customized
for stuff like I said were shown and

242
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,440
find some stuff

243
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,490
home but it's not you know hundreds of
thousands of devices just

244
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,030
just sitting out there many cases the
utilize public cellular carrier networks

245
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,230
initially example here are some on to be
leaders

246
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,470
confirms all

247
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,990
so are we find this just a brief
argument show you a little bit on like

248
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,270
to use Apple's just for time sake but

249
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,800
we did find defibrillators external
defibrillators sitting

250
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,550
on the public Internet we also found
feeling for monitoring systems directly

251
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,470
on internet

252
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,240
but home-based EG systems and we found a
lot of vaccinating systems which I said

253
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,850
before

254
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,440
very weak backend infrastructure on
there sitting directly

255
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,300
internet facing so whilst we find you're
looking at the center of a swell

256
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,580
without health care systems completely
honest indicated as drivers into their

257
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,100
entire network

258
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,880
fun device manufacturer structure there
was anonymous FTP czar states that

259
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,130
things are happy to date on all that in
there

260
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,630
and third-party contract organizations
for his health care institutions

261
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,870
that had things like FTP service with
anonymous you know things open that had

262
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,550
confidential take data inside them

263
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,100
so Sean actually did this when we found
this initially in 2012

264
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,270
as on fetal monitors and and document
name manufacturer on this

265
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:25,090
because I done this I don't think it's a
manufacturer problem pollen find too

266
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,159
many shows clearly

267
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,620
in there was no indication there
documentation that they recommended

268
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,820
being on the public Internet they
clearly recommended

269
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,740
otherwise so it's not a specific
manufacture problem although shine

270
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,580
did work with the manufacture to to
reach out to someone else customers

271
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,290
but disclose in 2012 we're re disclose
interrupted him eighteen

272
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:49,179
so this is a quick shot and map by just
28 they were left out there

273
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:53,730
when we happen to check it they were
still searching on public IP space

274
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,350
and or apple on still had 2003 server I
A six

275
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,950
funny upon their abilities to take those
systems over as well

276
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,020
their remote desktop or web access for
our support as well

277
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,100
and someone that had default to
credentials associated with it in

278
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,240
documentation

279
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,380
so we do this there is nothing I snag a
question like who's going who's gonna do

280
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,500
this well

281
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,720
there's a que serve okay your adversary
on teachers both you know

282
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,169
the only true well financially in and
agree with that to some extent

283
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:28,770
Ahmed right now those indicators that we
see

284
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,340
who who read about you know Chac chs
hack

285
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,510
me health for a half million to their
anyone in here they got anything

286
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:41,600
outer that other than four and a half
million official records being exposed

287
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,940
anybody what's up

288
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,000
like was there anything else that stood
out in your the

289
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,500
report certain thing other than just the
fact that four and a half million

290
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,880
patient records or stall stone

291
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,290
no

292
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:06,310
him the letters on that um but

293
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:11,440
to me so most people they read it now I
ask for national in patient records

294
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,679
I read it how much town sheriff respect
record three times this year

295
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,640
because it breaches so always
interesting to me when I caught onto in

296
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,130
that

297
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,380
on what got my attention was they
actually came out in the reports in the

298
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,169
FBI reports and they said

299
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:28,600
they're also specifically targeting
medical device information

300
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,710
and IP rights psychologist there right
away said you know anything

301
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,130
about midtech and then also his real you
know

302
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,230
traceback say like everything Chinese
you know

303
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,740
the BT Group arm but nonetheless if you
know anything about china and the

304
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,679
medtech industry is a huge push in China
right now

305
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,830
to develop medtech because they're
having to import everything

306
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,990
from other countries from europe in from
the US so there's a huge thing

307
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,390
so it doesn't line for intellectual
property stuff his attacks against his

308
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,550
health care organizations

309
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,590
and similar attacks in the last year
against medical device manufacturers

310
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,260
they're gonna

311
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,440
against intellectual property rights so
that may say oh well it's only about

312
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,310
financial gain

313
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:10,720
well don't think that's the case the
other one was

314
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,210
I got an email and I want the articles
it came out from some guy and I think he

315
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,639
said he probably a hundred emails back
and forth trying to tell me that

316
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:20,200
they all live in caves and they're never
gonna figure it out and you're telling

317
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,700
102

318
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,840
you know the network I'm completely
ignorant I think you were good at that

319
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,570
you know the Schlecks live in caves I'm
you some just completely

320
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,880
outrageous com but you know they're not
the only ones

321
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,880
and they are a little bit more
technically adept than than that

322
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,370
so we should we worry about United it I
think we have

323
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,659
you know tears extremist groups we get
more techno beat up for getting laces

324
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,370
cases

325
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,419
other states folks nations
state-sponsored attacks

326
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,060
that's we need to look at officials
themselves this this wasn't

327
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,830
awesome one so Sean found this and yes
the email me

328
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,080
and this is from Austria

329
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,810
the first two patients that were gunshot
wound victims

330
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,820
and so they were brought into to the ER

331
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,340
and they were given and hooked up to an
infusion pump with your finger

332
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,810
blows a PC a module so it's kinda self
control than it has

333
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,070
upper limit so that you only give so
much so often but it was a

334
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,700
self-controlled thing in

335
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,860
their toll on the day you know clinical
staff aide

336
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,110
it's not taking the pain away so what
did they decide to do

337
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:32,020
well they decided Hamburg on the
Internet

338
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,700
a look at the service documentation they
found serves documentation they found

339
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,490
the default hardcore credentials

340
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,610
they broke into the devices and change
the upper limits on their vision Ponce

341
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:46,179
couple days later Wonderland our sponsor
mets to develop like a TI

342
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:49,360
I on

343
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,590
you know the basically got used to you
you know all the ins all the medicine

344
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,780
working anymore

345
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,179
just gonna some I'd never thought about
before was the actual patient themselves

346
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:01,050
that was interesting this answer me that
article on a site com

347
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,679
scanner interesting you know story here
way to look at it too

348
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,940
that's not just you think a

349
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,980
combined sac is probably you know the
greatest risk

350
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,940
between at me financial value and the
financial attacks

351
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,130
is this kind in my opinion why we've
seen the FBI

352
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,230
get involved they released two advisers
in April the FBI has historically hasn't

353
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,020
had anything to do with putting on
advisers on medical devices been

354
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,990
you FDA and DHS ice yes sir when I FBI
is very

355
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,590
heavy you know into the space they're
very interested in it and I think it's

356
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,220
that

357
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,419
yunus financial crimes and then also
this you know combine attacked

358
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:42,950
model so ed actually spoke here home and
ed

359
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:48,360
runs saber City with Connor hack and
secular city has

360
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,850
all the critical infrastructure setup
right so it's got all the players in

361
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,460
there it's got the power plants got the
health care system

362
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,840
and another thing that input on the
slide but last week it came across an

363
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,580
article

364
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,409
that had commented on about to cynically
about cybersecurity

365
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:06,409
and adds comment was you know something
to the fact that

366
00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:10,000
we had to Hardin our health care
environment

367
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,080
in cyber city because it was just too
easy to hack if we did in

368
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,460
so I was kinda by you know a bold
statement there and

369
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,240
but bread and I think a realistic
statement as to you know how far

370
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,070
really behind I'm kinda man I open toe

371
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,820
so has an attack are you happen as the
seller thing I get is

372
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,179
r8 we have risk verses likelihood and I
think it's clear there to do a lot of

373
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:35,800
people say

374
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,550
well there's no dress in an attack
against a medical devices

375
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:42,840
but so we have to start further
discussing you know what that is the

376
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,380
rest

377
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,260
I think if you look at the risk there's
no doubt like I've shown that there are

378
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,120
significant risk there

379
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,300
and you can do bad things to the system
so that it becomes

380
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,139
you know what's the likelihood of that
actually happening

381
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:59,139
and then it comes down to has an attack
Rd happen

382
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:03,169
and I like to then look at it up well is
attack intentional

383
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:07,540
and targeted or unintentional and how do
we look at that going forward and how do

384
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,730
we get some that data

385
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,730
well we have a challenge right now close
or so but

386
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,880
you know closers code we have
specialized proprietary protocols on iOS

387
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,580
devices was very hard

388
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,840
the forensic capabilities on these
devices are lacking on their very

389
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,200
week and without that trail

390
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,050
you know how do we prove it whether
intentional or otherwise how can we go

391
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,179
back and look at it

392
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:34,580
so save us some research that's upcoming
year we're gonna start to look at

393
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,800
some of those ideas since the devices
themselves black that stuff but

394
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,880
I can tell you that attacks are already
happened I can tell you that

395
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,120
several hundred thousand is the words
from the FDA

396
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,200
on I medical device malfunction related
deaths

397
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,360
and on you know adverse

398
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,530
not patients every year the kids want
into a general bucket up to my

399
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:00,200
device malfunction that can be
adjudicated for clinical causing death

400
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,780
so unintentional you know I think
there's some stuff there interference

401
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,050
yet I get

402
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:12,169
what's up I'll get into a sanctuary but
for the most part they don't

403
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:15,200
um and by default a lot of them are set
not to

404
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,290
or they're very minimal stuff also use
you know some examples here

405
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,490
so whether we get there well to but

406
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,839
I think the for everyone health-care

407
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,270
I'm sure anyone is in health care and on
the security program a big driver and

408
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,200
why we have the security programs is
solely from have a

409
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,980
and anytime we right here by in our
budget request is going to get approved

410
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,049
a source can force us into this checkbox
security and is very

411
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:44,929
a you know it

412
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:48,460
over the last you know five to 10 years
it's we see that

413
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,030
it's very compliance information
assurance driven is going down and check

414
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,080
in those boxes

415
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,419
and writing those policies to me have a
guy lines it's not really looking at it

416
00:34:56,419 --> 00:34:56,929
from

417
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,270
an adversarial resilience type testing

418
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,359
so what caused you know where they're at
the manufactures

419
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,890
same kind of thing they are not designed
for adversarial threats in what we see

420
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,620
in the auto sector those types of things

421
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,640
they're just starting to fill out the
information security teams so

422
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,049
the largest manufactures you know
phyllis you CNN's

423
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:18,569
there'd they're just starting to get you
know executives in the space to can

424
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:19,650
handle

425
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,020
true information security threats not
you know just compliance informations

426
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,290
assurance they don't focus on regulatory
infighting K's in premarket Commission

427
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:28,960
approval

428
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,049
requires for the FDA to you

429
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:36,370
and them fully embraced your partner
with security researcher community

430
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:40,030
we're getting much better come we're
starting to build those relationships

431
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,650
large organizations there's a few
actually smaller

432
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:47,510
harm organizations are doing a really
good job

433
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,310
but for the most part any time we come
into this is you know it's its

434
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:55,040
it stopped according to disclosure is
definitely it softens and downs

435
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,900
the at navigating source the disconnects
from

436
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,960
Health Organization the manufactures
well who in healthcare years

437
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,270
had one reason they say they can't patch
you know the stars devices anyone

438
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:11,020
yeah so she get that allotments its
launch will only

439
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,200
yep he is scum off for years now guys
like the documents on the FDA's website:

440
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,020
their server security clause allows you
to patch these texts devices

441
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,370
is very few cases rices a valid
acceptances on the implant was they do

442
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,330
because there is a direct you know
patient care issue that they have to go

443
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,620
back to use a mission but

444
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,260
90 percent of your medical devices is
not the case been told they can change

445
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,370
our coats for accounts admin accounts

446
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,540
this is another big on you can Tom

447
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,589
but that goes to this next point Abiomed
at and I S information security

448
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:41,290
integration

449
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:47,839
will see that who here has is as biomed
and I S integrated in the organization

450
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,640
ninety-five percent healthcare
organizations don't have some larger

451
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,210
ones are just starting to do it

452
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,780
because realizing the value that
biomedical devices are now connected

453
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,130
and the need to be part of my ass comp
and looking at information security

454
00:36:59,130 --> 00:36:59,760
controls

455
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,450
right now information security reports
an issue on a medical device to the bomb

456
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,120
attack

457
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,280
about midtech gets ahold their
engineering support contract the

458
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,589
manufactures as we have a hardcore to
credential you need to change

459
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:13,660
to which he goes to manufacture I

460
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,430
you know the engineering and support
size manager civil war that's how we

461
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,260
getting all our customers you can change
that time we can change in

462
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,960
Santa comes back as you know kind of an
official on official response from that

463
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,350
organization to the bomb attack back to
information security says a we can

464
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:27,990
change it

465
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,100
who just happens to accept that it can't
be changed it

466
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,130
all along the information security
people don't know the average security

467
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,130
contacts

468
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:41,650
at to manufacture so who here knows if
risk your contacts over at Phillips G

469
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:45,609
you know one person om she's very
important establish those relationships

470
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:46,600
with those folks are

471
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,560
we are working on disclosure with fewer
much to share you some work to do with

472
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,400
Phillips you later

473
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,390
so how did it for keeping act as a big
question this is the way to do it

474
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,210
and go to the dive bar get outta wifi
range this is a guy that's got

475
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,730
infusion pump and he was a sitting at
the bar

476
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:07,109
but out why fire and there's no way I
can act that system cuz it's not on wifi

477
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:09,870
cam first drug labor's direct answer
anything

478
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:14,089
but the smoking and the drinking and the
infusing might get to him first

479
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:18,210
so has has drive around the block all
times you get a good

480
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,930
good I just can't believe this K pat is
my picture dances randomly find it on

481
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,069
the internet

482
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,350
yeah see it mess on I'm from Minnesota
from

483
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,850
its could solutions recommendations what
can you do

484
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:36,520
well attack surface reduction that's a
big one nom use tools like shorthand

485
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,630
an API you know use tools like
Metasploit work or impact or something

486
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,080
like that and actually take a look at
showdowns not

487
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,339
just cuz I found this is a showdown
don't like to show NC II depend test for

488
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:50,819
okay because I does not %uh services
right so do they have to look at that

489
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:54,240
type stuff and look at it from an
adversarial resilience or red team type

490
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,990
approach

491
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:59,310
we need internal programs in health care
that are focused on my device security

492
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,760
I'm working with my manager would biomed
vendor selection process procurement

493
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,080
process is huge

494
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,810
on and really how to build that the
water level is showing

495
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:13,410
that you are when you fix these things
are affecting patient safety

496
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:17,359
affecting your mission values for the
origin is organization

497
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,460
and use two forms these reforms that
vendors fill out

498
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,359
them and typically United do at a
station so

499
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:28,299
there for the most part I keep regular
presentation on

500
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,470
hey this is the MDS to find additional
though and

501
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,690
this is live this lie is a lie to slide
his life on

502
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,799
this is going to the motions but if you
could read those in the contracting and

503
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:38,400
procurement

504
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,630
you have a little bit more success
incorporate indemnification clause in

505
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,770
the contract for

506
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:46,630
by really remediation you already in
your contract if I want texas is so

507
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,520
difficult

508
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,380
you already in the contracting process
has summer as a healthcare organization

509
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,359
this is

510
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,359
we're gonna test this on citrus cuz
we're so thankful I and you actually

511
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,620
take their product and

512
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,780
and you thoroughly tested and on
scissors and thoroughly tested on every

513
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,240
sin

514
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,170
single thin client model that you have
but all you ask is is a secure and they

515
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,810
give you some little tender
documentation and you accept that you

516
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,430
don't go through the motions to STATS

517
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:12,350
than the time we spend the time the
picture on the VMware a shirt

518
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,819
you know I runs on Citrix and others you
know that was not a new process you

519
00:40:15,819 --> 00:40:17,100
already have the process

520
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,720
just at something more for security
check actually make a check not the

521
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,060
check box

522
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,600
alright so silver glitter stuff so

523
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,600
so lectures and to stop on

524
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,960
and is all the VERY leaders they are
external defibrillators

525
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,960
they're used in ambulances and elsewhere
but

526
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,000
a 12-lead other monitoring

527
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,670
on a a on a patient and they're also
connected as you can see here

528
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,350
this is the Verizon these riser AT&T
cellular public networks

529
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,609
to transfer knowledge it's the emergency
department prior to that patient

530
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:55,830
being you know presented her

531
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:01,000
were brought in so these are I he
develops and this web interface is a

532
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,390
most likely the actual receiving texts
system so

533
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:08,810
you get here you can see is our our web
servers the same here

534
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:12,049
to get to the web server oh man you
certainly get hush

535
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:17,089
there's your is it ever gets around the
home page

536
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:21,430
its awesome well they also are the first
to be later

537
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,420
to market with integrated wireless and
Bluetooth by design like I said the use

538
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,580
the a.m. wireless and Bluetooth you know
to

539
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,500
for an application on the positions i
phone and then they also use bluetooth

540
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,180
for

541
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,220
printing that out in the actual
ambulance

542
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,980
and and the use the cellular
connectivity an adapter to transmit that

543
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,510
to the ED

544
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,620
r8 so this is coming sample how you can
use documentation

545
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,630
I have you ever are interested in
researching these devices without having

546
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,480
your hands

547
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,080
on the device I haven't heard research
this device

548
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,910
on so I don't know 100 percent what's
more what's not as my show you an

549
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:58,700
example

550
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,560
I love how you can look at this and get
very detailed information arm

551
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,670
just going of documentation support
manuals are available online

552
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,900
so this is how you would dud reread you
know the config file we know

553
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,900
okay was all configured accident less a
file it sits on that device that handles

554
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,450
all the configuration crafters

555
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,859
for this type device we also know okay

556
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:22,950
now we gotta get the supervisor menu
NARS you that well here's how you get to

557
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,950
the supervisor menu on this
defibrillator

558
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:29,000
and here's all the critical parameter
values that can be altered

559
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,290
and how you alter out and what the
acceptable values for that parameter are

560
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,299
well in order to get a supervisor mode

561
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:40,830
you can see here the top 20 in four
digit code right

562
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,980
kid is getting this thing granted need
code

563
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,319
1234

564
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,359
also back to you blocking question

565
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,680
but I had defaultValue arm

566
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,279
is that just user confirmation they want
their locks

567
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:03,910
you just say yeah our clear boom they're
gone or you can enable the passcode

568
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:09,200
passcode again sets 1234

569
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,760
so really is you know is that a secure
design you know I don't think it is

570
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,970
only guess I have had my hands on this
device to shoot attack service

571
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,260
arm there's wireless there's Bluetooth
there's

572
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,960
you know the cellular stuff I'll forward
defibrillator in is an external

573
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,290
defibrillator don't you hear on

574
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:27,859
color is pretty big attack surface so
was a problem

575
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:32,240
was just a problem with you know the one
product lines or

576
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,410
no there's all your services who runs a
pass codes for the rest their product

577
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,400
lines to

578
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,510
says the answers our series B Series

579
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:42,870
and X-ers the configuration

580
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,220
passwords as well as supervisor sirs
passcodes

581
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,970
and here's the CV ease for those
defibrillators

582
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,350
so we release these at Def Con comin
this was the first time to

583
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:57,359
the now working with CV for a while now
to get

584
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,350
a process in place to track medical
device specific vulnerabilities

585
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,279
so we can get him out you know
responsibly was still get a march to the

586
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:06,080
public

587
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,650
where they have enough useful
information in Archer

588
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:12,910
out information and so these are the
first to see the

589
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,109
is published where we work through that
process

590
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:21,660
so you know hats off to them arm got
some more stuff from a show you here so

591
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,760
how r vendors changing

592
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,760
well the starting gate in with
researchers write Phillips

593
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,670
worked with them they came out this
disclosure positioning shorts you here

594
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:33,540
pretty standard they're gonna come out
with responsible according to a

595
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,799
disclosure policy by the end of the year
for security researchers

596
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,910
to break that barrier that I talked
about arm will not only for security

597
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:44,120
researchers I mean even healthcare
organizations that will vary between the

598
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,990
average security in BioMed never getting
to their security staff

599
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,430
thus allow them to attract them inbound
and

600
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,740
so that there where a moment convicts 11
really good job

601
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,990
I am your Philips and GE as well

602
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:01,130
on handling this type stuff so what's
coming up in the space well

603
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:04,720
scuffle medical device events who made
some progress here

604
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,680
the FDA's actually holding this
first-ever medical device workshop

605
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,260
October 21st 22nd soviet ending

606
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,930
on that and then IEEE and NSF

607
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:17,529
and the server security a policy
research institute or at george

608
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:21,230
washington are holding a secure building
code for medical devices

609
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,779
in November know you're going to that as
well up in you have you heard

610
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:28,049
dozen you know with chopper years things
like that

611
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:32,470
I posted to the Calgary Google Group
last night some sample

612
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:36,580
I code take things that were looking for
that were shot so if you get on there

613
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,620
and have any feedback

614
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,049
just get it back to me nomic sure to
bring it back to these beers already

615
00:45:41,049 --> 00:45:42,089
some progress

616
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:45,730
designers are doing good so was my
upcoming research

617
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:49,060
then you're saying on over the next year
well teamed up again

618
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:52,470
and we're looking at medical device
honeypots is going awesome

619
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:56,130
stowe we want to start gathering some
data on the intentional nurses

620
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,279
unintentional stop

621
00:45:57,279 --> 00:46:01,010
and we also are standing up a

622
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:05,020
you know road honey pots therein
contained fake patient information

623
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,839
and start looking at attack vectors
attack origins those types of things for

624
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:10,150
FTP sites

625
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,359
are so we're putting up honey pots are
in this together soon as data so

626
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,010
hopefully

627
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,160
out the next 12 months RB list are
talking in presenting

628
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,600
so that research also nom

629
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,830
well you know that I am currently
coordinating disclosure

630
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:29,299
I won't say with you but very large
medical device manufacture

631
00:46:29,299 --> 00:46:33,339
on what I believe are potential
vulnerabilities

632
00:46:33,339 --> 00:46:36,670
announced significant number I'm not
talking ten or twenty

633
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,150
and talkin significant our own abilities
over disclosure on

634
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:44,690
so far that manufactures been %uh very
positive to work with

635
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,510
I worked with them previously on they've
been where very responsive and they're

636
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,109
actually doing the right thing in
putting resources behind it

637
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:54,160
on so because of that you know I want to
give them some time

638
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,339
to get those things fix in a shirt spas
experience

639
00:46:57,339 --> 00:47:00,690
the overall because is really your
precedent-setting anti-gun

640
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,760
on what's going to come out of this
one's a big manufacture ands

641
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,120
as we work through the process I think
it'll be the positive for everyone

642
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,740
and know the CV is I have been reserved
for every one of those

643
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:16,170
I they're not publicly release that we
will release some when I disclose it

644
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:16,910
publicly

645
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:20,240
but those will be coming out to Seoul
get a little bit more

646
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,540
Comfort Inn for really really behind
putting these medical device

647
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,940
vulnerabilities through

648
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:29,490
you know CV horse PTV those types of
things

649
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:33,240
so dissolve all helped by sabotage
research a smaller stuff that

650
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,370
then we're going on in space

651
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:41,049
and big thanks to these guys a you know
he stops pokes her inspiration to me

652
00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:44,740
know where they've helped us with their
research and you know thanks to the

653
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,180
you know the various agencies that we
were too they've been great so far

654
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,420
I can see you know nothing negative
about any of them

655
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:54,560
are specifically on here you know thanks
to bill is working with me now working

656
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,450
through this

657
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,080
a disclosure policy I went in for a
bottle so as not to conflict and not

658
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,779
paid to

659
00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:04,210
the archer telling you anything about
Phillips are but they did offer to you

660
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:08,980
to work yet so I think that's a it's a
big win for us overall

661
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:14,930
and as a contact info if you need
anything um many questions

662
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:18,350
non none at all already

663
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:23,100
RA well I will be I'll jump up here if
you want to go and talk to your

664
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,299
healthcare doesn't want to talk to you

665
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:28,060
otherwise the the on/off thanks a lot
%ah
