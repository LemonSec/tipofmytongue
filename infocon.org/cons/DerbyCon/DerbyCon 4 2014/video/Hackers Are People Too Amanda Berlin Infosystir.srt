00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:49,430
I do you know old I'm on the

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,110
%uh let's see here on

46
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,599
I I'm a new when it comes to most think
so

47
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,810
11 not dabbling in power song Python he
and I do a lot of Windows admin stuff

48
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,099
I Meyer fairly new in the Annex

49
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:20,010
doing laws and stuff set and Metasploit
seven-term Lee

50
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,150
at the hospital a in another week I'll
be in education sector

51
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,040
so yay for new jobs and more money

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,280
in

53
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,360
so a little to the stuff to do I'll
Windows admin I am

54
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,060
I run out fishing campaign at the
hospital where we fish

55
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,400
all over internal users I'll for

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,860
user education so the

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,030
decided that we wanted to educator users
because we knew that they were single

58
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,180
most

59
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,299
are single point of failure when it came
to a lot of attacks in our contest

60
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,769
earlier on in the year we do like I'm

61
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:04,260
rewards base so

62
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,400
there they're not shame to report

63
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,650
the fact that I got the reason and
password because if they report it and

64
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,170
they did give it to me they still

65
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,209
they still get I that still benefit to
them

66
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,419
I a manager Sam which

67
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:24,570
is not fun that's probably the worst
part of my job I don't really like you

68
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,440
to call

69
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,900
and you know security in general

70
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,470
you know everything infrastructure we
have a really good team and I'm sure

71
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,580
they'll have an opening soon

72
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,180
if you I careful and see here

73
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,639
other reason why I'm up here a last year

74
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,400
there was an article rayon during Derby
Conn in the local paper

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,410
that painted us in a really negative
light

76
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,580
on it was the first time a jury can last
year was my first time

77
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,590
and it was the first time that I'd ever
relief

78
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,949
fell like I belong so article that they

79
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:05,039
%uh that they put in the paper really
kinda hit home

80
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,350
%uh so new evil hackers are the reason
I'm

81
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,410
a pair a also

82
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,710
Jason had given on talk

83
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,479
at the sides Columbus which i think was
Mike's second

84
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:22,860
third and I had on channel two a lot
this year

85
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,840
this last year and the really
inspirational talk him

86
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,009
I highly recommend washing and I it's

87
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,930
talks a kind about different lights that
hackers are painted

88
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,229
all around the world and for the most
part it's

89
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:41,560
its the same as it is the United States
I mean

90
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,780
I earlier we're at breakfast talking to

91
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,680
a one of the waitresses about you know

92
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,970
before you had met all of us what was
what was your idea what did you

93
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,949
what did you think actors were psych
well somebody that would invade your

94
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:57,610
privacy

95
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,220
somebody you know that has that has
negative intentions at heart

96
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,229
on and now that she knows us

97
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,370
she's you know it it's completely
different

98
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,560
so it

99
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,620
a lot of its just appearances right now
how the media prison

100
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,850
paints now you know what we do and how
we do it

101
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,720
and then doctor whom whose was wearing a
kilt I don't know if he is today but his

102
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,330
he's out there he's when I when I first
online friends

103
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,680
so he's like yeah you need a submit a
talk and I think the only reason he did

104
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,190
it was because he was doing

105
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,490
see if his Circle City cotton and he
needs birth to her

106
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,850
yet so it might have been not just to
help him out but

107
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,000
you got me up here anyways

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,819
cell the prop

109
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,750
in on

110
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,500
I i wrote an article trade common is
called hackers are people too

111
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,069
hence the talk on it it took a little
bit

112
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,169
to get traction with the article on

113
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,560
but it did get me I R to write and a
local

114
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,740
Business Journal a

115
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,069
man you know and got Guinea appear on
stage

116
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:21,319
so there's the article ever I was
actually I actually read Road 84

117
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,440
the the people that don't know who we
are

118
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,690
on it was something that I could point

119
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,259
people to if if the

120
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:36,470
like al you know those hackers they're
all criminals

121
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,430
you know this this is an article that
kinda tells a little bit about what we

122
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,220
do hackers for charity

123
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,750
on and and how it made me feel

124
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,770
and as somebody just finally

125
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,139
belonging that people thought of me like

126
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,009
that you know I've never then the jail
yet

127
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,680
home and yes had heard the night is
still young

128
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,840
um so it

129
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,990
it really really did hit on me so that's
why I wrote the article

130
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,340
I mean pretty put on an imager got some

131
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,990
funny comments got some up people that

132
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,919
thought I was an idiot but that's the
Internet cell

133
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,030
Anthony freaked out yet a

134
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,030
I'm internally freaking out all the time

135
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:31,129
on just because i'm new to this who
cares what I have to say

136
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:35,620
man in it surprises me %uh there's some
people that

137
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,539
have been in the industry for such a
long time have blogs at books have

138
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,580
you notes offer they've written you know
our heads the company's

139
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,920
and they still have in her freaking out

140
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,250
you know it never never really truly
goes away on

141
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,300
I think it was bob dole brenna wrote an
article

142
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,860
that %uh top kinda talked about you know

143
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,070
I'm I don't know what I'm talking about
liar liar these people I do people care

144
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,490
when these people are even listening to
me

145
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,959
on so it it's really amazing to know
that I'm not the only one

146
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:11,820
and it's not just new Center freaking
out its it's pretty much everybody

147

148
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:18,560
I'm are pointed to a much different
articles online on

149
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,110
how to speak an hour and have not to
freak out I'm up here

150
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,610
but a when I get out here

151
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,760
I know having people anyways you should

152
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,250
sheesh in I'm so getting article out
there was

153
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,760
was kinda difficult I tried to get it to
some local papers

154
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,470
didn't really want to publish it on you
know I i'm

155
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,899

156
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:49,330
the email addresses of probably fifty or
sixty local newspapers

157
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,690
and rely on southern Michigan and not

158
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,160
they not nobody cares like nobody want
to print the article

159
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,560
I mean in I don't know how you normally
go about that I think they have kinda

160
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,529
come find you but yeah you know the next
day they printed

161
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:08,339
an article about why the Christmas
lights were still up downtown

162
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,370
surge it with it that hurt me a little
bit

163
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,329
com so he had tried to put it out there
is much like %uh Thailand

164
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:21,640
some hits you know people community like
10 they shared Hatton

165
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,410
on my mom liked it I guess that's
clinton's

166
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,880
your

167
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,990
alright so then I just decided I'll just
talk to everybody about it

168
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,820
on so you know I've I went to go get a
%ah an x-ray dots I'm talking to the

169
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,040
x-ray tech I'm talking to the lady
that's take my blood pressure and i've

170
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,350
seen

171
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,430
oh yeah you know I'm a hacker and I work
here and

172
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,260
you know this is what we do in destra
the

173
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,300
white that came on and people like Weiss

174
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,870
place really like yeah really to me

175
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,940
game this is horrible but shook it Paul
yet

176
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,310
I'll and it also kinda got me on my
shelf so

177
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,410
I had quite some time where I was really
withdrawing

178
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,040
and I didn't I mean I still don't like
people but I like you people also that

179
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,620
that nice %uh hidup

180
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,050
yet and

181
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,800
so it'd it got me talking and I was
something that I could talk to anybody

182
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,060
about you and they're gonna learn
something

183
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,920
you know most people don't know any of
this Obama actually got

184
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,640
some feedback that like oh my god I
needle I need to tell

185
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,370
my boss about this because we are having
so lemme so much problem getting

186
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,959
traction

187
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,130
you know and and sea level i in on

188
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,620
InfoSec because the think she said

189
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,529
i mean they don't realize that we're
hackers to and the stuff some porn

190
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,730
in so this is another positive feedback

191
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,450
I've been told that I've really hard
time taking compliments

192
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,990
so I sucked it up and put it on a slide

193
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:09,440
in sheesh

194
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,100
and thanks to bill Gardner he pointed
out the documentary that

195
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,459
I accidentally stole the title from %uh

196
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,740
I was like all this is pretty cool off
to say hackers are people too because we

197
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,350
are

198
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,110
and then I'm like oh shit there's
there's already a documentary out there

199
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,209
on it so I but I apologize

200
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,930
%uh so there's the link to the
documentary on I did watch it

201
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,019
afterwards skull comets it's very nice

202
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,000
the they cover some of the same stuff
that I do on

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
but i me mine has a little bit different
spin on them

204
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,110
and there's my negative feedback a so
the reason I wanted to get in the local

205
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,279
paper is because

206
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,240
so often I read up the

207
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,730
oh the comments on their on the online
paper and its

208
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,050
fall just stupid in school

209
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:08,519
controls unlike its I wanted some
negative feedback just so I could use it

210
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,139
for

211
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:13,550
for a slide right and that's all that i
cud I'm

212
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,639
I know I wanted that I wanted the
comments so bad

213
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,970
I just just for that purpose and

214
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,329
you know I get yelled at for stealing
the title also

215
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:28,839
a accidentally accidentally didn't do it
on purpose

216
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,880
I swear

217
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,279
so I got some illegal questions to on
which I tried it

218
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,100
incorporating slide other than the
simple stuff that you guys

219
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,389
should all know about expire and stuff
um

220
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,730
and teasing so lot

221
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,930
didn't realize the different kinds hacks
fact that you know

222
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,010
the hackers they normally talk about on
TVR

223
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,970
black hat Arthur criminals there's there
such a big difference so that's a a lot

224
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,920
of the questions that I got

225
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,180
and we fix my PC Laois comes up

226
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,740
in so the breakdown for the sea levels
are trying to through these ones

227
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,339
a little bit faster CAS I think most you
should know about this

228
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,790
that are covered anyways om so all the
hats

229
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,209
on I added purple hat on here job
because

230
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,510
will the purple team you know a little
bit up literary little bit a blue

231
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,320
on K it's a team thing we're a happy
thing but I A

232
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:36,320
it blew was on there already is so I I
had for purple honor

233
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,529
so the white hat on this is

234
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:44,740
this is what the sea level need to know
about you know your ICP 0 CEC %eh

235
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,850
on and in this is this is us wanting to
help the community this is

236
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,610
you know wat r CIO's are sometimes white
hats

237
00:14:53,610 --> 00:15:00,250
I'm you know it's helpful to get that
information out there

238
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,079
the Black Cats you know paid they don't
care

239
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,430
there does but does the guys on TV

240
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,800
and the grey hat on another good thing
that I was

241
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,790
I'll that was pointed out to me is that
could be like a a white hat white hat

242
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,199
hacker by day

243
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:24,199
and black at night in or it could be 10
a little bit about

244
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,779
here what's up there

245
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:32,860
should we go back to that

246
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,230
I tried to get the image big butt in

247
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,350
right the good stuff so last year I was
amazed sitting at closing ceremonies

248
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,279
watching these people did on just

249
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,459
stuff télécharger to raise money for
hackers shared you know people walking

250
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,360
around in

251
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,949
and zombie makeup and it it was

252
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:58,399
it was really inspiring to see the
amount that people cared

253
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,810
nom for that an organization Tom

254
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,860
and I think who told me what Def Con

255
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,779
made it was like 30s 36,000

256
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:12,009
yeah I think death had hit 36,000 so

257
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,529
we have two beat that did she

258
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:18,769
we'll see how they can a limited
attendance this year for every time so

259
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,420
we didn't sit so close together

260
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,019
i'd see you guys are having a problem
but

261
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:29,329
I a hidden it

262
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:32,259
I knew it was going to be limited
attendance you still like tripled my

263
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,490
first talk

264
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,630
which is great on

265
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,720
they did the blood coating it def con
again and

266
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,180
EF after some really cool stuff

267
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,850
oh and I think they did blood marrow
donations

268
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,509
and something else I can remember

269
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,320
some more good stuff on you know
anonymous being

270
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,329
on something that a lot of people sees
as being negative

271
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,139
bit also do some I really cool stuff

272
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:08,370
be and this I'm I was surprised not too
many people knew about

273
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,530
are so movie X who was one of the first
people I met an industry

274
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,949
Lasher Derby Conn I did a I for CTF also

275
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,549
and on he does this thing called project
mentor that

276
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:23,260
used to be like every other week or so
now I think it's about every month he

277
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,949
puts out a new challenge

278
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,339
and it doesn't matter how technically
you are

279
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,070
how old you know how much I knew that
you think you are

280
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,500
he will teach you something om I think

281
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,860
policy here this last this last month
was about eleven

282
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,220
nation so he gives you a website he says

see what you can find here any questions
your email I am

284
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,419

it's for nothing it's just so he can

285
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,539
open the community

286
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:53,919
and it's absolutely amazing on this some
people that I'm

287
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,080
know that we're working out also that
her blog post detailing

288
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,830
their thought process and how they went
about each one of these challenges

289
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,160
and it helped me out a lot I mean I
didn't even know what's Kayla's

353
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,640

recently anything on reddit

354
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,539
where a bunch people are asking them
questions they can many

355
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:08,539
that can help is as well as you know

356
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:13,120
reverse engineering %uh vehicle software
and

357
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,750
you know working with automakers working
with lawmakers they'd

358
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,880
the other dudes really great things in
the community to

359
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,450
then and this is kinda cool

360
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,890
on E this Nathan I

361
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,409
think it's he feared maybe on

362
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:33,900
E just about old E

363
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,390
and I know people say we need to come up
with something better than hacker as a

364
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,320
word

365
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,530
bullets it I like that word

366
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,480
cyclically should use a grin and murder
and torture to the word

367
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,390
it's just that the EON the the media and
everybody else

368
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,299
tends to use that always with a negative
connotation

369
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:57,070
and Dom they're criminals they're not
they're not hack my other hackers to

370
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,240
but they're their criminal hackers I'm
so differentiating between

371
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,169
on black and white hat when I'm speaking
is kinda hard like a

372
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:12,809
I didn't realize how often you just
can't throw that word around

373
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:17,130
and you people all you know the
volunteers

374
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,419
the people that showed up at nine
o'clock AM on a Saturday

375
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:23,690

380
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,370
a trolling but in a

381

bad way you know there's there's a lotta

385

sterling regs I had I had to do it

388
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,059

the ugly side

389
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,820
on unfunded on he

390
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,990
there's there's a lot of just ugly stuff
out there that

391
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,730
make people think that where you know
were bad media jumping to conclusions

392
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,529
that kinda stuff

393
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:34,740
and what you can do. I'm I tried to do a
12 step program I need

394
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,330
I need another one so %uh the it

395
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:43,299
also we'll see if I can I can find
another slide add to I'm

396
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:47,860
yes alright so there's there was a good
there was a three to one roll right

397
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,570
it's %uh three hours a sleep in

398
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:56,049
two meals on and i won shower but now we
made the five four three two one roll

399
00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:01,419
its 53 applications a deodorant four
bottles of water

400
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:05,309
bitch three hours a sleep two meals and

401
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:08,529
one shower not all at the same time

402
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:11,740
throughout the day so

403
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,890
thats that the new that general should
everybody should follow it every con

404
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,110
so if you're organizing hun on get the
local media involved I think they did

405
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,340
that really well

406
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,520
armed at several cans and identity like
being proactive letting them know hey

407
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,760
where hackers were here and this is what
we're doing and we're not just morning

408
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,679
to

409
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,640
pick locks to get in your house but
heard on

410
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,440
in

411
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,580
I i think they're to custom here so
don't be a douchebag

412
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:51,100
com 18 it should go without saying the
but I and and I haven't run into a whole

413
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,309
lot but there are people out there that
you're like gathered just

414
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:57,760
yeah I went to a con in Columbus

415
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,120
and you know there's the you know that
guy

416
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,029
that's out there talking about how
awesome we are and how we can get into

417
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:08,740
your bank account and just spouting of
crap

418
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,309
sue you know what in front of an entire
Bossa people did

419
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:16,549
didn't know why we were there

420
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:20,779
they'd you know it it just is really
really bad taste in people's mouths when

421
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,679
you know there's this

422
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,900
this little old couple that that here
that kinda crap

423
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,510
in

424
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,270
so the big time if you're on you know
newspapers TV just tryin mention black

425
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,679
cat

426
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,880
and seller a criminal hacker instead o

427
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,400
just just after in

428
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,179
and social media to I've ahead I've
kinda slacked on this one as far as like

429
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,340
correcting people if they say e

430
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,789
just hacker on but most the people I
talk to you already know so it kinda

431
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:56,169
just

432
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:59,340
slips my mind om and

433
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,230
in normal conversation around I'm I'm on
Facebook and stuff but Ryan

434
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,840
up like for the love of God somebody
logging in your Facebook is not hacking

435
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,960
in so

436
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,029
preach the word on I was

437
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:18,490
I had no idea what in for a sec what's I
didn't realize that's what I was doing

438
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,960
I didn't realize I was on the blue team
are ready for five years

439
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,970
on I think a lot of small organizations
and smaller IT places don't realize

440
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,960
that thats you know been for the most
part everybody the blue team

441
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,140
that knows anything about security in

442
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,000
in smaller organizations are I mean a
larger ones usually have a lot

443
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,190
I'll more and up coverage when it comes
to this stuff but

444
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,440
on the sea levels also don't really know

445
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,740
a whole lot about it unless you have
somebody from the bottom knows

446
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:58,340
kind of pushing at upwards do

447
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,600
so getting people involved on

448
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,370
I have like standard I

449
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,980
I'm cookie-cutter emails that I like to
send out for people that wanna now

450
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,890
like like things like you know me don't
click on shit

451
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,399
you know %ah on a

452
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:21,020
good password management skills you know
we had something at work the other day

453
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,890
that was a %ah

454
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,360
Family Feud style on

455
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,490
what's the most common password game me
enough for people that came by

456
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,419
and really got them interact in with us

457
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:37,600
and they're like we'll you know we have
you know

458
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,299
10 pastors that we have to remember how
we how we can remember all these see

the worst customer service when it's
your own family so it's going to be this

473
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,370
huge organization that we just love each
other's family provide

474
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,330
you know the free tech support that we
would be anyways just with our blood

475
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,340
pressure is rising

476
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:43,340
and without having have offered
Thanksgiving conversation

477
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,880
now so yup II can skip to head on that
one but in

478
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:54,299
another really cool thing in tact for
kids on

479
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,490
my friend Michael Lee went and spoke I
at

480
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,179
at their little thing in Chicago which
was amazing you know you have

481
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:04,570
all these little kids trying to learn
you know how to hack him

482
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,870
you know he did down Wireshark stuff

483
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,840
and you know getting them interested in
what pic and they have a whole thing at

484
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,140
dusk on for kids

485
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,880
and Dom very very very cool I I really
wanted to take my son because he seems

486
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,500
just

487
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,950
I don't push my interests on him but he
really does seems

488
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,520
I'll it well as long as im in involves
my next

489
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,309
he's interested in itself

490
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:33,200
in

491
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,760
so show your show your passion I put
east on here which I don't like

492
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,880
is that what they're doing next order
don't go there yet

493

did at besides Nashville

the organization that I'm leaving is on

520

de dome they don't sympathize with the
users they

522
