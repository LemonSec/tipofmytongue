00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,640
hope

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,900
tales are ready on today my name's
run-a-ball

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,600
I'm Jim Matthews can make today she's my
PhD advisor Clarkson University

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,630
compasses are working towards my PhD
dissertation

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,010
us layer 2 network security a
virtualized environments or

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,470
is a little about myself Hama the
computer science PhD student at I Heart

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,690
University hermoso full-time lecturer to
I'm sorry Polytechnic Institute in New

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,180
York

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,320
I'm also a software engineer for Excel
sink Armada fair for all

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,090
and not rome new york animosity owner
about consulting company called at

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,410
around

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,190
IT solutions doctor matthew is an
associate professor for the department

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:46,899
which science

14
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:51,460
Clarkson University I'll case someone I
basically over the at check to my

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,180
research

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,730
I'm talked a bit about virtualization
just a brief overview mom talk about

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,660
multi-tenancy

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,620
common and go over some virtual
networking options like bridging is

19
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,170
watching

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,370
on the talk about layer 2 network
attacks which mostly cash cow be

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,400
familiar with already

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,380
on then I intend to give a demo
hopefully it'll work out well for us

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,630
are discussed my results and then hope
we'll have some time for discussion

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,220
is a cloud services or raise public
cloud services by now

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,880
most likely mark I'm reading this room
is using some sort of formal cloud

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,610
services

27
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,159
I'm specifically looking at multi-tenant
environments offer virtualization

28
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,170
Thompson is a virtual machines are
typically all connect to a single

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,270
virtual network

30
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,070
a device within a single host RBC's
could be using a virtual bridge

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,700
or virtual switch depending on the
environment nominees are just software

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,350
emulated

33
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,750
versions about these physical devices
wing

34
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,470
so the question I pose this is all
client virtual machines are essentially

35
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,490
connected to a virtual version of a
physical networking device

36
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,570
a typical layer 2 network attacks that
work and physical device is applied to

37
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,159
the ritual counterpart so can we use
things like Mac flooding

38
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,270
UN hopping and what not to actually I'm
infiltrate these virtual devices

39
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,210
oscalus important question explore
because all services that are in the

40
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,840
cloud that rely on virtualized
environments could be vulnerable to

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
these attacks

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,770
ominous includes data centers hosting
you know client said today to

43
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,730
I'm in their environments I'll so let's
look at a hypothetical case your call

44
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,569
purses pappy

45
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:18,910
especially to rival coal companies on
what if they host their data services

46
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,200
the same provider I would it is virtual
servers were called located on the same

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,360
host

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,760
and with what there was a fairly easy
way for once again gain a competitive

49
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,890
edge over the other

50
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,200
Wong it's a basic overview
virtualization we have a bunch of

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,440
physical servers we consolidate took
them to a single host a lot more

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,319
resources available to it the not the
actual other machines

53
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,500
giving us energy cost savings our music
giving us a better efficiency at our

54
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,510
resources and utilization of our
resources

55
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,739
the new typically would have so in this
case i have a web server email server

56
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,360
file server application server

57
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,420
all consolidated on this larger
virtualization server

58
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,780
if we take a look at the inside this box
we can see the host OS would have 32

59
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,780
gigabytes of RAM

60
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,300
maybe sixteen CPU cores and then we see
all these machines are stuffed inside a

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,970
each

62
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,280
taking a little slice of those resources
that are available from the machine

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,920
what arm so at SUNY up Ali we we have

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,440
the centralized virtualization arm
environment that we use for our school

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,690
arm so dorm user's computer lab users a
remote users K

66
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,890
all access their thirst drop
environments within this

67
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,200
the single server I'll allowing them you
know

68
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,909
access from all across the campus are
outside the campus or what not on all in

69
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,180
a centralized environment

70
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,280
and we have a heterogeneous mix of
systems that are on there

71
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,340
on this is different for decentralized
virtualization which a lot of people are

72
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,409
used to with VirtualBox VMware

73
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:42,450
I'm reaction have your own host your own
system may be a laptop

74
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,890
or another physical a larger computer on
this hosting virtual machines was more

75
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,940
isolated and actually I a centralized

76
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,760
solution that has many people using the
same system for their virtualized

77
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,989
I machines little so multi tennessee is
basically cloud service providers are

78
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,810
trying to maximize the resources

79
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,650
so what they're going to do is gonna
take a bunch of the answer to budget for

80
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,349
clients

81
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:07,470
stickam I'm one box in and pretty much
try to use all the resources they cannot

82
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,500
that box toolbox come saturated

83
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,409
on the Maven overextend things by using
something like a thin provisioning for

84
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:17,359
for dry space are what not these are
heterogeneous environments they have

85
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,340
different operating systems running
different services will give when X

86
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,530
Window System sinus

87
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,590
environment you must be running web
services FTP services

88
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,570
application servers or whatever I'll but
client access the VM's very so someone

89
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,030
can be former privileges you going grab
an Amazon ec2 instance you can actually

90
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,380
no

91
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,699
set up your own tea and install
everything from scratch the forward

92
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:38,710
access

93
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,750
on someone actually give you prick and
tablets com some may restrict

94
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,740
arm what you can do with me to give you
the PSD just give you a shout

95
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,449
restrictive access you can get weirder
was not on there

96
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:53,800
I'll so you're just a couple of examples
and multi-tenancy impostors writers have

97
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,850
him as I need to sue Microsoft

98
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,780
as irv Google phone service is known as
a buncha fly by night dps is out there

99
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,650
who dis Google virtual private server
even find tons of

100
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,270
on different virus out there a
brick-and-mortar data centers sought

101
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,610
most your post.really with someplace
maybe in your local area that's hosting

102
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,440
for local clients or what not

103
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,419
i mean they have all the local area
clients host on virtualization servers

104
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,150
in their environment our server racks

105
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,610
all connected the same physical network
maybe some your competitors are each

106
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,300
other

107
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,300
on but they're all hosting in that same
area so the similarities a visa summer

108
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,199
running some form

109
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,660
open source and are XenServer some use
VMware hyper-v

110
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,600
combo although share a single network
connections between the tennis right so

111
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,090
they're all on the same physical holster
maybe bulk of its cohost everyone and

112
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,560
that single physical host

113
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,120
is all connected to either virtual
bridge or virtual switching device

114
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,620
well so here's a certain kind of an
overview multi-tenancy we again see our

115
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,780
host OS with 32 gigabytes of memory

116
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,110
16 CPU cores in this case sexual Coke
and Pepsi

117
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,050
I'm just you know they both have web
servers they both have some DNS servers

118
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,280
on the same host

119
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,160
maybe an application server I was a
pepsi has DVI serve around here working

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,600
on it maybe they're dealing with the
tracking information

121
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,990
ombre their customer base informational
on but the idea here is that they're all

122
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,930
hosting on the same physical server

123
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,729
hosting the virtual servers I'm in all
the information is is using

124
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:17,020
sitting on the same fiscal hard drive
space using the same Ethernet physical

125
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,560
adapter going out to the physical
network on and maybe it's just you know

126
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,650
bridged or switched cool

127
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,090
here we're seeing to physical network
interfaces one is dedicated for the host

128
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,120
OS for administrative purposes

129
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,699
and the other ones actually dedicated
for the virtual machines to use to get

130
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,080
out the physical network

131
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,199
now when I don't show is here on you
know we would have some sort a bitch

132
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,419
first would have some sort of virtual
switch or bridge

133
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,080
under those machines are connected to
actually is bridging over to that

134
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,560
physical interface

135
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,539
while okay so let's talk about bridging

136
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:50,960
on physical bridges connect to a more
layer 2 network segments

137
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,979
I'm going to separate collision domains
us we should have some sort of isolation

138
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,319
of traffic

139
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,110
Rd maintain a mac address forwarding
table for each other side the segment

140
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,340
I'm so basically if if some machines or
premise at the segments missions over

141
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,639
the other side the bridge

142
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,250
army from if the machine on one side the
bridge wants to send a packet over to

143
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,229
another she on the same seems to the
bridge

144
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,470
it will cross %uh the bridge or to make
the communication

145
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,599
on but it was sent packing over to the
other side the bridge in that packet has

146
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:18,020
to cross the bridge

147
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,690
aren't to get over the other side this
is based on the mac Address is in a

148
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,490
stable

149
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,009
so just a basic image it that we have
three on one side three and the other

150
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,500
because the mac Address is so that top
machine over and once I want to talk to

151
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,580
one on the bottom

152
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,680
it's not gonna cross the bridge can hit
that side the bridge to say I look at my

153
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,500
table

154
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,490
home I see the mac Address is still on
your side on your segment source going

155
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,169
to keep that

156
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:42,340
arm network traffic on that side of the
bridge otherwise will travel over to the

157
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,979
other side to say you know the top she
wants talks mill machine on the other

158
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:45,729
side

159
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:50,180
and we traverse the bridge on texan
midtech communication happening

160
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,190
so virtual bridges are the simplest form
a virtual networking

161
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,410
the use 8.o 2.1 d Ethernet bridging
which is built into Linux kernel

162
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,800
and then we use this user space opera do
tells package or actually

163
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,810
work with those bridging on the Virgin
kernel driver

164
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,800
uses a virtual cap interface to connect
these machines to the virtual bridge

165
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,879
and it's just basically a userspace
network at comet simulating that where

166
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,410
to when we play our connection

167
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,060
between the machines and the actual
networking device while

168
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,569
to have inserted the virtual bridge in
this case it's in San world's called Br

169
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:22,490
0

170
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,280
I mean we have attacked interfaces I
need to the virtual machines is

171
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,610
connecting to that bridge

172
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,129
which eventually gets down to that
physical interface that they need to get

173
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,319
outside to the real world

174
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,909
physical environmental but they are all
correct that physical bridging were also

175
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,930
immersing separate individual network
segments here

176
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,039
what so this differs from switching
comps switching does

177
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,260
operate a layer to hire such as layer to
like bridging on switches are considered

178
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,730
as multi-core bridges we all probably no
one here

179
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,080
they do separate collision domains each
port on the bridge is so little

180
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,910
collision domains

181
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,170
the big thing this %ah separate switches
from bridges we have a cam people

182
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,560
ominous camp there was talk on to
address will memory arm

183
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,589
it's similar to the for a table we see
in bridges however

184
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,470
basis is a dynamic table that maps the
ports to the mac Address is that the

185
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,360
machines that are connected

186
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,769
that poor now we could have multiple mac
address is assigned to that poor because

187
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:12,519
we had could have

188
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,310
switches that are daisy chained to each
other that portion of all the

189
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,500
Mac addresses that are basically you
know %uh plant to that one single core

190
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,050
arm daisy chained up the other switches
sus allows us which is too intelligent

191
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,459
police are some traffic from one part to
the next are based upon what mac Address

192
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:30,459
is a connected

193
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:33,300
so that you know we're not broadcasting
that traffic across the whole tire

194
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,779
switch

195
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,339
as in the case of a hop on really with
that with the switch needs to do this in

196
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,279
his check the frame header information

197
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,300
are not the Jeffrey am going across a
network for that mac Address

198
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,910
I meant for traffic based upon the mac
address after it looks at his campaign

199
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,880
was okay this

200
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,149
missed is on this port over here this is
on that port over there

201
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:54,120
but the big thing to know here's the
switches are embedded devices now and

202
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,399
have a finite amount a memory available
to them

203
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,029
I'm so was that can people fills up as a
going to a hub motor a fail-safe mode

204
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:04,610
I which ends up basically stopping all
the traffic to every connected device

205
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:09,880
were here except picture Ethernet frame
we see the preamble the destination

206
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,920
address which is extracted out

207
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,260
common especially with the switch needs
to know in order to actually for that

208
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,209
traffic and

209
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:19,700
we do have cut-through switching in
store for more but really both I need to

210
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,970
know what that destination mac Address
is

211
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,279
Order Complete activity of sending that
the network packet while

212
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,920
cool so here I just %uh sure switch I
have a few machines connected to differ

213
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,779
port so we can see the mac Address is up
on top there we can see is just

214
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,399
basically a cam careful

215
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,529
I mean we have one mac Address playing
too poor to one back in just 24 /7

216
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,740
and so on assault force of the machine
up or two would like to talk machine at

217
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,940
4:14

218
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,990
on basis ends up the packet the switch
trips up but the frame Hatter

219
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,140
looks for the mac address after the
destination matches against scam people

220
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,769
and then sends the packet accordingly
across the switch onto that Singapore so

221
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:56,190
the flooding of course

222
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,620
on the traffic across all courts all the
machines canción

223
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,300
cool so virtual switches in advance for
the virtual networking just like their

224
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,769
physical counterparts they can

225
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:08,420
deal with layer to hire information
depending on the switch in the

226
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,980
capabilities that switch

227
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm so we can do things like you last
the UN configurations performance

228
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,350
monitoring

229
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,860
and so forth on content filtering if we
get as high as I

230
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,750
application layer switch Tom and they
they all connect somewhere like a a

231
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,190
liquor

232
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,910
a bridge were using those virtual
interfaces arts connected devices to the

233
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,510
actual switch themselves

234
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,220
while so here we see I've replaced
average without with a virtual switch in

235
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,820
this case NBR 0

236
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,850
in which the virtual interfaces for each
other machines the virtual machines on

237
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,190
that post environment are connected to
that virtual switch

238
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,790
I'm in iraq attacks that fiscal network
interface to go off the fiscal

239
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,709
network well so their variety a virtual
switch is available

240
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,750
on typically these are associated with
some sorta different um

241
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,920
hypervisor environment we see open peace
which is usually on nice n environments

242
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,300
or Citrix XenServer uses this by default

243
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,870
I'm Kb environments approx max is
another hypervisor the uses open the

244
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,760
switch

245
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,529
on the Cisco Nexus 1000v serious eyes a
VMware the sphere add-ons which you can

246
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:09,990
also use the Microsoft hyper-v
environments

247
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,089
arm and is a Microsoft hyper-v virtual
switch was the default virtual switch

248
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:15,470
for the hyper-v environments

249
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,589
and if you look at yes XI for free
spirit they have their own default

250
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:22,600
I V switch available to so the Nexus
1000v is something you can buy separate

251
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,200
or use the free addition to can
incorporate that in

252
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,779
on all these are considered as
enterprise level solutions sole

253
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:31,630
from open the switch which is the open
source piece which all the way up to the

254
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,060
six

255
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,720
us a Cisco Nexus 1000v they're all
enterprise level switches

256
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,110
she would think they would have some
sort enterprise-level functionality or

257
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,420
protection against some sort of attack

258
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,010
okay so basic network a layer 2 network
attacks on Mac flooding how many guys

259
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,420
done Mac flooding in here

260
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,070
misrule case you people rights pretty
easy to do is run a command just want to

261
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,860
network with a buncha mac Address is

262
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,850
arm what that does it fills up that cam
table on forces the switch into a hard

263
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,920
mode if it doesn't know how to protect
itself against that

264
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,790
arm so that all the frames are forward
across the network and everybody can

265
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,709
hear what's going on that's which you
can start eavesdropping on traffic

266
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:08,930
replay packets

267
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:13,000
all that good stuff I this works well
I'm most physical switches newscorp well

268
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,730
for about 20 years almost physical
switches so this is something you would

269
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,420
think would be

270
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,630
fixed in the software version of a
physical sweat right

271
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,070
I'm when we go to emulate these devices
we could look at it you know all the

272
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,709
the vulnerabilities or so share with
them and should according to look for

273
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:29,490
checks or what not to actually prevent
this from occurring

274
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,870
arm this is typically mitigated on
physical switches by using port security

275
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,570
which Cisco has invited the most the
devices I'll

276
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,570
the only virtual switch offers this type
uva protection would be the Cisco Nexus

277
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,930
1000v but the enterprise level one you
have to pay for

278
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,850
this free version does not offer this
protection I'll

279
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,920
UN hopping is another layer to attack on
base in which you can do is take a frame

280
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,670
its II

281
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,279
utica up machines actually plug into a
truck Porter default the UN

282
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm so has access to multiple virtual
and I mess which

283
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,060
on me know what you can do as you can
modify the deal and tagged

284
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,190
on your frame and try to put yourself I
was other view as the target UN you want

285
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,570
to get on president view and you
currently on

286
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,480
I'm so get requires access to the
default the lawn or the truck for

287
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,660
are many could be mitigated by strict
%um configuration so basically any

288
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,010
devices that are connected to a switch
port is configured as a truck for review

289
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,589
and

290
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:26,790
it shouldn't be a should be just connect
to a port that you know specifics that

291
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,610
you end up that

292
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,209
device should be I'm associated with so
can mitigate this by strict feeling

293
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,370
configuration the physical switch ports

294
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:40,220
while DHCP attacks so we could put a
rogue DHCP server and virtual network

295
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,199
arm we have two main DHCP server was
giving addresses

296
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:48,220
maybe class start associating to this
role ok on DHCP server restarts entering

297
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,399
the requests

298
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,430
I'm so then they start getting these
rogue services like DNS and TFTP so what

299
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,600
happens if we get I'm

300
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,470
associate with a DNS service actually
poisoned when %uh things like baking

301
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,980
sites and I want to make it look like

302
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,399
real but they're my site you know and i
got plans for so for those in capturing

303
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,519
passwords

304
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,670
I'll or what not cycle poison that DNS
server TFTP if we got devices like cell

305
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,190
phones are hard phones

306
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,329
arm envoy plant our phones usually
Poulter TFTP information

307
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:19,810
are based upon what they get from DHCP
so forgive a role TFTP server we can do

308
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,269
is

309
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:23,420
maybe put a malicious some firmware out
that phone

310
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,750
a subpoena physical environment an NFL
QB you know sending packets out to some

311
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,190
other destinations we can start
eavesdropping on those conversations

312
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,480
can also create create that denial of
service %uh situations by giving

313
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,269
duplicate addressing on the network

314
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,920
I'm so we can actually start blocking
out services based upon that

315
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,310
so it can be mitigated by forcing static
address in Beckett's really cover some

316
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,300
in a in a very large environment so

317
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,839
when you're dealing with like 1000 10000
she's an environment you can rely on

318
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,269
DHCP it actually

319
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:53,660
push out all those addresses accordingly
baby has a static address in for your

320
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,610
servers

321
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,610
I'll most of the store different DHCP
server on there and tell your client to

322
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,209
grab a DHCP addresses

323
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,750
some laws are gonna so sheets that rogue
DHCP server war

324
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,170
those are personal things just
broadcasting fake are our prosecution

325
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:08,870
Pattaya

326
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,800
messages to a network used to hijack
traffic put ourselves in in a man in the

327
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,940
middle to eavesdrop on traffic to
manipulate flow of traffic

328
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,970
arm this could be mitigated by using
static our country's

329
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,949
again the overlooked in our cable on a
machine and you're dealing with a

330
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:23,570
thousand ten thousand sheen's

331
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,980
wants to go around and modify our tables
on every single machine under static

332
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,930
countries is just not

333
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,310
not feasible to do I'm Susa something
that's hard to prevent

334
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:37,259
cool so it's looking a malicious p.m. in
a multi-tenant cloud environment

335
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:40,630
on here we go again we see the host OS
with 32 gigabytes a memory

336
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,040
16 CPU cores and we have all that the
servers around there before but also

337
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,209
call close a malicious app server

338
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:49,680
comment the next something that's
actually coast are trying to eavesdrop

339
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,639
on the traffic the patch is generating

340
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,949
so here we see that that motion zaps
arbors not connected to the same virtual

341
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,750
switches the other machines in that

342
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,810
virtual network I'm so we can see that
looking at the lair to attacks are just

343
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,699
discussed you know something could
happen here

344
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:07,760
I we tried to Mac flooding attack on
this environment and possibly start

345
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,010
eavesdropping on all the traffic this
going across the network

346
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,069
he said like to give a little time on
this and I would have done so far as

347
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,100
I've actually

348
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,490
I'm done the Mac flooding attacks and of
like to show you guys that here right

349
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:19,890
now

350
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,939
on the show you that this is actually
effective in certain environments

351
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,030
ha so this is a the Sony poly a cloud
security reach

352
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,289
Research Lab whichever a dedicated
server rack aunt

353
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:33,160
for this research us here we have many
different hypervisor environments

354
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,780
arm in this rack ops want to show this
to you guys we actually had this really

355
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,049
large dracula much good stuff in it

356
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:43,020
0 yet so the first attack I'm gonna
shows a Mac flooding attack unabridged

357
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,809
interface using Gentoo Linux

358
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:48,760
open source and and when it's cruel
bridging they intend to show a Mac

359
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,220
flooding attack and virtual switch
interface using Gentoo open source and

360
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:52,750
in the latest

361
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,710
open the switch arm and the Mac flooding
attack and a virtual switch interface

362
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,280
using

363
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,690
Citrix XenServer I'll show hands who
thinks that the bridge

364
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,150
attack is going to work little

365
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,450
okay what about the open peace which me
model

366
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,250
and what about Citrix XenServer in okay

367
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,710
sheesh let's go up here and try to sell

368
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,559
cool I'll

369
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,799
so we can see here this just using a
Gentoo colonels

370
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,210
of three to 10 to seven young

371
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,559
what and I've got a bridge interface
setup

372
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,429
on the second interface on the server
which is GNP 4s 0 for

373
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:39,360
over on this side each of these systems
has out to Cali Lynn expert or machines

374
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,090
on them I have a

375
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,070
labeled as Kali one in Kali to on Cali
one is going to be using

376
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,789
links to actually just access the
internet and a star surfing the web page

377
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,340
on Kali to is is going to be running the
Mac flooding attack in a mosque in the

378
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,780
running TCP down Texas that the traffic

379
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,900
attempt to capture that traffic among

380
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,460
so let's see training a screen session
here

381
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,049
while

382
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,830
while 1

383
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,789
little so I gotta love script running on
each of these this just basically

384
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:14,880
running TCP down

385
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,990
and is targeting but in this case Cali
one I'm specifically by the

386
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,150
IP address and I'm just looking for HTTP
traffic I'm going across the networks

387
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,640
I'm just kind of filtering out for the
HTTP traffic

388
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,710
I we could see a lot more if this
actually worked if I didn't do that in

389
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,360
fact she was going for the full network
rather than just a single isolate a

390
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,160
machine

391
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,890
but in this case we're just gonna go for
a target

392
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:41,660
she's switch over to the while

393
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,530
cool his summer start running the Mac
flooding attack and Callie to in this is

394
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,490
going to start slowing things down is
almost gonna cause a denial of service

395
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,390
because the networks the status of
flooded

396
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,039
I'm from this so here we go or just
flooding the network

397
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:02,760
WAM and then all-star surfing the web

398
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,650
cool me

399
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,770
so if this would work to work we will
star single

400
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,520
traffic popping up on the other sniffing
interface here

401
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,260
good ever really nice seeing anything
happen on this bridge interface

402
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,909
little which is to be expected because

403
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:25,360
Woodbridge is doing is a has that
forwarding table knows what I once I did

404
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,110
that but that graduates on the other
side of the bridge

405
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,000
on and if it seeing all these random act
address is popping up

406
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,559
on baseless saying i dunno relatives and
those things so what it does is it ends

407
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,370
up dropping those

408
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,980
those are packets so it'll actually
crossed that segment on

409
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,909
salt bridge mode seems to be a fairly
safe I networking

410
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,280
I think to use in a virtualized
environment so if using something like

411
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,500
Citrix XenServer using open source and

412
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,909
I highly recommend using bridge mode
while

413
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:56,360
she let's see what happens if we
actually do this and open the switch

414
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,200
environmental

415
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,200
and was

416
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,370
so again I with this is a a Gentoo Linux
machines oldest

417
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:16,130
what why and then if I do

418
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,789
well while

419
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:26,870
yes to go up to that the she cool

420
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,200
what we can see that the virtual switch
configuration here to showing all the

421
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,740
different virtual switch ports the
virtual interfaces

422
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,610
I just to show that we actually have an
open the switch configuration on the

423
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,630
system

424
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,940
I'm so over here I'm gonna go over to
the Kali 3 p.m.

425
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,230
her account cs3 Kelly be in here

426
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,740
the accident and targeting got that
first p.m.

427
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,020
I miss this host mmm

428
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:01,020
should run links on again while

429
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:06,170
while

430
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:12,790
and are on the Mac flooding attack again
little

431
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,960
Wang

432
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,150
case I did just transferred there it's a
little bit laggy because the next one is

433
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,560
working here so she start surfing a ser

434
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,660
the web Uranus may take a little bit I'm

435
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:31,660
what course is going to take a lot of
time

436
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,160
in

437
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,650
cool

438
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,730
well this one should actually work arm

439
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,470
up there it is it just it's a little bit
laggy on but we start actually seeing

440
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,880
packets going across

441
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,760
may take a little bit I'm fresh
stressing all the packets I'll

442
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,610
but we should start seeing some source
code for the for the white pages here

443
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,320
while

444
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,790
just taking a little time cause but but
as we can see that the open the switch

445
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,090
environments allowing us to actually see
the traffic across the network here

446
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,040
I'll what I can do is i'll show that the
pottery a little more

447
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,660
show the video or text you really doing
it home after this

448
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,260
little

449
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,570
says I'm just surfing the web here we're
seeing that we're seeing traffic

450
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,270
from the other machine mom on this
network

451
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:33,270
while cool

452
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,040
so was the be switched environment there
was an abrasion environments

453
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,410
enterprise-level virtual sweat you're
actually able to snap the traffic

454
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm once we start doing a Mac flooding
attack all so let's look at Citrix

455
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,790
XenServer novel

456
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:53,600
were the Citrix XenServer uses an older
version of open the switch

457
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,390
by default so good cease using a redhead
kernel here

458
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,420
while

459
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,250
so we can see that the open the switch
configuration on the system

460
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,110
while thing so in this case I'm not
going to target a single machine I'm

461
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,840
gonna what is right on the whole entire
network unless you what happens with

462
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,260
that

463
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:20,260
while

464
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:29,890
while

465
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,450
me let's see here for a little bit
before start doing links

466
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,240
mom it is a Saturday this is on the
school network there's not many people

467
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,800
there

468
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,540
on but what I'm expecting a star seeing
here is what happens

469
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,020
but I found out what happens in a Citrix
XenServer environment is just that

470
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,230
I V generate any traffic on the virtual
machine yet but I was targeting

471
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,860
but we're seeing that that the actual
Mac flooding has left a virtualized

472
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,570
environment

473
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,480
and it started to actually flood the
physical switches this is traffic

474
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,670
and the physical environment now I'm not
showing all the information to showing

475
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,800
the header information here because you
know I don't wanna show other people's

476
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,140
on traffic because that would kinda be
not legitimate on but we are actually

477
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,480
flooding the entire network now with
with packets

478
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,090
so this is an enterprise-level solution
this is the latest version of Citrix

479
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:15,800
XenServer

480
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,580
and I'm actually able to flood the
network and start going out to the

481
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,570
physical world

482
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,110
now if I go back to my art

483
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,620
makes version here we're gonna see that
the starts working but it takes a little

484
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,050
bit I'm because the lag time because I'm
flooding a network like crazy

485
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,880
I'm but eventually we should start
seeing account lead at CSIS in the IT

486
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,890
I'm DNS resolution here going to a spike
thats yes that's an 88 you which is

487
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,260
hosting my web page here

488
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,970
on there it is right there at the bottom
so we just saw the traffic from that

489
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,880
virtual machine so not only was it
effective in getting the virtual machine

490
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,190
traffic but was also effective in
getting

491
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,330
other client VM's when I first did this

492
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,730
arm I was gonna run this flooding attack
and had a couple students in the lab

493
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,780
connect to the physical switch the third
the server was connected to

494
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,840
on they were doing some lab write up the
stuff in there searching the web a

495
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,120
little bit then running attack and
obstinacy all ur

496
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,610
first %uh clapping screaming what just
happened I'll

497
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,440
and I when I looked on this cruise what
they're doing and I was sitting there

498
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,110
traffic

499
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:15,630
and the physical switch so this is kinda
scary on

500
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,520
the week actually do this cool so I
decided to text are looking in other

501
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,060
environments like by VMware and actually
hyper-v environments to see how they

502
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,050
worked on those

503
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:28,010
on different environments as well common
opossum other interesting facts based

504
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,020
upon that

505
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,470
warm killed us out here

506
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,370
3c I killed the Mac flooding but because
the delay it still kinda thrown up some

507
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,390
information here but eventually it does
stop

508
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,800
when we don't see any more information
passing through Wong

509
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:47,570
k so again what if there was a fairly
easy way for one to gain a competitive

510
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,780
edge over the other so they were in a
Citrix XenServer environment

511
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,660
or is an environment we can see that we
could sniff traffic between them in a

512
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,380
lot of these

513
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,200
of live on a DPS is they just run up you
know a regular

514
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,419
open the switch environment running on
open source and with someone its

515
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,140
distribution because it's free

516
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,650
mom something or subscribe 26 you put
your informational and the environment

517
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,820
you may be successful this kind of
attack or even if they're using Citrix

518
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,590
XenServer you may be successful this
kind of attack

519
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,870
okay so this is %uh I was actually doing
this in Cali with Dom

520
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,530
with Wireshark as well mister showing
the results the bridge interface

521
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:27,440
I'll adjusted over TCP dumping links in
this case because his lizard over ssh in

522
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,000
renal

523
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,020
location but it does work as well just
as Poland where sharks and still sleepy

524
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,300
dump is just a command-line version
Wireshark

525
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,390
also the bridge information we see
nothing really happens here

526
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,640
but if we do this without open the
switch in this case was to rise or 90

527
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,010
we see I was able to sniff all that
traffic on as I was actually

528
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,440
running the attack

529
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,900
so stable shows on the other virus
attack saddam we can see that

530
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,330
on lennox bridging is not vulnerable so
if you're running a Citrix XenServer

531
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,790
environment

532
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:01,140
my eye recommendation is put into bridge
mode

533
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,990
you can do that and Citrix land on they
do allow its defaulted to open the

534
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,770
switch but you can go to the
configuration changed over bridge

535
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,570
environment

536
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:13,250
which prevent this kind of attack I'm
receiver anything using open the switch

537
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,850
is vulnerable to two packets nothing com
if you do the next morning attack

538
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,720
on Microsoft hyper-v I try to on both
but the Windows Server 2003 full

539
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,610
addition

540
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,070
I'm as well as dr. paper the Free
Edition and I found this was 2008

541
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,470
I thought that was intolerable it wasn't
because the piece which

542
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,020
it's because I'm Microsoft 2008 server
has built-in protection against Mac

543
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,890
spoofing

544
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,530
I meant for some reason that helps
against this kind of attack because

545
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,370
we're just basically splitting a whole
buncha random act addresses

546
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:44,590
and server 2008 protects against that go
Microsoft for one thing right

547
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,970
I'm the so

548
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,980
it seems like a better environment this
kind of a case

549
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,570
are then using open the switch but
performance wise say

550
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,540
happened after I can't really talk about
it artifacts what happened in VMware

551
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,669
because the end-user license agreement
prevents

552
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:04,560
on for talking about the performance
error testing on based upon that must

553
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,980
get written consent from them which I
did not get

554
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,550
but I will say that Microsoft did base
their environment heavily upon VMware

555
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,510
soul

556
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:17,540
take it as you well tested on your own
issue which think arming

557
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,880
what was that again young are

558
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,070
I haven't tested with the shield running
in the environment yeah I just tested on

559
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,500
the basic I'm default ESXi configuration

560
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,580
on but that's a good point that's that's
something I should look into thank you

561
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,419
for that

562
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:37,440
cool so in conclusion all where to voter
boys discuss your targeted towards the

563
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,179
virtual networking platforms and not the
hypervisors themselves it's important to

564
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,490
recognize here because

565
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,860
I'm not targeting hypervisors I'm just
starting the actual networking

566
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,220
on this going on there the results show
that the virtual networking devices can

567
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,960
be just as vulnerable to the sex
attackers the finish physical

568
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,120
counterparts

569
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,450
arm so further for the research is going
to be looking at these other taxi talked

570
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,200
about the beginning here without you and
hopping in our school thing in

571
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,260
DHCP attacks on as I go down the line
but for right now I was just looking at

572
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,400
the Max legacy for was feasible to
actually progress onto looking at this

573
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,710
information

574
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:13,800
I'll Suzanne server and other solutions
using open peace which are vulnerable

575
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,830
onto the box

576
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:19,620
default configuration on its kinda scary
so if your network administrator out

577
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,270
there are you putting the senate's
things and just blindly

578
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,679
on display you're trusting that they've
they've taken care the stuff your kind

579
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,030
of

580
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,050
you're looking at a false hopes the
issue really look at tight in these

581
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,750
things up a little more maybe look at
deploying some things a little more

582
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,840
secure

583
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,190
on the just using something is open the
switch we can also look at maybe using

584
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,960
something like software-defined
networking open the switch does

585
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,720
allow for that collectivity on where we
catch start defining certain flows and

586
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,140
specific clothes and filtering traffic
based on certain characteristics

587
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,230
start you know preventing this kind of
activity from occurring

588
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,649
I'm but not everybody is really well
first I suffered a fine networking

589
00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:57,040
on in a lot of people just accept that
default configuration

590
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,140
cool so single malicious virtual machine
as a potential snow all traffic passing

591
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,960
across a virtual switch

592
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,780
I'm and as wish as I showed this can
actually pass through the actual virtual

593
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,690
environment and and affect the physical
network as well

594
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,679
estar daisy chaining down the line to
all the uplinks taking on off switches

595
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,280
which interprets the view and separation
as well as we saw traffic that was not

596
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,720
I'm

597
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,240
died isolated virtual and that my our
server was on a certain scene traffic

598
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,470
from other virtual environments as well

599
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,030
on sis is a significant threat to the
CIA have any information passing over

600
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,669
that virtualized network

601
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:36,409
in so I'd like to think of you people
for for this work oMG my PhD advisor

602
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:39,630
i'm nick moretti was here's why with his
%uh see it poi-dog

603
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,860
soon advanced they gave me a lot of our
equipment Rackspace's stopped using a

604
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,649
lot better kinda wreak havoc on the
network

605
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:50,100
to this research I'm have a close to
research lab assistants do along again

606
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,590
spear

607
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,750
which help we can set up this
environment I'm

608
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,940
my department chair Chris Irvine which
got me funding for some love the idea

609
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,570
could be in for some suffer using

610
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,980
odd city Polytechnic Research Foundation
after finding some in this research

611
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,590
as well see polly and cs5 was kinda here
in strength to support the stock for me

612
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,610
today

613
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:13,169
so with that any questions and share
this: she questions in the audience here

614
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:16,860
best here me

615
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,919
yes order

616
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,530
better thing

617
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,350
go so hard were based virtual interfaces
using

618
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:32,640
who were s so the question was at what
was question can I couldn't hear the

619
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,710
first part

620
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,149
good here while

621
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:43,220
here good

622
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,750
okay so was the question was SR already
if I can actually virtualize the current

623
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,760
affairs factor

624
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,919
wing yeah I haven't done anything with
that right now but that's something I

625
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,620
will look into

626
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,149
thank you for that on any other
questions I'll

627
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:59,950
yes

628
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,290
head

629
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,480
I'll yeah I talked about
brick-and-mortar

630
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,990
I'm so it's ok you're talking about the
Bucs about commercial arm

631
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,090
data centers or just commercialize PBS's

632
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,679
yes commercial I haven't asked this on
Amazon ec2 any those other

633
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,190
commercialized environments

634
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,120
on but if they're using open the switch
in their environment and they're doing

635
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,540
default configuration

636
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,929
I think they're gonna be vulnerable but
mostly the summer those bigger companies

637
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:28,510
are taking other precautions like maybe
they're using other higher layer

638
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,520
appliances

639
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,630
a fortress kind of traffic on to prevent
that maybe these insulin OpenStack which

640
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,880
does use St and actually create flows

641
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,080
I'm so they can actually prevent summers
attack from occurring on

642
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,200
but I haven't actually taking this out
to that to the cloud at which I to do

643
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,700
intend to do eventually

644
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,800
on but I know what Amazon ec2 you need
to actually

645
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,510
talk to them about what you gonna do
under fire you can just are contesting

646
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,880
the environment and the blue

647
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,669
on the guy can to get the permission to
do something like that I'll

648
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:58,700
so that's something I do intend to look
into anything else

649
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,850
in at the questions

650
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,179
cool while

651
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:06,610
okay well thank you all
