1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:03,500
okay so I before I get started real last
year

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,259
I you know course up for those in our
minds benten

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,580
and last year I spoke in the main track

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,610
and another first the first track and

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,770
jokingly ahead a time Nick said hey do
you need a box

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,720
to stand on its peak the funny thing was
that the body was actually up here and I

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,010
needed a box that they had to speak at

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,670
cell I welcomed and welcomed about
perfect let him

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,180
what a practical PowerShell programming
for professional people I

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,370
the slides ran slight shared it banned

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,660
10:00 alexei alright so that we can get
'em

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,660
I had a time if you want to follow along
her afterwards that link

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,629
is twice more in this Dexia be able to
find that and get that from there

14
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,210
us a little about me it's not been
knocks at

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,110
its 10 and no I'm not the cartoon
network one

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,090
I'd don't like to getting the cease and
desist for that and vice president

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,010
security officer and a developer

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,280
I created their a sec framework and a
gamer nerd geek

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,390
and you're gonna see that as we go to
the stock before we get started though I

20
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,430
its kinda becoming an annual tradition I
created a contest to win a free ticket

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,240
to Derby Conn

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,159
and so this year I said what I want to
do is find a picture of me somewhere

23
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,490
and Photoshop me into an animal into a
picture and you get wayne's

24
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:25,470
if you can in a gay science fiction if
you can integrate somehow the time

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,110
social engineering somebody

26
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,680
or make fun of the fact that I look like
a child and

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,970
people delivered and

28
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:39,159
I so here's a first one not sure best

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,290
in then all you did was connected jumper
cables to the Stargate now you're just

31
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,770
typing hack hack hack hack hack over and
over again

32
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,439
for nuclear reactor benítez fail

33
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,939
that was from Norway by the way Nigeria

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,950
at that's johnnie christmases had

37
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,629
for a will get visitors bad right after
I'm 18 gold

38
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,900
in the data center for hours later and

39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,890
I don't really know computers but I
noticed black cyber attack vectors

40
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,050
looks like johnnie chris is this is
Johnny christmases head so

41
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,030
this is how to get girls rooms keys
fucked

42
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:44,030
new blinky box never felt more secure do
girl geez in streetman

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,000
those are not the droids you're looking
for now this tasseled

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,280
not only put me in a baby carrier but
they come and C three BL

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,190
don't

46
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:05,489
fucking jerk and the winner was that I
lost in space they put me on the little

47
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:06,220
kids head

48
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,480
social engineer the way and that lost in
space said so that was bad says she did

49
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,800
she did that

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,849
diet Christmas everybody Johnny where
you're a fan johnnie

51
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:22,849
he did he did most the voters have an
active in their hands okay so seriously

52
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,519
I have 75 minutes where the pan Ted

53
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,390
and I'm going to burn through so many
interest after really quick because I

54
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,810
want to get to the point where you guys
actually see

55
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,310
center development and I i want you guys
to

56
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,750
too cold rain along with me you brought
your laptop get it out and we're gonna

57
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,120
go through we're gonna do each things as
we get along

58
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,640
the intent to this talk is not to be
that I'm I'm gonna focus on how do you

59
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,830
automate everything you have in your
buyer meant I want you walk out here

60
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,310
with an understanding a powershell

61
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,159
to the you can grow beyond that to talk
about just a quick overview of the

62
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,480
language is in development

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,650
we're gonna give rate in the PowerShell
scripting we will have a script that you

64
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,459
can use in your environment

65
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,099
rate after this so we'll talk about some
resources some

66
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:08,349
Q&A and this is mostly live coding now

67
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,159
before we get started feel free to
interrupt

68
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,709
however we on a time schedule so feel
free after questions

69
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:19,780
if you ask me a non asinine question

70
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,070
I had drink tokens for tonight arty

71
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,410
okay so I will give these to you if you
ask me a good

72
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,540
question any not it's not theirs and
stupid as shit

73
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,290
a good one an asinine one so I assets
Dickerson X you guys coming at those

74
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,460
after we're done as well

75
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,570
okay all right let's get going so
quickly we're gonna go over

76
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,650
set styles including syntax how to get
help

77
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,389
and starting out before I get going
raise your hand if you've never skip to

78
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,910
be four key measure and place

79
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,759
okay what about I what if you think that
you are a

80
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,620
it about a novice level scripture right
now can you as a hand

81
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,960
okay what would you say if you're an
intermediate level skip to raise your

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,180
hand

83
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,690
okay so that so wouldn't that this is
the right target audience for what we're

84
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,910
trying to do today

85
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,720
on how to get help starting out so there
are styles and coatings

86
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,130
there's the novice who is you know never
done it before whatever the case review

87
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,139
you gotta admit scripture who's created
a few things but

88
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:20,580
they really haven't done much you got
your full time developer who

89
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,710
I'm can develop programs in right things
if need be and then you get your code

90
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,940
monkeys

91
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,940
need to the guys are just part outcode
nonstop

92
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,550
so I'm a code monkey I've been doing it
since I was 14 so like last year

93
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,850
and in cell

94
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,020
I love coding a it's it's I once I got a
whole again I could tell a computer what

95
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,660
to do

96
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,199
I got addicted with it so this is what I
do I develop

97
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,360
all the time I love writing things I
love learning languages except COBOL

98
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,729
he called all yeah me too many

99
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,780
certain this is about where we're
heading in this talk

100
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,500
its a rating between the novice in the
added scripter okay so I'm gonna quickly

101
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,930
go over some stuff

102
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,340
but I encourage you to go out and get
the other resources so you can learn a

103
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,940
bit more

104
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,120
so syntax I for those who don't know
it's the rules that govern how a script

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,970
or program is developing a given
language

106
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,039
whenever I learn a new language I have
to understand the syntax

107
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,560
it's like it it's using the same words
but using a different way

108
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,210
it's kinda like you know going down
south I i know you're speaking English

109
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,039
may have no idea what you're saying

110
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,960
and sorry Adrian her Martin

111
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,330
there are things that help with syntax
white space

112
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,500
Brent the Seas commas periods quotes
tabs braces

113
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,190
curly brackets call in semi colons they
all play an integral part

114
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,289
innocent XI language and a lot of times
this is where most

115
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:49,840
not the Scriptures mess-up they use
things incorrectly or the skit something

116
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
from Stack Overflow

117
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,630
they copy and paste and they can't
figure out how to get it to work

118
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,479
you have to understand the syntax for
the language if you hope to use it

119
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:04,250
so how do we get help we want to do that
well it really is read epping manual I

120
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,919
mean

121
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,090
that's what it boils down to: if you
want to understand how to the computer

122
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,050
how to do something you have to clear

123
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,860
figure out how to get the hell now you
can do that through the documentation in

124
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,650
the reference

125
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,449
but that's not always true because how
many actual developers we have in here

126
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,970
do we love documentation did yeah you're
a liar

127
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,330
I we hate documentation

128
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,500
we hate writing and I i love cranking up
the code but I don't like telling other

129
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,539
people how to use it

130
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:37,550
so not so the docking station is not
always the right resource

131
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,009
on there's interactive help that you can
get you can use a question mark F one

132
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,129
in the PowerShell ISEE there's

133
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,560
there's intellisense which is
auto-completion at your command see you

134
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,770
can handle on what that

135
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,039
but our show has a command get hyphen
help

136
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,810
okay PowerShell is very bitter noun

137
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,349
okay it's very good and take an asinine
I thought it

138
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:03,650
and then Matt Johnson beat me so

139
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,410
get help that search engines great
mutual utility

140
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,430
I know you guys love the girls and
everything but I hate to Google's I'm a

141
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,990
duck that growth and Epico

142
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,740
a yep Duck Duck Go is so much better in
my opinion at least from the developer

143
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,580
standpoint

144
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,610
because they need to get rid of all the
fluff and Bopanna go straight to the

145
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,169
resources that you need and you here's a
here's an example just

146
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,460
PowerShell get help the first three
items that gives you are Stack Overflow

147
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,819
things

148
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:32,190
and it's really straight there and
report so and

149
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,700
it's what Google was back in 1998 and
that we really why I have moved back

150
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,649
over to them

151
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,849
sup anyways use those on

152
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,380
speaking at that anyone know jimmy vo
your

153
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,490
so he wanted to be in people in many
decks as possible

154
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,290
so I decided I would Adams my deck
sacred to clone

155
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,390
do sec anyways and what the heck

156
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,720
I so what is PowerShell PowerShell the
task automation and configuration

157
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,860
management framework for Microsoft

158
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,250
a consistent command line shell and
associates Group scripting language

159
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,779
built on the dotnet framework

160
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,640
so if you know see sharper a speedo
network TV dotnet you actually are one

161
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,529
step ahead of most people who are taking
a partial for the first time

162
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:17,700
because it builds on dot net directly
mystery by Jeffrey Snover

163
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,600
Bruce my at James sure and Hwy initial
release was November 14 2006

164
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,180
around for a long time it's only
recently began a pickup pickup

165
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,620
popularity over the last couple years

166
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,260
especially when you see people like I'm
it and might bear

167
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,680
draft putting it in Global Strike and
yet how exploit need a parsec not an

168
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,980
it it's really becoming a great way but
to not only maintain your systems but

169
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,040
also to do attack and defence

170
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,459
PowerShell for the Windows Management
Framework WM F 5.0 was released April 30

171
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:51,440
this year

172
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,120
and when we talk about anything that
we're not going to be doing today

173
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,959
we're targeting the 3.0 I'm I found that
3.0 is the most widely adopted an urgent

174
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:00,670
right now

175
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,019
and you find some followers around but
three is really a good place to read it

176
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:04,820
has to start

177
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,440
if you're ever going to be doing a few
scripts especially p.m. XP still on your

178
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,459
payments if you do

179
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:16,190
get him off so dick the entire show you
need to be in a 3.0 you in dotnet 4.5

180
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,540
attack set up your choice if this is
your first time scripting stick with

181
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,920
harsh lise

182
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,820
its gonna help you it really is it's
gonna complete things for you is going

183
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,300
to highlight things are going up with
the curly bracket to need

184
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,410
so that will help you a good just got
better me personally I use sublime taxed

185
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,329
and just because I like the editor I
think it's really good and so

186
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,950
a komodo Edit also good one both sublime
and Comodo have

187
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,990
I highlighted highlighting for
PowerShell in there so

188
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,440
abt emerged you choose whatever one you
like but if this is your first time

189
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,709
stick with that I S E

190
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:49,930
I personally think the ISA is bloated
and too big of a friend

191
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,250
so with PowerShell has different file
extensions it PS one for script files PS

192
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,760
and one for script module files PSD one
for script manifest files

193
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,170
the s1 XML performing a type files and
then the deal allows the command line

194
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,240
providers and lease

195
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,440
don't worry we're only focusing on the
PS once okay

196
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,269
but it's important that you know this is
because each files a little bit

197
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,980
different in with the way interaction a
partial environment your

198
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,120
so we have commandments functions and
scripts a few

199
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,209
from a functional standpoint they're the
same thing it's just the way the how you

200
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,610
could hold the script that you're
creating

201
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,810
and at-bats computed run the file

202
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,860
I so that it would be like a script file
but if you have functions you can

203
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,029
actually make your program flow change

204
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:36,279
and you can go to the capital out Obama
found another file doesn't really matter

205
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,399
it's just a way to call the code that
you wrote

206
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,810
suck a manly is actually come hi old
okay

207
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,630
it's compiled in the dotnet language is
very easy to deploy

208
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,660
the hell Plaza easier to write and has
support for parameter validation so you

209
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,380
can actually going to see chard

210
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,240
and create a PowerShell command line so
you have the full done at library

211
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,500
available to you

212
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,110
a function is written in the PowerShell
language it has to be deployed with

213
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:06,040
a library meaning it has to be with the
automation that DLL file

214
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,380
help is written inside the function
predator validation has to be done

215
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,380
in the function itself and then the
script

216
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,720
this is where we're camping today script
is written in the PowerShell language

217
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,750
it's invoked by calling the ps1 file to
play itself I manifest or in a man fell

218
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,470
set by

219
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,870
by itself by file and can contain
functions

220
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,510
now this reason I'm camping here is once
the easiest to do

221
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,980
simplistic up and mir's the batch
scripting that a lot of us have already

222
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,779
done

223
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:35,079
okay before you get started

224
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,709
the set execution policy if you want to
use any the scripts that you're writing

225
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,220
you need to change this

226
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,620
its defaulted to restricted which means
only the signed

227
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,220
PS 1 files that you get will be able to
run

228
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,920
now there's another option to where you
can set the execution out

229
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,600
that policy to you 9 I believe

230
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,970
and don't do that that's very bad so
that it's a remote site

231
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,899
okay so there's this is just kinda looks
like when you do that

232
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,269
it'll ask if you wanna do it is cheesy
ass and the mobile on

233
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,660
alright so another that and before a
game

234
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,720
continuing further I've not read any
books

235
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,760
and any language ever learnt I I just
never done and never done it

236
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,920
and I don't learn bucks I don't learn it
that way I just want to get it out

237
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,200
and just are breaking breaking things
just so I can see what I can do.

238
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,130
so for me I'd rather just die right and
and so that's what we're gonna start

239
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,320
right now

240
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,470
so let's create a hello world program
that's it the simplest places are you

241
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,860
never done any type of coating
whatsoever

242
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,920
acton

243
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,279
yeah ass alright

244
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,139
so good so here's our hello world at ps1

245
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:51,949
and its just this simple to get hello
world to show up on the screen

246
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:55,230
we're gonna do it's a member to burn
down such right

247
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:02,230
a bit knows a color changed and i'm
looking up but some text in a ring

248
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,769
it's just that simple now there is
another way to get

249
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:09,529
information to go to the screen is
called write-host if you use right post

250
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:13,250
simultaneously a kitten puppy and it all
died

251
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,190
a and for

252
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,110
can tell you is Right host okay he's
right out but she is Right host

253
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,880
don't tell you what don't own you wanna
PowerShell for me alright so

254
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,839
split come over here and if I look in my
director here I can see I got my hello

255
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,019
world at ps1 pile

256
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,540
so to it to initiate it I just cant
excellent add

257
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,160
and you notice it was the dot slash if
you want to run the script that's how

258
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,870
you do it

259
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,339
or you can just you to tap complete so
they press Enter

260
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:48,870
hello to be can you a hidden

261
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,910
I for those either they just did that
congratulations you wrote your first

262
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,269
martians K

263
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:58,380
its Ron slight you get a look at the
pictures me again

264
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,100
let's go back to this and thank you and

265
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,920
shift at five then shipped abroad nice
area hello world a

266
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,209
you're doing a great job everybody false
you're doing a great job

267
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,649
alright so that's great you get
information out to the streets and

268
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,579
alleys do something with the variables a
variable

269
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,639
is a symbolic name that you referenced
in your application

270
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,380
that has an associated with the value
whose value can be changed

271
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,339
different in a constant hence the name
constant constantly meaning the same

272
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:31,339
to the variable you can actually put
something in there and mess around with

273
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:33,120
it

274
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,449
the when we talk about the term
hardcoded the hello world

275
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:41,649
was hardcoded mean we didn't assign it
to a variable we put the string directly

276
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,709
into our script

277
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,149
so partial variables are defined by a
dollar sign followed by the name that

278
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:49,790
you want a reference so for example
dollar sign message

279
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,279
is a variable so let's rewrite hello
world he is a variable

280
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,620
so i connect over here and I'll stay

281
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,980
message eager to you who dare that got
him

282
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,500
and now I would do right post to kill a
kitten

283
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,720
out but my message me

284
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,889
with it so far yes there's like to be a
great read

285
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:19,800
and there you go still works exactly the
same acceptable we've done is we've just

286
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,610
but the message into a variable so we
can mess around with inducing

287
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,820
later so let's look at that so quick

288
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:34,820
but I did this

289
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,839
good he gets was going to happen

290
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,380
Matt don't answer thing

291
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,660
that no puppies die in the making of
this cat your

292
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,100
yeah 20 things to happen yet said

293
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:57,160
what all yep OKC thinking about me ill
be out with no space okay so I see that

294
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,350
string

295
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:06,000
who happen

296
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,490
really put it all on one line we only
ask for right now but once

297
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:16,179
yet so this is this is important part in
this is something that can catch a lot

298
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:17,610
of people off guard

299
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,049
so this this is where

300
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:24,100
quotes come into play okay

301
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,049
quotes are very specific in this
language whereas in other languages you

302
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,600
can use a single in a double ko
interchangeably in nothing no one's

303
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,360
gonna care

304
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,330
in this language it matters a double
quote will attempt to resolve

305
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,760
any of the variables before it's printed
so in message wine we have hello

306
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,690
before try to print out its gonna pull
the value that inside at variable

307
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,789
we as a single quote will print exactly
what is between the two single quotes

308
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:53,590
so let's take a look at that and see
what this looks like so now I can hear

309
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,690
and I put the double quotes around it
did you must know something here

310
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,950
this you know the color honor so the
same

311
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:07,289
even not between quoted as a string so I
can hear

312
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:12,960
now it works but if I come over here

313
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,610
the what you get another dollar sank
handled

314
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,049
your a change to change color so now an
eight-run this

315
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:24,590
it shows exactly what's there don't get
hung up on their

316
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,760
double and single quotes do not operate
the same

317
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,480
K yes we think it to be good

318
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,120
so what if we want specific characters
like the dollar sign to be printed or

319
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,280
whatever the case maybe that's where you
come in with the back deck

320
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,240
the tactic or is also called the Great
accent is a special a skate character

321
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,380
this means you want the next care to be
printed exactly and not interpret it

322
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,500
anyway

323
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,870
so let's say I wanted to display what my
values were

324
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,150
in between these two guys this is good
for debugging

325
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,520
so I wanna say message one is able to
whatever the value is so I lecture to a

326
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,950
back deck

327
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:03,789
now say message wine is equal to that s

328
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:07,210
and back tech message

329
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:12,340
to is equal to this see the difference
in the color here

330
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,400
that means it's going to display the
dollar sign in which means now it's not

331
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,320
gonna look at it as though it's a
variable

332
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,340
so if I run this am

333
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,650
you message one is it a hello message
she was able to recount

334
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,240
this is great for debugging if you wanna
stay with the values of these things are

335
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,760
you wanna show that on the screen

336
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,049
this is a great way for me to do that so
that back tick character special

337
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:38,890
it's also good for when you want to
actually display a dollar sign

338
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,960
all rights we showed you that good to
write output is great

339
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,000
is right how to host a good idea no now
now but how to get information from the

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,340
user to read host

341
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,400
and this is y la tabla soon to use
write-host

342
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,500
and but don't use write-host seriously

343
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,870
and did they die they really do and true
story

344
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,500
so let's get some information from the
user

345
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,340
so I might come back here MSA message is
equal to

346
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,789
and share your name now

347
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:13,429
whatever I get from the user I wanna
store in my variable some nice a name

348
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:17,940
is eager to read post

349
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,900
message night very hard coded the
message in there but

350
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,470
just for example and I want to do is
also right output

351
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,600
do name

352
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,909
me with a day like going to pass a good

353
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:40,200
so let's see what happens when you tap
good

354
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,340
enter my name dude in monoxide

355
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,450
tupelo an accent re-air

356
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:51,049
net the simplest way to do it I'm not
going to camp too long here just give me

357
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,360
a lot i cant undercover

358
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,230
alright waited to conditional logics now

359
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,330
so a conditional logic is a feature a
programming language which reform a

360
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,169
different set up computations are
actions

361
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:06,030
okay you know I hate this definition its
a decision

362
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:10,630
and you make you look at a condition he
say if this about evaluates to true

363
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,900
do this if it doesn't do this they got
back from chicago something is a

364
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,159
stoplight example if the lights green
keep going

365
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:21,179
at the light red stopped at the light is
yellow fluorescent run over pedestrians

366
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:27,100
in okay that's conditional logic rate
there you make that decision

367
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,419
so the way that we do then our shells
using the if the else

368
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,669
the else if and is also a switch the
switch will evaluate multiple conditions

369
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,260
at the same time

370
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,320
it won't use the a single line at once
it'll actually do multiple

371
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,770
if is what we're gonna start for what
we're learning today

372
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,030
this is the most asinine thing a partial
has done

373
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,260
instead of using that at for the pipe
they have to do these

374
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,549
asinine hitman and in hype and or

375
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:00,549
of it's asinine matchup a

376
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:05,100
it's hot it's totally asinine because
you know they've even C sharp doesn't

377
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,870
have to deal with this stupid stuff but
anyways the way you do is hyphen and

378
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,450
and I can or I did this talking convert
to converge and I did

379
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,340
I'm did at instead the and and

380
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,750
my script bombed so anyways it hyphen
and hype in order

381
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,760
and then there's also equals less than
greater than

382
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,440
not equal greater than or equal or less
than equal

383
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,429
you guys can download these lies to pull
this out so it is gonna burn through it

384
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:31,650
all right

385
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,210
like not like match not match contains
many different operations that you guys

386
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,210
can use so that

387
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,429
go look at those so let's see in
waterscape look like if we entered in

388
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:42,150
some conditional

389
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,460
I logic here solely this the same and
I'll say

390
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,760
if name his equal to:

391
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,970
in benten I wanna different message than
normally

392
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,799
so I'm essay right poet

393
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,530
Mac guy Sox certification

394
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:06,470
be and then we'll put this guy back up
here

395
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,539
okay so this is my conditional logic

396
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,850
this is basically saying I want you to
do you

397
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,190
this line right here if this condition
evaluates to TRUE if it doesn't then go

398
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,860
do this one

399
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,600
so let's take a look and see if I skip
works

400
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,850
and remaining band k so worked

401
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,429
it was it wasn't Ben 10 so I got their
ballot message

402
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:32,390
if I put and 10 there you go

403
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,390
so there's a person a conditional logics
that basically we can begin to you

404
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,390
make decisions of the day and date
information that we have

405
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:44,880
packed keep going up from this

406
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,049
how many guys have ever been hung up an
operator presidents

407
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:52,559
developers yeah there should be more you
guys raise your hands because this

408
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,390
this message people up so or bad

409
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,700
case operator precedence in PowerShell
works left

410
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,740
to write when you when you're looking at
the conditional logic

411
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,350
it's gonna work left to right except on
your neck Asian operators

412
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,730
not or binary not okay then it works

413
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:18,299
right to lapd there are ways to override
this and that's by enclosing things in a

414
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,600
prendere see

415
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,730
and that way it's just like math
whatever's in a friend to see you do

416
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,120
that

417
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,360
first then you do everything else got at

418
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,600
get so let's let's write 8 situation to
where are conditional logic will

419
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,929
actually give us

420
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,140
incorrect output me okay

421
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,190
so I do this when I say as security gate

422
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,130
equals read host and share your security

423
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,150
group okay now

424
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,470
what I want to do is if the name is Ben
10

425
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,150
and the security group is equal to burbs
sec

426
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,140
so say and slick CITY to get adjusted

427
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,059
over asinine

428
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:09,100
okay and the name is Ben 10 then do that
guy Sox

429
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,130
your border

430
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,190
if the security group in

431
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,770
is equal to deep am that scare Tomic's
everybody

432
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,230
luvin year church

433
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,059
and but are sorry this should be my sack

434
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,559
young and

435
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,750
name is equal to determine

436
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,980
K so the condition they go back I know
this is big sponsor everything runs off

437
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,059
if the scare you his per sec and Ben 10

438
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,840
or its my sec nd time

439
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,490
then put that guy Sox otherwise write
the name

440
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,039
how do you guys think this is gonna be
successful should be because I just told

441
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,240
you a right when it was gonna fail

442
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,450
Jan so let's write assessed at if I put

443
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,809
band and Derby in

444
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:07,490
K works fine if I do band 10

445
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,070
and Irving it works fine

446
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,080
because again its members benten and per
sec what if idea

447
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,020
D Tom and my sec

448
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,730
okay that works of art up

449
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:30,730
hold on let's see this one in

450
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:37,480
it failed a in the condition logic said
if it ben ten and burps Akkad

451
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,690
then display our first message and
that's what it says are here if security

452
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,070
group because their sector

453
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,120
but remember it works left to write

454
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,950
so it evaluated after this or

455
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,260
it evaluated these conditions that's why
D Tom words

456
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,100
and Ben 10 didn't its all about operator
precedence

457
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,880
so to fix this we put it around this
group

458
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,320
here but parentheses

459
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,400
order Sheree

460
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,539
and now I'm changing the operator
precedence this conditional logic so

461
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,659
they can work the way I want to work

462
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:18,740
so let's see if this works now in

463
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,000
the

464
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,630
their young make sense

465
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,770
good don't get hung up on a guy's
alright

466
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,669
operators got a conditional logic but
%uh parameters trailers are variables

467
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:33,909
that allow you to pass

468
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:36,750
and object to command that function or
script this is how you can take

469
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,140
information from another scripture from
another

470
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,419
world antacid into the PowerShell
function modular script

471
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:47,419
so let's take a look at get child item
which is a cool I little commandment

472
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:48,590
that was written by

473
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:52,480
that day comes native Sophie to get
child item

474
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,669
and it'll actually display the files are
on my system ignore the donkey porn

475
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:02,320
and hang that's normal I guess and so
this will display all the things that

476
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:02,950
are on there

477
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,429
if we look at the get help forget child
item on the clear

478
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:11,610
that we're not talking about asking

479
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:15,120
okay it basically displays everything is
going on

480
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,640
and i cant im heiress very go

481
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,460
so I just played everything and you can
be scrawny is to type it tells you

482
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,250
exactly how to use it

483
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,130
all those hyphens are that parameters
this is how you can pass tough to it

484
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,870
so as you can see that we have a we have
a high pain path so let's go ahead and

485
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,340
do to get Twilight again

486
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,970
and what specify a path and was taken to
a different directory

487
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,140
okay so those are parameters and based
on what you do is how you can interact

488
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,080
with that script

489
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,020
I'm so when you're looking at that when
you're looking at how to utilize when

490
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,179
the commandos are functions make sure
you understand

491
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:57,700
what all the printers are so you can
interact with it that's efficiently

492
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,120
the should all that now

493
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:08,720
PowerShell is object based just because
it displaced text on the screen

494
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,250
doesn't mean you're interacting with the
strain and even a strain

495
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,789
is an object this is very difficult for
a lot of people understand

496
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:22,909
and dayy on a necklace units text on the
screen and that means that a string

497
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:27,450
snatch that's not the case everything
that's return is returning is returning

498
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,539
as a string and less

499
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:32,929
you explicitly saying and right as a
string

500
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:37,899
okay but even a string as an object so
let's take a look at something here

501
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:42,480
if I do get child item

502
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,720
analyst at the path so sad eating a
partial screen

503
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,330
the okay so this is a similar help but
that we've seen from command prompt and

504
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,399
everything else like that

505
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,980
we got node last write time like the
name what school

506
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,309
is that I can reference did any one of
these columns

507
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:03,909
so I can actually say if I say files

508
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:07,029
equals get child lying down path

509
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:12,429
CPS at okay so all my stuff is here in
files now

510
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:16,799
I can actually just say file stat name
in

511
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,169
and I can access all sorts a different
formation

512
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:24,919
may suffer that because it's an object
which makes which allows you to do great

513
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:25,950
things and wonderful

514
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:31,360
powerful things just by accessing that
object now

515
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,760
so piping biting as away from New

516
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,299
moving something unchanged from one
place to another

517
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:41,880
I so it's pipe is represented by the
pipe character and

518
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,059
it takes the object from the left side
and moved to the right

519
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:49,289
when it's on the right side of the pipe
the way that you reference the object

520
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,330
that was passed is with dollar sign

521
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:55,520
underscore that as a reserve variable
named you can't use dollar sign

522
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,649
underscore for your variables

523
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:00,740
and that is specifically for piping so
let's take a look at this

524
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,799
good so I say

525
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:08,700
get child I am bath PS at

526
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,559
went up take me the files object that
which created

527
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,149
am in a senate over to where object

528
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:20,309
and I but put it this is my logic brace
brackets now

529
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:25,029
MSA Wayne this is how I referenced the
object was passed

530
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:28,480
the name is equal to locks

531
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,899
you got it an area

532
00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:36,279
good said that's how you can haz that
information over

533
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,720
everyone day Kennedy decade everybody
here

534
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,130
yeah

535
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,299
him turn get object GTF

536
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:51,899
old I

537
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:55,070
ship alright so that's piping

538
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,690
how much and I you know how it where I
missing I can get that 20 minutes

539
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:04,409
when it Louis looks our way to perform
the same block a code for specific

540
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:07,840
number of times until a statistic
condition is met for a while a specific

541
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,779
condition exists

542
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:13,450
so there are many ways to represent
loops for each for each object for a

543
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,059
while deal

544
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,090
until and whatever I'm just gonna show
you a for each loop

545
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,190
this is where you gonna go back and
deliver it more research on how to build

546
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,320
each of these looks when you're dealing
with your thing

547
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,370
each of them isn't is is using a
specific instance

548
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,409
you're not going always four each
everything because

549
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:32,049
there may not be at and a specific
number items that you can you say you

550
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:34,500
may want to use a while or until

551
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,029
or whatever the case may be so let's go
ahead and look it up for each

552
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:42,789
to here's a loop so we're gonna use a
similar I'll

553
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:46,500
thing that we just dead but instead of
me piping that file over to a

554
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,659
conditional unless a polar

555
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:52,240
each object which is a built-in

556
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,429
this is what I wanted to do for each one
of those file objects that I get

557
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:00,210
I want you to write in you are such a
church

558
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:05,750
do

559
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,210
good where

560
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,130
the hairs on the back way that question
I

561
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,320
okay alright so right output

562
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,470
home pad she done

563
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,840
wheelabrator as creepy did action

564
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,409
you know he had like I've light and
flashlight his pocket to man

565
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:33,490
could that's going on the Internet

566
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:36,789
do to write output

567
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:41,880
I'm a reference that am I just gonna
reference the variable that in there

568
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,519
now understand there's many ways to do
exactly what I just did

569
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:50,840
and it's showing you what a loop dies
rate I'm not trying to

570
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,840
I yes you could you get child item where
name

571
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,549
it was this and filter out on the just
the name

572
00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:01,669
and and field that goes along with that

573
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:05,450
I'm just six to eight showing you what
you can do so you can come back here and

574
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,620
you could say

575
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,960
right output good file name:

576
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,750
is equal two years ago

577
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,879
and then I'm gonna but this guy in this
in

578
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,260
okay now that you can see what I just
did with the with their brackets

579
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,119
with their printers here okay the reason
I did this

580
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:34,260
is to make sure that it interprets that
as an actual name and not the word name

581
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,520
so there you go see you can see it's
more than just that I actually modified

582
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,879
the content of that name before I
display it to the screen

583
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,260
you think a get excite this one

584
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,780
if that doing it

585
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,560
okay comments quickly comments are
amazing

586
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,200
with developers especially could look as
we hate them kept running

587
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,869
comments in the code because we know
what we're doing and screw everyone else

588
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:03,460
and I don't know what I'd I've been
written it went back to my code that was

589
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,700
like five years ago when I was three

590
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,760
and done I have no idea what I did

591
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,099
have no idea why I did it was horrible
and so on

592
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:16,240
comments are defined you can just use
the pound sign

593
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,190
but if you want to block on it you can
use the less than a greater than for the

594
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,050
comments

595
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,750
and it kinda looks like this I S let's
go ahead and do a quick comment for a

596
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,320
file

597
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,530
so I come back up here in

598
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:32,200
and you know everything change color
sana but this

599
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,040
like this national cannot lock at the
top

600
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,849
now there are things that you can use to
reference that they are

601
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:43,650
go back a synopsis description parameter
example

602
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,750
these are the most popular once there
are more but these are the most popular

603
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,170
ones that you can use

604
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:52,619
and so I come back over here I can say
dat synopsis

605
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:56,570
sand obsessed area this get a quick
overview this

606
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,420
is my script description

607
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,280
it man you know an example

608
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,780
this is how I invoke my script sold to
say hello

609
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,430
world I ps1 K quick little way of doing
it

610
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,760
and we go from there KK good going on

611
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,310
so let's talk about the final program
this is the one that you can actually

612
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,770
taking a back

613
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:24,010
and actually doing our own timing
discrete but

614
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,349
this is the final program did now this
is something you can actually go back

615
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:30,400
in use we had an incident not where

616
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,640
whenever users was able to download and
execute a remote

617
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,829
and in control utility which bypassed
all our security

618
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,460
and it was very clever very unique in a
way that it did at and actually set up

619
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,079
its own local web service

620
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,530
and then hope back into that and tunnel
back out

621
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,030
very cool and it sucks for me but was
very cool

622
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,760
and so what we wanted to see is if the
change near those files and so I wrote a

623
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,140
quick powershell script

624
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,369
the other just wanna see what files
might have changed within a given period

625
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:01,320
time

626
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,349
and so this is this this is something
that you guys can utilize

627
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:08,750
back at your office and you can build on
it alright so we're gonna circular files

628
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,940
where the final ones or modified in a
specific date range: and we're gonna

629
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,089
create a listen those files and display
it

630
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:17,490
okay so in the interest of time

631
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:21,790
so not just saying you're typing in all
and messing it up had already done it

632
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,950
so what kinda go through it you guys are
welcome to take long

633
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:29,540
this this discord code and everything is
on my site so you can download it later

634
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,190
but I again quick little description
what the sites gonna do

635
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,990
synapse s how to run it to the first
thing we do good

636
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,290
at line 14 is we get the files we've
seen this already now

637
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,640
there is a another printer and they're
called rehearse which is recursive it

638
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,940
goes through each of the individual
folders and grab them

639
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,220
this is a collection so at

640
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,530
Open Close is a collection which means
I'm going to

641
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,099
fill this collection with individual
files if I find them

642
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:00,730
because I don't wanna sent all the files
over there I only want to send the ones

643
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,660
that need my specific conditional logic

644
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,410
so my check to see if I have anything if
this object is

645
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,450
null and the way you reference no in
PowerShell is Darnell

646
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,890
cated then I'll go through each other
file so here's our loop

647
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,040
which we learned your so for each filed

648
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,260
which means I'm creating a variable
called file in the collection

649
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,270
files I'm going to admit have my
conditional logic

650
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,180
up if the file the last write time is
greater than or equal to 61

651
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,660
at midnight and the last write time

652
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,010
is less than or equal to 6 30 at 11:59

653
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,480
so basically I wanna see if anything's
changed my mind again if it is said

654
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,540
that I wanna add that mile the full name

655
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,240
to this list collection and you can use
the plus

656
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,490
equal to do that you could also say plus
list

657
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,910
equal lost whatever but it easy just as
a possible

658
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,670
okay so there's my brackets a check to
see before I right now but

659
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,450
a check to see if my object is null
these are called sanity checks folks

660
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:10,079
don't just too soon just because you
have an object

661
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,240
that is not know all these are my sanity
checks

662
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,660
this is good programming logic think
this way

663
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,510
just because you get something doesn't
mean it is what it but you think it is

664
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:26,050
so it's not null and the link their 0
yet

665
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:31,010
are you asking if I add sanity checks
before or after

666
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:34,470
so I write any checks as I'm writing it
it's just become something that I've

667
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,440
done is a habit

668
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,200
did you get this bit me in the ass so
many times in yet

669
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,869
I have a great question coming yet

670
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:46,040
up yeah

671
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,310
now it's not case sensitive in
PowerShell no not at all

672
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,849
here you can I wanted all right there

673
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,930
decide on run at a time here

674
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,859
you get a drink talking for a comment
fair

675
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:06,859
I F here

676
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,430
go

677
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:19,430
you okay there

678
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:24,650
yet we're way

679
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,329
so he did yeah so they become it was is
at

680
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:31,079
some people will actually write out all
there comes a time and then go back and

681
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:31,530
heard

682
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,579
the Scots ito coding so basically I D
gave multiple

683
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,650
I'm multilayer know what a flow chart is
anymore

684
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,770
eggs and hit

685
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,800
sell its b-side to hire a kill chart
reorganization they don't they mean

686
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,069
Vizio's not use for much of anything
else and learn

687
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:52,300
and but the basically it's a way to
actually put your logic into words so

688
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,000
that you can actually wrap skirt around
it

689
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,880
and you can get a token I so lee Fisher
suffer quick

690
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,130
so if the list is not equal in all them
a check the link then wrap the list

691
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:05,170
if it if we if we don't have anything a
list that means

692
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,490
we did we had files but we couldn't find
anything however if

693
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:13,010
remember let's go back to the top our
first check was a files was not all

694
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:16,069
my sanity check and I say no files are
found

695
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:21,760
so let's go and take a look at the
scripted and say hello world final

696
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,319
but that's correct well dard

697
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:29,010
so if we look we can see that I have two
files here

698
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,540
dream big you know because I'm shorter

699
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,420
and Ken Ham okay so these are the two
files

700
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,950
that were modified in a given date range
so if I script works correctly

701
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,369
we should get tested

702
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:49,480
and everything an H

703
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,859
the moon what

704
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:56,510
yes

705
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,599
I readability yes sir tabs on it you can
actually put everything that I showed

706
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,150
you on a single line

707
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,690
and the reason that I'm showing it to
you this way:

708
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,819
is because I've helped multiple people
who have gotten something of a

709
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:12,010
stackoverflow as a single line and they
can't debug it

710
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,579
okay so there learn it this way first

711
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:19,030
and then go back and you can optimize it
but you can put most everything I just

712
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,040
did you can do in a one-liner

713
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,180
and if you go into some channels they
would they're very one-liner

714
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,609
and II okay so I don't

715
00:42:29,609 --> 00:42:33,730
I don't sit in this channel anymore just
because it pissed me off but and

716
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:38,160
they it one-liner everything I don't
want you guys to do it that way if this

717
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,640
is your first time

718
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,430
get the white space get the tapping in
there just to understand what you're

719
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:42,990
eating

720
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,240
and then go back and change in alright
so that's a great segue because he's a

721
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,069
right at Pauls

722
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:50,140
don't older you spite okay

723
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,810
not everything has to be done in a
single line use the object learn what

724
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,800
you're doing before you start using the
piping

725
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,200
a a lot and it's more money you
understand what your code is doing

726
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,560
before retrying contend said

727
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,069
it's good answer yet

728
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:09,460
and I can't see anybody over there so
that it's a train

729
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:16,460
I thought I see the light go ahead

730
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,740
you mean sanitizers are here

731
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:32,280
the in this this is the full name as a
string object

732
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:39,280
in in

733
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:44,369
LC your try to make sure that I'm this
sanity checking to make sure that for

734
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:44,980
his full name

735
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,329
when you return the object in in
PowerShell

736
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:51,470
the only thing that I can get when I
access that is a string there's no way

737
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,849
that I can get anything else

738
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:56,339
it's kinda like saying is a string a
strain and

739
00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:00,359
you can do something like this you can
you get member so if I D string

740
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:05,010
I do this if I do files because get
child item

741
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,190
be K and I use this thing called

742
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:14,290
get member okay these are all the access
is things that I can access from that

743
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,359
files thing

744
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,160
and you can see that there's methods
that you can use you can use it happy to

745
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,750
do whatever the case may be

746
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:25,140
but if we look at at the four main

747
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,540
it's actually a property value which is
a string

748
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:35,540
the senate that answer your question

749
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,569
good oh yeah it's called the powers
blood sparse play

750
00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:42,140
yeah so there's there's plenty of
different things you can do with that

751
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,780
but for this country here

752
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,730
and yet in in less you got a file name
with

753
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:52,210
AC with and a script and it's it but
it's still not gonna run

754
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:55,280
like you can't name a file named

755
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,050
a PowerShell command because it's gonna
return it as a string a snack

756
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,500
