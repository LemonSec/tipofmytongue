Stacy banks

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,580
and welcome to securing your assets from
espionage

stop the pillaging and keep your beauty
yes there might be some pirate

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,810
themes tonight which deal with it
awesome just checkin assortment

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,469
okay Sep naturally

9
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,090
disclaimer everything is my sarcastic
humor

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,180
not attributable to past present future
employers

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,020
yet this is all about me so

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,539
again for those of you that don't know
me I'm a geek

13
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:01,780
a pirate captain up

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,750
triathlete I've been doing it. for
sixteen years now

15
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,590
the last 12 I focused on government
contracting

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,030
and its varied from everything from

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,680
dawning high performance computers to
you doing

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,400
a lot of this massive heart self there's
a lot of experience to draw from from a

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,820
lot angle spend less

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,740
and at present I am

21
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,130
I'm currently a more recent employees if
tenable network security

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,500
so say ass

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,680
I'm happy to be with the cool kids Sep

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
let's get this thing started so

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,430
I'm gonna talk to you tonight about
countermeasures

26
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,189
and how we can in a secure thinks I'm

27
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:55,070
gonna try to keep it interesting at of
course

28
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,119
there is some %uh the technical aspects
we do have to cover of course

29
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,860
Sep I was talk about targets

30
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,890
methods and the countermeasures but
first

31
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,010
just a really let's think and

32
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:19,060
I did agree to

33
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,330
step espionage

34
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,830
don't read the whole thing or the or

35
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:35,830
up

36
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,620
fuck

37
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,620
group

38
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,830
for the most part evolved

39
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,959
fighting a person he knows something are
have something

40
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,200
but you can induce them secretly she
gives you

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,379
that almost always involves a betrayal
of trust

42
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,890
his aldrich ames when a far more

43
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,180
reset spies that a lot of that stuff

44
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,890
site now he really knows what he's
talking about

45
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,769
and here for the most part it does

46
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,340
involve exploiting this connections that
we have

47
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,430
and it could be minor corrections it
could be major connections

48
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,420
there doesn't even have to be a
connection because honestly

49
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,409
were human and we are the most powerful
thing in our security

50
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,010
so that's really why this is so
important

51
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:49,750
we are the weakest link exact lay

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,549
you venture brain now

53
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:59,459
this was something that came up on the
news today and this is just kinda

54
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,489
wannabes

55
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,840
you know the media doesn't necessarily

56
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,840
get things right all the time so it's
kinda like defining hackers

57
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,030
they want to label us that like so

58
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,639
the Titleist disgruntled workers hacking
employers

59
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,490
is on the rise but when you actually
look down

60
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,340
and I'm not sure how well this is
showing up up there but says

61
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,870
the workers use services like Dropbox

62
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,889
inc's cloud storage or software that
lets them gain remote access to

63
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,070
corporate networks

64
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,919
and trade secrets now that's not exactly

65
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,350
hacking that's just utilizing

66
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,440
services that we have access to for data
exfiltration

67
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,130
and really this is more on the side have

68
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,449
bad network security and

69
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:01,340
this is something that we will cover
later on

70
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,060
but just to point out there's a lot of
sensationalism

71
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,130
out there in regards to you what hashing
yes

72
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:15,130
after sure we're all familiar with bad
definitions at this point

73
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,590
thank you

74
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,889
this is just this is one of those I have
to set the stage

75
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:31,930
you know I have to do the

76
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,930
these are the laws that accessed so

77
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,400
for business ask in Osh we have economic
espionage Act 1996

78
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,470
and this is what really set up things
for having an actual law

79
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,919
or we can go after people better doing
things like

80
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,180
stealing and training trade secrets

81
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,460
because are intellectual property
nowadays

82
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,509
with everything being so data-driven
those who own the data

83
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:02,569
those are the people that can really
make commitments

84
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,300
money is still very much a part in it
but it's really the data

85
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,460
that is controlling who has access to
things

86
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,580
and just look at everything that's going
on

87
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,590
once you have the access you can do
anything

88
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,639
other money really helps it

89
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,060
it its

90
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,330
but this actually sets the precedent
this

91
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,539
this gives it to where the feds can go
after people and actually charge them

92
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:38,560
in the theft of trade secrets and

93
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,080
trade secrets as refined as a secret
formula method

94
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,300
or device the gives you an advantage
over your competitors

95
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,870
and this is basically you tonight design
something

96
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,449
hot in New and you've got to the market
first

97
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:57,759
and this helps you get getting edge
because really

98
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,819
the only edge we have is getting their
first

99
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,289
and beating out our competition so if
people are

100
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:08,470
doing any of these

101
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,789
method to get internet works still our
intellectual property

102
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,050
make copies and sell them on the cheap

103
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,740
well suddenly those millions of dollars
we've invested

104
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,050
in doing research and development it
goes away

105
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,550
and you have China knockoffs for five
dollars

106
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,930
when you need to sell at a hundred
dollars track shouli

107
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,470
make a return on your investment

108
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,880
and that really hurts the ingenuity

109
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,490
our system has unfortunately

110
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:49,490
a lot of R&D is a very heavily
front-loaded system

111
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:55,970
and again I'm kinda front-loading on me

112
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,930
technical data and then we'll get into
the funnest

113
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,220
there with me so

114
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,500
the driving forces behind all this

115
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,990
corporations are going to see it a lot
of money if they can still

116
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,280
your ideas and your research you slaved
away for

117
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,569
a year to developing some awesome new
algorithm that's gonna

118
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:22,080
speed-up search engines and its gonna be
the next

119
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,430
thing way better than Google

120
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,560
to they're looking for

121
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,200
all your weaknesses to get into your
system still that

122
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,969
and be. to the market because that's
really what determines market share

123
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,810
who's there first now who has the better
project

124
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,860
products not project but who actually
gets there first

125
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,250
who gets the name out there and who
captures the attention

126
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,250
sadly you don't necessarily have to have
a better product

127
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,950
you just got a better marketing and
timing

128
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,990
that's the winner of course

129
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,230
individuals also have a huge game

130
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,470
and a stake in this because well

131
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,040
as people we tend to be creating

132
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,630
so a lot of people do it for money some
people are going to do it because

133
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,050
frankly

134
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,440
they're pissed off they might have a
bone to pick with their current or past

135
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,560
employer

136
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,149
so they might sell something or you know
even their government

137
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:31,560
I am sure we know a lot of people in the
news recently that have

138
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,709
dumb things like this yes so

139
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:39,480
there are a lot of motivations for
people to go through this

140
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,130
on besides both the payee and the pair

141
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,370
and it doesn't necessarily have to be a
financial gain

142
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,839
some people are just looking to you get
the information out

143
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,100
and to ruin someone else revenge

144
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,640
is a huge motivator often more
motivating than money

145
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,980
her name where humans where week

146
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,519
so boy look at this

147
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:14,790
obviously we have yeah a variety of
targets it's not necessarily a huge

148
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,100
brady a target there is a limit to what
you can actually get

149
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,440
but by and large includes things like
trade secrets muscling

150
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,899
now you're things that you've gone off

151
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,130
down a trademark filed a patent on

152
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,010
they wanna get an edge on that and the
issue the market

153
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,079
clientless can also be a huge thing

154
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,660
hey get access to someone's you know
conference room

155
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:50,630
get on their network he knows where you
can download

156
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,209
personnel records just being able to

157
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,690
mouse still some key personnel oh my god

158
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,899
the brain drain allowed on people

159
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,910
sometimes are worth more than the actual
knowledge

160
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,910
because if you've managed to get
somewhere and you can still awake key

161
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,500
people

162
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,750
not only have you started their progress

163
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,019
you start up around and

164
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,649
obviously they're going to be coming
with the knowledge of what they've done

165
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:25,089
Fort that other product which will end
up being integrated

166
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:30,760
how brain drain is a very real thing

167
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,390
course business development marketing

168
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,190
you'll see this across pair you know
commercial sector

169
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,029
and public sector knowing how much

170
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:45,250
your competition is bidding

171
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,490
oh yeah that is a huge bonus

172
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,019
and that's actually one of the things
that will get you jumped

173
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:56,510
out a bid for federal contracts

174
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,829
if you haven't inside have tracked
knowing

175
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:03,940
what betting rate is Sam

176
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,339
yep things to think about

177
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,420
things like deniable possibility yeah

178
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,720
they tend to be issues and of course
research and development

179
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,459
hey if you can get the designs for the
next

180
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,740
big claim that Boeing's developing

181
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:30,740
dude that's a lotta money and that's a
lotta time

182
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,690
and everybody knows

183
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,660
so with that your Ford or threats come
from

184
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,820
we have external and internal threats

185
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,850
but the thing yes are and how threats

186
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,070
they're both intentional you know the
people that they want to screw us over

187
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,660
they're upset they didn't get a pay
raise they've been

188
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,209
you know undervalued or

189
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,589
now they just don't let your management
style whatever the problem is their

190
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,170
intention of sending out

191
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:06,790
to wreck system then there's the people
that

192
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:12,430
wealthy kinda knocked the coke can over
on a server or

193
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,139
yeah they tripped over a plugin and
flood

194
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,300
critical systems and everything goes
down

195
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,399
there's accidents but they also
contribute to this

196
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,880
because they can be a huge hindrance

197
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,750
in the continuation things and of course

198
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,620
foreign governments at

199
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,060
it's not just about the next big

200
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,079
your fighter plane it's about minor
things like

201
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,260
the next processor now we

202
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,110
we have to consider that there's a lot
of angles here because

203
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,389
business isn't just about businesses
making money

204
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,959
that also feeds into our governments
making money

205
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,079
to taxation and other methods so

206
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,490
there's a huge investment from multi
tears

207
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,230
and of course I guess I really shoulda

208
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,880
relabeled this crackers lead here now

209
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,690
hackers have to this you know people
that are looking to

210
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:27,680
make a difference electronically people
that want a free the information

211
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,600
and well you know

212
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:39,459
just people that wanna screw things up
to put a little more nicely

213
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:44,940
South and this is just a highlight the
key methods that I'm gonna go through

214
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm gonna kick off a scenario in a
moment

215
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,990
so key methods that people are usually
go to use when they're

216
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,079
setting out to you get this information
from him

217
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:02,660
you're gonna see them using like Delphi
and free texting methods

218
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,750
obviously computer hacking or what
people consider hacking

219
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,370
and open source intelligence cuz

220
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,630
oh my god the things that are posted out
there

221
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:21,620
hey it's a new world you don't have to
do much work

222
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,329
Sep I mister talking about these methods

223
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:29,870
lol more detail and I'm gonna try to put
into

224
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,959
scenarios and just make it more
interesting

225
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,500
so with this for scenario

226
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,589
consider that our company

227
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,630
they've got a new technology it's
bleeding edge they've got something

228
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,110
really awesome coming out and

229
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,970
this industry has a steep entry cost a
requires a lot of

230
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,899
R&D efforts to get a product out there

231
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:01,329
and several years in the making so
people are looking to cut corners

232
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:04,910
they want to get there fast they want to
get there now and they wanna make their

233
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,139
money

234
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,540
because as we are now investors are
impatient

235
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,480
with them I see that return and if not
they're gonna start cutting

236
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,459
so I'm a scenario I'm gonna borrow from
office space

237
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:22,320
see so the good guys are intact

238
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,560
and the bad guys are in a trade

239
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,100
figured you guys can probably relate to
assign

240
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,589
I should so

241
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,730
just to set it up and give me an
explanation of what I everything else

242
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,829
so don't I am free texting attacks

243
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:48,769
so obvious link I'm pretty sure everyone
here is

244
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:53,509
well aware of what social engineering
and tails

245
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:57,930
pretty much yes like confidence can add
more or less

246
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,339
you know you act like you belong you
convinced he valuable on

247
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,919
when you get them to give you what you
want

248
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,030
head it works great

249
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,870
pic but there are several ways you can

250
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:19,740
utilized less and this includes things
like going to conferences

251
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,020
now sell

252
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,549
up well conferences service and
information volunteers

253
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:30,669
and we'll touch on all that

254
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:33,820
cell you have the Bob

255
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,559
what would you say you to you here

256
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,020
well consider this you go to conference

257
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,070
you're hanging out at the bar another
geek what's up

258
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,669
hey how's it going let me buy you a
drink oh my god

259
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,780
did you see that Capitals game last
night can you believe it

260
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,100
I was awesome so you start talking

261
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,710
you start geeking out over common

262
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,870
interesting hacking whatever the topic s

263
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,789
but then for mister talking a little
more specific

264
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,230
but your couple beers n you don't
necessarily

265
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,110
me see where it's going and all the
sudden there

266
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:22,110
asking you a lot more pointed questions
about your projects

267
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,669
but its her because someone finally

268
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,990
hear something like I got that is the
most interesting thing

269
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,760
over tell me more how well honor

270
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,000
did you figure that out wow

271
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,660
you know my mind just

272
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,299
there's a lot of Gio feeling and of

273
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,390
you guys are awesome

274
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,070
but you know

275
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:57,140
some people need the effete and they buy
into it

276
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,929
and then they just aren't answering more
questions are more questions

277
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:06,220
this also falls in line with this random
survey showed it

278
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,980
hi were conducting a survey

279
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,669
you know we're coming from care magazine
could you tell us what kind of service

280
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:14,880
you have

281
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,390
0 you have Windows Linux what version
ends

282
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,190
what suffered you run on that and then
they're getting more detailed

283
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,120
information

284
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,980
version types and everything and this is
more or less

285
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,410
a social engineering method is running
in maps can against you

286
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,350
they're getting the information for
Piper since you have I can go through

287
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,340
and i cant are you a lot quicker

288
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:42,539
it a lot easier an they haven't actually
set about making a footprint on your

289
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:43,880
network by dealing a

290
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,309
in maps Q because hey there just call it
appear so sad man said

291
00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:53,970
hey we'd like to award you with a free
subscription can you tell us some

292
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,580
information so we can send you a better
magazine

293
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:02,090
and you know maybe at center free
conference or something

294
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,580
it's amazing what you can get by
offering people something for free

295
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:13,580
who would've time oh wait that's right
marketing

296
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,380
are not much for choice

297
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,150
so obviously where me

298
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,809
but ASO our computers are to you

299
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:33,840
because well let's face it we are the
weakest link

300
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,929
and when humans are involved things can
happen

301
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:42,210
its Campbell law

302
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,270
so with that we have issues about
computers

303
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,360
not everybody secures our systems to a
level that we should

304
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,010
sometimes for lazy sometimes its project
requirements because

305
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:01,530
you now honestly how many have you have
had a thing for its

306
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,820
we need it to work we don't care for
secure

307
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,650
we need it to work can use to work now

308
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,520
and this is what we're usually up
against in security so its

309
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,919
facing the issue I'll what's gonna break

310
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,539
if we implement a patch if we implement
more anal retentive security

311
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:20,840
requirements

312
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,400
and it kind of a grudge match because
honestly even plan we

313
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,870
are involve from start for development
up system

314
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,049
it's still a fight to get things
implemented because there's always time

315
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:36,289
line for getting things done

316
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:40,760
and making sure it works because the end
users are more part

317
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,080
our security

318
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,049
never mind what makes tears

319
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:54,820
I'm sorry I missed sendak it

320
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,900
well you know at what's the joke you
know you're a

321
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,450
UNIX admin when you see a bumper sticker
that says users are losers and you don't

322
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,940
think they're talking about the war on
drugs

323
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,260
that's a little eighty use but still
applicable

324
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:18,330
so with that you know obviously we can't
control things when it's a zero-day hack

325
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:22,690
its new its aji we have to roll with the
punches

326
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,830
that's just the way it gets

327
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,860
it's not something we can plan for you
know we can be proactive

328
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,490
we can think like the attacker weekend
attacker systems deep penetration

329
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,919
testing

330
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,720
you know really work at securing our
systems

331
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,880
and trying to make our developers under
slat

332
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,130
understand our side effects

333
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,720
and management

334
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,750
but then there are continual problems
that we have

335
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,900
you know brute force the still excess

336
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,090
we have you know we can caption on
password files

337
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,590
password file saved in clear text CNN

338
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:08,960
now cross site scripting people not
changing factory default passwords

339
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,380
you know it's 2014 and people still

340
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,039
don't change factory default passwords

341
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,500
okay I'm not judging really I am

342
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,500
switch

343
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,809
an you now of course things like

344
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:30,870
bring your own device is which

345
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:35,640
you know it it also brings viruses and
other issues

346
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,929
and can somebody just create yes like we
have USB condoms can we create a general

347
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:48,929
bring your own device condom that like
firewalls everything

348
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:59,400
while you know boss had a method for
that it was colored

349
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,669
if you don't know what it is see me
after

350
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:09,169
but again this pretty much sums up

351
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:13,350
mister securities feelings for house
things are not necessarily

352
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,640
implemented sometimes

353
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,809
sometimes technology is

354
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:23,330
such technology itself is just poor
implementation

355
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:29,059
and I did parents you are industry best
standards

356
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:36,059
and if you want to know about compliance
to free to see me after

357
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,950
and I'm sure every once well where

358
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,480
open source intelligence and I got

359
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,960
the amount of information on the
Internet

360
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,559
it is such a charmer treasure trove you
can't find out so much just from you

361
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:56,929
know

362
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:02,789
press releases its you know newsletter
use

363
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:06,320
individual blog post

364
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,600
I got the things that people reveal to
later

365
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,169
face but I'm I got social media has been
up

366
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:17,570
boon to you our the how can I retrieve

367
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:24,570
said I have to get I student um ok

368
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,100
to corporate spying a recap

369
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,500
pppp

370
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,549
it's a replacement it's not an exact
wording and you can

371
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:42,990
space track new car

372
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,380
you and share

373
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,919
mister you or most likely I would expect
all if you are familiar with the scene

374
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:55,679
you know corporate accounts payable Nina
speaking

375
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:02,169
there is so much information you can get
from just very basic things

376
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:05,220
but you're just just give you up

377
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,580
a sixty ample I mean back during war
court

378
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,100
to you in the cold war and well most
local

379
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,419
or not the russians would actually send
their people over

380
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:20,429
they would have to do you you know too
much end up

381
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:24,090
work orkut I mean it's still do all the
standards set for create their assets

382
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,350
and everything

383
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,929
but there is so much they can't you just
getting

384
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:33,010
newsletters from military bases

385
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,900
and you know other similar

386
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,390
information sources

387
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,330
they take you have things like hey

388
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,159
this naval bases christening the SNU
cruiser

389
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,539
and its you know gonna be going off to
you

390
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:55,440
this destination and on you know August
1st

391
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,450
you know what these are things that you
know get announced because

392
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,520
we're proud of our advance man send
something awesome is happening

393
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,630
but the enemy can use it against us

394
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,650
this is very much true in the corporate
world as well

395
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:16,210
name we have competition everywhere

396
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,570
ap it's a dog-eat-dog world that's

397
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,740
real reality of it

398
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,370
cell what can we do in order to kind

399
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,850
stem the flow of information slow things
down

400
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:38,320
obviously we need to implement better
information security

401
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,510
physical personnel security

402
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:48,080
and training because let's face it

403
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,649
how many people take peter is a precious
thing

404
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:57,419
and they're not really missing it

405
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:01,880
they just don't care anymore

406
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,510
so what exactly can we do in order to
improve things

407
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,299
well we do have miss things come
security baseline switch

408
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:16,200
from a variety locations

409
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,770
including the government amp

410
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,039
we have nest is a good source

411
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,929
I sell her bizarre these are all things
that we can build prop

412
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:32,820
here in some instances you are required
to know

413
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,710
but in other instances such as the
corporate world

414
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,690
you can elect what you're going to
implement but they're all kinda driven

415
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,149
from

416
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:46,029
a base model love best practices

417
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:49,179
and that's really what we're looking for
now we'll

418
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:52,940
we can I wanna take what has worked

419
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,250
what's been proven true and we want to
build on that

420
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,669
and with that now obviously many
continuous testing

421
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:04,870
have government's move to continuous
monitoring model

422
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,779
where you know your constantly testing

423
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:11,789
also so it should be really every month

424
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:14,669
you should be running your stand she
should be testing your system seeing

425
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,140
what's new

426
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,330
because you know what something has
failed some things had to be rebuilt

427
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,090
and yes some things rolled back

428
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,260
so suddenly you're missing patches and
you have a vulnerability out there and

429
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:34,090
you really need to know that excess

430
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,909
let's face it not all backups our app
today

431
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:42,169
that happens

432
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,610
people way now of course

433
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,480
actually using encryption you

434
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,559
no more password files maintained in
clear taxed actually

435
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,110
encrypting those you are using

436
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:03,010
live in corruption for live data
encrypting data at rest

437
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,169
and user these are things to be
considered

438
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:10,620
course intrusion detection systems

439
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,799
units it's common sense but

440
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,320
its common sense for us it's not common
sense us early for

441
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,350
business entities and management because

442
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,559
unfortunately security well

443
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,090
you know where costner were not
necessarily a profit center and less

444
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,880
word directly involved with

445
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,149
client consultations and we're going out
and we're helping a client gets care

446
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:38,149
so when where internal

447
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:41,770
were cost center and we have to fight
against that we have to prove that we

448
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,970
have value

449
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,940
that we have a return on investment and
that they need to be throwing money at

450
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,659
us

451
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:50,830
because there is a risk now

452
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,090
it may not necessarily be credit card
data

453
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,159
but there is an inherent risks because

454
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,429
everyone has some Pharma intellectual
property

455
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:05,899
that they need to maintain to maintain
their edge

456
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:09,140
and of course champ data classifications

457
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,340
it's not just a government issue in the
commercial sector you have to consider

458
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,860
what is a trade secret you know what do
you value what's your holiest a police

459
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,029
versus 20 really not care about

460
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:25,419
and if you're dealing with things like
customer Dana

461
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:28,710
and credit card Dana banking data

462
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:32,740
these are things that need to be secured
a lot more

463
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,730
and well we've seen on the breaches
there's a lot issues out there that we

464
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,590
still need to address

465
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:48,590
I just for giggles good

466
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,450
not everybody has the people's

467
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:02,070
but she to catalyze a sense you physical
and personnel security

468
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,669
and now it is we have an issue in
regards with bring your own device

469
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:10,620
huge issue cuz you have everything from
USPS where

470
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,559
you know you have to do. Dean
specifically like pentagon where

471
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,590
USB has been turned off

472
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,090
it's been film a super list you can even
you know try to force something that

473
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,649
happened

474
00:32:23,649 --> 00:32:28,830
amicus there's people like us to find a
way around it

475
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,500
shit okay why not right

476
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,049
but now there's other concerns as well
now

477
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:40,260
how many places can you take you know
your cell phone into

478
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,440
everyone well mostly everybody has a

479
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,019
smartphowned some people so have called
found

480
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:51,269
you you know I

481
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:55,630
but you know you bring an end there's so
much you can launch of the sanction you

482
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,250
just a connection to the wireless

483
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,710
hey s just asking for something to
happen

484
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,440
course we need to consider things like
who has access

485
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,010
because I sling how many programs are

486
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,010
actually continuously reviewing

487
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,610
under you know not daily but on a
regular enough basis

488
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:22,019
who has access to what your sysadmin
just moved over security

489
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:25,260
well certainly they have different
permissions

490
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,029
year they should have access to security
base lives but they should be able to do

491
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:29,620
you

492
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,130
certain other things as a separation of
duties and these things need to be

493
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,539
maintained

494
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:39,289
but there's not a sir that continuation
a

495
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:43,440
you know checks and balances and

496
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,440
background checks that's come and go

497
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:54,440
but a background check doesn't
necessarily mean anything nowadays

498
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,090
African a definite match credit checks

499
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,210
in a bad credit you can have good credit
but doesn't mean you're good individual

500
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,460
all that means is you are aren't good
with money

501
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,230
that's just my and of course reference
checks

502
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,790
yeah there's things can be faked really
can add

503
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:18,300
and let's let's not forget

504
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,889
in a ruler to Bell personnel

505
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:26,200
and physical scaring you know you need
these checks and balances

506
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,250
because when you have things like

507
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,320
yeah he should have been fired actually
two years ago

508
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,349
but there is an issue and that never
went through payroll

509
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:39,589
which yes

510
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:46,169
there's a glitch they fixed it thank you
very much

511
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:49,409
that justice future problems

512
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:53,679
it suicide from a styling up

513
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,980
whole lotta a fire alarms

514
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:03,980
and smoke detectors much 22

515
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,050
a stapler and a paycheck to because
snout that was

516
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,730
the capital Manama so I mean if

517
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,050
a lot it really comes down to training

518
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:22,270
and getting people to you well what
security what some today let's face it

519
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,940
we want to do it but we need to give
them you know

520
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,560
some motion on it we need to help
encourage them

521
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,040
explain it to them so they understand it
an

522
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,579
and others varying opinions

523
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:41,720
positive negative on a lot of these
purse professional certifications

524
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,920
but it's one of those things that

525
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,700
a lot of places take these things
serious so just in terms of training

526
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,070
and yeah professional presentation

527
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:01,260
so you know there is a certified
confidentiality officer

528
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,060
which is offered through be and I'll do
this at the end after

529
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,570
Special K up mister the business

530
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,480
espionage countermeasures and

531
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,670
can control countermeasure Association

532
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:20,839
ase certified information systems
security professional

533
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:24,410
I know there's a loss on pains on that
and certified protection professional

534
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,700
which is a lot more on physical side of
things but

535
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,349
its a satchel and just various
professional training air wing

536
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:36,380
need to stay up to date but you know we
also need to be

537
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,079
pushing back explaining to manage that

538
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,070
there is a return on the investment were
not a cost center were actually saving

539
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,800
you money in the long run because

540
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,079
if you implement the security well guess
what each and I'm gonna be a couple

541
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,339
million in the hall because you're on
the next web to reach

542
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,910
eyes are things we need to explain so we
were thinking about

543
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,940
is this good for the company well

544
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,180
there's a lot of interpretation to you
and

545
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,320
really comes down to you really at the
base a bit

546
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,560
return investment and

547
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,950
you know we GNE we need to spend some
time and

548
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,359
come up with a better way so we stopped
looking

549
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:24,070
like we're costner because really where
benefits under

550
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:31,070
for protecting everything and now we're
making things work

551
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:38,520
yes you know a ten dollar stapler is
gonna save the delay

552
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,880
and

553
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,500
that is basically it mean does anybody
have any questions comments

554
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,369
tackling a particular

555
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:58,369
great more story

556
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,960
cost its

557
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,010
Z

558
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:20,160
said basically is there something we can
present to you

559
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,300
executives that you know we're not a
cossack and thats

560
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,760
there's actually a whole conference a
brown you know

561
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,780
security and return on investment and

562
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:38,560
seriously there there said security
economics based conference out there

563
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,130
it's all security metrics yeah

564
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:49,130
I'm not back Tiki on you

565
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,670
liners measures

566
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,109
its management they want dashboards

567
00:38:58,109 --> 00:39:02,440
you know make up some ice pie charts

568
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,099
I mean really it it's going to come down
to

569
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:09,970
your own issues and where you can show
the return on investment so a lot of it

570
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,329
is looking at

571
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:14,400
yet whether the current reaches out
there how much have they lost how much

572
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,470
have they had to invest in saying every
assuring credit cards

573
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,230
alar you know canceling you know
fraudulent

574
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,400
charges and then turning that around and
saying

575
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,460
well hey if you'd implemented the system
that I told you about six months ago

576
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,690
we wouldn't have had this breach and you
wanna say five million dollars

577
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,940
in all this

578
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:45,940
shop

579
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,570
a lot of trending right up

580
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:01,940
is

581
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:07,490
include pictures it

582
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:12,460
in stairs

583
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,349
there yes

584
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:22,030
for anyone else

585
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:29,030
yes up

586
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,880
oh you mean complain to the checklists

587
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,380
wow ok

588
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,859
I'm really gonna check on Iran on that
but you know I'm

589
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:52,050
I'm I don't like that a lot of it is
really just so you know you try to work

590
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,450
with them tried to explain that you know
it's not just

591
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,530
yet we just say yes we do this and we
get a check box its

592
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,990
now we have to do this auditors are
coming through

593
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,760
explaining to them the issues but also
explaining things

594
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,490
you know depending on your environment
any if you're in a government

595
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:13,150
environment where your contractor or
government employees

596
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,290
and make things a little easier in being
able to say luck

597
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:20,060
this is no reflection on US sysadmins
our manager

598
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,630
as just a reflection on the current
buyer Matt and say

599
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:27,859
luck we don't have XY and z. we need
this much funding

600
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:33,670
so we can implemented and then you know
that ends up getting into hurry class

601
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:37,980
for having mission essayist issues and
you can get more funding

602
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,650
hopefully address the issues and it's
presenting in

603
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,660
you know where you're not being
confrontational you're being

604
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,310
helpful and you know just

605
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:55,349
this is also where interpersonal
communication comes into play

606
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:59,290
and being able to communicate and best
technical and management

607
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:02,869
speak and explain in two different paths

608
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:06,180
and say this is what we need and this is
what needs to happen

609
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:10,950
and make them understand it in a
commercial sector

610
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,630
I have to admit I'm still you know kinda

611
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,920
during my burn and face into that sector

612
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,109
now I've you know only recently left
government contracting

613
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:28,109
so but I'm learning a language

614
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:35,109
there's there's still a bit of a similar
to that

615
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,450
yes just because Emir compliance
requirements

616
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,950
doesn't mean you're secure it's not be
end-all be-all

617
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,349
there are still issues out there you
still need to be Sh you know

618
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:57,089
be aware of what the top trends are what
your topics use our

619
00:42:57,089 --> 00:43:01,740
and that's part if you know having a
really robust continuous monitoring

620
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,510
you know your you doing monthly scanning
your verifying

621
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:09,040
you know if possible false positives for
us negatives

622
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,810
and it's just part of having a good
network setup

623
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:16,550
and if you don't you're trying to
communicate with management

624
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:23,550
that we need to invest time and money
into this

625
00:43:55,339 --> 00:44:02,339
up

626
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:16,619
yet

627
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,280
oh man a lot of that is

628
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,010
I'm their part in those capturing and
the acts

629
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,910
and obviously a lot of after the fact
that scene what's gone on

630
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,369
and I mean obviously have to be at that
point

631
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:38,670
you know kind of pro-active mashup
connections down

632
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,880
but also gather some information see you
can go back and say

633
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,160
here look this happened

634
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,450
and you know kind of document where now

635
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,910
I'm people pretty much trust in
compliance compliance is great

636
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:55,970
it helps you meet a minimum but decir
thing

637
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:58,970
it's a minimum baseline it's not the be
all end all

638
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:05,960
here

639
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,450
school

640
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:18,079
where yes

641
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,240
see way

642
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:29,240
yes

643
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:35,520
up

644
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,060
where up

645
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:46,060
me week we have to educate management
basic pipe

646
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:07,480
no that's that's a great way to get the
point across during tabletops

647
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,900
and showing them an example and if they
still don't get it

648
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,190
take it to a lab yes set up for
environment

649
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,220
and walk them through it show them for
their honorable

650
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,290
and say look we have to go above and
beyond

651
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:27,109
up

652
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:30,599
equip

653
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:33,680
that used to be my whole job in the
world

654
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,339
good your

655
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:44,339
ship

656
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:49,910
but

657
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,920
it

658
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,599
heard just

659
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,490
those her as for

660
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:08,490
here

661
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:14,290
up

662
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:19,920
dolls lighter

663
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,369
and that's a good point I mean there's
so many facets to security

664
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:27,730
but unfortunately I'm through everything
we've kind of been put in our own loss

665
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:28,859
eilers

666
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:32,349
and we kinda have to break out on that
silo mentality and we need to start

667
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,970
working together it's not

668
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:37,569
compliance alone is not going to solve
the problem less is going to get us to a

669
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:38,530
baseline

670
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:43,040
we need to work with everyone else make
sure we have a really good baseline that

671
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,210
incorporates

672
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,130
architecture for security enterprise
architecture

673
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,450
so that you know when projects are
actually starting

674
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:55,200
where there were integrated and they
care more about

675
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,510
the big picture ensuring that the data
is secure

676
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:05,510
and not just that things work

677
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:12,559
your up

678
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:38,160
alls up calls

679
00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:00,480
up

680

lake

681
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:14,490
all so we need to wrap

682
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:18,300
