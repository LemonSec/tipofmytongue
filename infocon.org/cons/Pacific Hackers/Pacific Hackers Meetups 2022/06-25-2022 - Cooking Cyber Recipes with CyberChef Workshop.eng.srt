131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,800
emphasize you know the the variance

132
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,960
groups and the underrepresented groups

133

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,440
when they go and apply for a job you

137

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,960
it's not just about money it's also

146
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199

this just

261
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,640
you know happened that i

262
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,440
acquired them but yeah so that's pretty

263
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,120
much about me uh

264
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,279
i don't wanna bore you with that

265
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
uh let's see

266
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,120
and then you know now let's get into

267
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,320
what is cyber chef so celery chef is is

268
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,800
known as the the swiss army knife

269
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
and it's basically a

270
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
a very easy tool that you can use to

271
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,880
make your life uh better

272
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,839
they do have a github repository which

273
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,800
is right here and they also have the uh

274
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
a live instance right and i'm you know

275
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,079
i'm gonna show you what the live

276
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,240
instance is the good thing about it is

277
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,800
like for example i pass around actually

278
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,560
can you pass me that again i i show

279
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
this um paper

280
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,200
that uh on visa san francisco if you

281
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,880
were didn't have the chance to attend i

282
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,360
don't know if you can see it um they

283
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,160
they show they were giving out this uh

284
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,120
uh

285
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,760
challenge and it was just basically a

286
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,320
challenge that they use for their secure

287
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
engineers as part of their own boring

288
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,079
process if you

289
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,680
uh happen to

290
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
solve the challenge then obviously that

291
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,519
means you know the stuff and then you're

292
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,760
going to move on to the next round of

293
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,120
interviews

294
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,519
so yeah this this was very fun i i

295
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,680
actually have to be honest i just found

296
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,720
it today

297
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,360
and and i was glad because it was just

298
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,839
perfect timing okay so anyways

299
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,440
the reason i say that is if you don't

300
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
have a computer in front of you that's

301
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,079
okay because

302
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,800
um cyber chef is online and it's it's a

303
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,120
web platform so you can use it from your

304
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,959
from your cell phone so that's you know

305
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,239
one of the great things about it

306
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,600
uh it's this one right here uh

307
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
uh let's see the live instance is this

308
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,519
one right here and but i'll i'll i'll

309
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,839
show you once once i go go through the

310
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,959
demo um there is four you know main

311
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,519
areas in cyber chef uh the first one is

312
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,440
the operations

313
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
this is where

314
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,200
uh you know you're gonna

315
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
those are the ingredients that you're

316
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,560
gonna be using for you to create your

317
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,600
recipes right uh your input that's the

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,399
information that goes in so in this case

319
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
for example this is the challenge so

320
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,399
that that's going to go in

321
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,839
into the inputs panel and then um once

322
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,519
you know what you're trying to solve

323
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,720
here then you move the the operations to

324
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,519
the recipes section and then that's

325
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,519
basically an ingredient so operations

326
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,200
are ingredients and then you're creating

327
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,440
your recipe based on that right you put

328
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
the input which is the stove and then

329
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
it's gonna cook it and then the output

330
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
is basically the dish that you're

331
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,399
performing

332
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,839
so that's basically those are the main

333
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,399
things that you can use um so there's

334
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,160
two ways of doing this

335
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,800
uh again the uh the local installation

336
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,959
versus the web installation there is

337
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,240
prone pros and cons of this

338
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,560
so the web obviously it's just go to the

339
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,240
website you don't have to you know

340
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,279
there's no

341
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,200
login no nothing

342
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,639
but

343
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,959
there's obviously some cons about it

344
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,680
if you're doing um digital forensics if

345
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,600
you're doing blue teaming defense and

346
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,800
stuff like that

347
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,920
you know

348
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,760
you're basically importing information

349
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,079
into someone else's website so obviously

350
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
that's wrong right so what you want to

351
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,240
do in that case is create a local

352
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,720
installation whether on your machine or

353
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,519
create a a cyber chef server which is

354
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,600
basically you know

355
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,519
a website with a couple of files and

356
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,399
that's it that's it's there's not no

357
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,200
like

358
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,519
an installation required it's basically

359
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,160
you know putting the you know

360
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,320
when you're setting the web server uh

361
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,279
just

362
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,079
uh know where the uh the index for

363
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,680
for that particular website is and

364
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,279
that's it that's that's all you have to

365
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,240
do um so the pros of you know doing a

366
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,399
local installation or as a web server in

367
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,480
your company is that you're keeping all

368
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,199
the files internally you don't have to

369
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,360
um you know uh

370
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,320
nothing is going to be exposed um

371
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,240
and obviously you're gonna be able to

372
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,639
save recipes not just for you but for

373
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,240
your whole team right so that's that's a

374
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,279
good thing um you it's gonna have uh the

375
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,800
the platform is gonna save everything in

376
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,160
there the cons is that that the uh the

377
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,199
files how they're updated it's basically

378
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,920
uh it's a manual update so it's not like

379
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
a button that you push it's gonna

380
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
download the new or the latest thing

381
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,800
it's not like that you actually have to

382
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,040
download the files and copy and paste

383
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,360
them into the the folder and that's it

384
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,320
right so that's probably the downside of

385
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,199
that

386
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,880
um and in terms of

387
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,279
useful operation actually i think i

388
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
i um

389
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,079
i skip one side before we continue if

390
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,360
you have a computer go ahead and and

391
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,440
and at least open the first two um

392
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,920
challenges here the first one and i'm

393
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,240
going to show you really quick uh it's

394
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
the rsa

395
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,880
platform that we use let me let me log

396
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,720
out of this so if you go to the

397
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,720
rsa.basecyber.net

398
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,880
you can create a page i'm sorry a login

399
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,120
uh you don't have to put like you know

400
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,399
uh

401
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,519
like

402
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
actual information you can put

403
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,639
something's name

404
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,480
whatever email whatever username and a

405
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,399
password just remember you your username

406
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,320
and password obviously because once you

407
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
log in you're you're gonna need that

408
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,959
information so let me log in really

409
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,839
quick um

410
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,279
and i and there are some of the

411
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,600
challenges there the reason why i want

412
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,199
to mention about these challenges is

413
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,760
because for one uh the challenges that

414
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,360
we we put in this um in the ctf

415
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
uh the first two challenges you can

416
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,839
actually use cyber chef to do it you can

417
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,759
do it on on your phone if you want

418
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,639
actually that's how powerful this is um

419
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,680
so if you go to the uh um this is once

420
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,199
you're logged in

421
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,360
uh click on the arrow pointing to the

422
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,759
left on the right hand side

423
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,079
and then go to the challenges

424
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,040
and

425
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,519
if you see the crypto

426
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,839
or the uh

427
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,360
malware the awesome one

428
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,920
those are the uh the files that or the

429
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,279
information that you

430
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,079
uh

431
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,040
you need

432
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,279
if you don't want or

433
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,279
if you don't want to access this because

434
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,040
you don't want to create a new account

435
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
or something like that all you have to

436
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,240
do is click on this uh cyber chef

437
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
challenges and it's basically it's gonna

438
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,519
take you to

439
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,199
uh to download this document which is a

440
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,519
you know

441
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,040
all the challenges that i'm gonna be

442
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,639
discussing so

443
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,639
let me actually let me open that right

444
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,839
now

445
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,519
so you can see what i'm talking about

446
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,160
give me a second

447
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,959
all right

448
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,600
so this right here in case you don't see

449
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,519
it these are the challenges that i was

450
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,519
talking about uh same thing it's just

451
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,480
different ways of doing it right and so

452
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,920
just going through this you're gonna be

453
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,079
able to see that we have an awesome

454
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,839
challenge um cryptography challenge and

455
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,720
as i i discussed cyberchef

456
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,800
the main reason why i think cyberchef

457
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,639
started is because you know there was a

458
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,800
lot of cryptography uh you know uh

459
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,559
challenges out there for ctfs and stuff

460
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,400
like that and they had like many

461
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,959
websites so they obviously wanted to to

462
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,199
to find a way to make it easier and just

463
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,280
in one tool have everything right and

464
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,959
that's the reason why it's called the

465
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,520
swiss army knife um

466
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,119
i can go back to this page but in the

467
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,039
meantime uh let's let's uh um

468
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,160
uh

469
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
uh let me continue with uh the other

470
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,839
stuff

471
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,720
so some of the useful operations in

472
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,440
in cyber chef is obviously as i was

473
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,360
mentioning everything that deals with

474
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,559
encryption or decryption um or encoding

475
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,600
decoding uh it is very helpful

476
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
but not just that what is actually now

477
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,320
the power of cyber chief is is when

478
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
you're doing malware analysis because

479
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,039
now uh the obfuscation that you know

480
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,760
malware is coming with you know it's

481
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,120
it's you know very uh uh

482
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,320
some it's sometimes very difficult to

483
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,840
and and sometimes you have to use many

484
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,080
tools to to get the actual answer to

485
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,960
just to be able to have a malware just

486
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,760
readable right well in this case uh you

487
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,320
can use just one tool to do it and as

488
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,640
i'm gonna show you with a few examples

489
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,559
uh you know you're gonna be able to do

490
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,799
this uh so extractors you can extract

491
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,080
urls ip addresses so before the way you

492
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,720
used to do things is even with log files

493
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,960
right with log files you have to grab

494
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,360
like if you are a command line india you

495
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
used to use to grab things and have to

496
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,760
do regex and stuff like that in order to

497
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,919
find this now everything is like

498
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,760
literally like right there so you don't

499
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,160
have to you know literally do anything

500
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,280
uh the pros and cons obviously

501
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,840
of using storage f over

502
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,120
um

503
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,640
over um

504
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,600
the terminal line is the command line is

505
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,400
that everything's there you have to get

506
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,520
out however it's not as easy and

507
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,679
especially at first it will take you a

508
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,840
long time to just to get around it

509
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,520
because again there's so many features

510
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,960
and there continue

511
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,440
uh upgrading these and updating it with

512
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,679
new features that

513
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,240
you know it's

514
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,160
everything's very uh like you have to

515
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,760
basically come up there in yourselves in

516
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,320
order to keep it up so let me uh

517
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,400
let's see i can hear all right

518
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
so uh yeah so those are some of the

519
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
useful operations and you will see them

520
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,760
once we uh we go to the examples

521
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,720
so um

522
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
building recipes so again i mentioned

523
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,760
that in order to build your recipes you

524
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,520
need ingredients and the ingredients are

525
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
those operations all you have to do

526
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,919
again one option is drag and drop the

527
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,160
other option is uh

528
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
you know there is once you you copy and

529
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,120
paste code into the input area there is

530
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,720
a magic wand that it's basically gonna

531
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,960
give you what i think it is and it's

532
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
gonna make your life easier and i'll

533
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,960
show you that same thing with searching

534
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,480
operations um

535
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,679
well in this case uh ingredients um if

536
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,840
you don't

537
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,400
know

538
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,679
if you don't want to go through the

539
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,760
whole list of of the

540
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
the sections on each of the

541
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,919
operations you can actually use search

542
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,240
for it and it's going to be very easy

543
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,880
and how you share the recipes well

544
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,280
actually sharing recipes is very uh very

545
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,480
easy you can once you have a full recipe

546
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
like going all you have to do is copy

547
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
the full url

548
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,360
on on that recipe and then just send it

549
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,559
that way to to your team the other way

550
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,440
is

551
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,640
by loading recipes

552
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,080
so let me let me show you something

553
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,559
really quick

554
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,799

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,640
where is my other window

600
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,400
i have so many windows open that i don't

601
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,640
know

602
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,240
there is no that's not it

603

here we go

606
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,799
all right so this is the the file that i

607
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,120
downloaded okay

608
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,679
so first one um

609
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,840
so right now as you can see just based

610
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,360
on my let me

611
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,039
zoom in here

612
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,600
i don't know if you can see it

613
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,200
but my

614
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
uh this is a local instance of cyber

615
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,480
chef

616
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,520
i have not updated um you know in the

617
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,440
last two months

618
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,520
the uh the current version is version

619
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,279
9.38 i believe

620
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,960
so again

621
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,080
when they do

622
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,559
updates um they will describe what the

623
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,540
update is either they're um

624
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,679
[Music]

625
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,640
um

626
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,279
you know they're uh

627
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,320
implementing something new a new

628
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,640
operation or sometimes it's just a bug

629
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,200
fix they're trying to fix so if we just

630
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,080
go through the first um actually let me

631
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,520
move this here

632
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
hopefully you're going to be able to see

633
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,120
it and if not that's

634
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,960
i'll make that happen

635
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,559
so

636
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,679
here i have the first uh um challenges

637
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,600
so let's go through the easy one so you

638
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,679
either you you're using the ctf platform

639
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,640
which is

640
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,960
this or you're using

641
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,440
the the the files that i you know that i

642
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,919
told you to

643
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,799
input downl

644
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,480
and uh

645
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,240
i'm just gonna go ahead and paste it in

646
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,480
here

647
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,360
i mentioned that at times uh cyber check

648
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
will give you

649
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,640
a you know

650
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,440
you know an output here like what pus

651
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,880
could possibly be right so uh obviously

652
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,799
in this case it didn't i don't know why

653
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,120
uh maybe because i don't have the latest

654
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,640
one uh but i know this one is binary so

655
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,559
you know if you live in binary you know

656
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,640
it's just once and zero so that's very

657
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
easy so here are your options right the

658
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,000
first option is just just type binary

659
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,440
and then here it's going to give you

660
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,760
basically the different options that you

661
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,159
have for binary right so in this case

662
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,720
i'm going from binary to

663
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
scholastic so i want to know what it

664
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,720
means in plain english right so all i

665
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,200
have to do is you know basically drag

666
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,240
and drop

667
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,360
you know the operations to the recipe

668
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,399
it's gonna take a while

669
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,799
okay

670
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,200
let me

671
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
okay this one's not working give me a

672
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,159
second here

673
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,039
let me refresh this

674
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,720
and that's when again tools

675
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,320
fail so bear with me

676
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,678
okay

677
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
all right let's keep sorry

678
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,679
sorry now so we have um the door that

679
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,520
has a ringer so in case you're hearing

680
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,320
it uh oh i guess someone open the door

681
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,279
so

682
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,760
all right let me

683
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,600
this is the magic one that i was talking

684
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,240
about right so before i i mentioned that

685
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,760
you can drag and drop

686
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
this one all i have to do is press on it

687
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,520
and it actually will move the recipe

688
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,600
from it so the first one you say is not

689
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,080
taking it

690
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,039
it should

691
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,320
now

692
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,480
i have to say that uh when we were

693
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,640
running this um

694
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,880
we were running into

695
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,640
different issues because i guess the

696
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,559
other questions were um

697
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,480
some of them like transferred to like

698
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
all uppercase and some some of them are

699
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,080
like all over case

700
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,440
uh

701
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,120
so in this case like this won't work

702
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,240
yeah yeah i took it yeah so so the first

703
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,679
one like for this one was

704
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,320
yeah uh yeah welcome to your first ctf

705
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,080
yes

706
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,000
really interesting

707
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,919
i think

708
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,840
i

709
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,919
think true

710
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,080
oh really you should admit it it pumps

711
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,520
up and checking

712
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,240
it turns green anyway

713
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,760
oh that's very interesting all right

714
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,720
well

715
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,039
um

716
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,799
that's the flag

717
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,440
so if you don't get it uh that's okay

718
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,600
because that's a flag

719
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,520
all right so let's go to the second one

720
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,279
so let's um so few few items in in cyber

721
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,320
chef here

722
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,440
let me

723
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,720
i hit this

724
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,679
so the best way to to erase this instead

725
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,480
of just reopening a page or something is

726
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,039
just basically clicking the uh the clear

727
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,679
recipe from from this section here and

728
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,159
also there is a trash can in here that

729
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,880
basically basically clears the input and

730
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,440
output right so by doing that that goes

731
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,840
away so now now let's do the the second

732
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,919
challenge which um what what do you

733
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,080
think this is

734
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,840
uh i know some people in the room are

735
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,120
very uh

736
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,520
now about this

737
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,440
okay all right so

738
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,679
from here it says from hex will produce

739
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,159
this so just by clicking that it will

740
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,000
give you the answer which is skip it up

741
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,559
you're doing great right so that's

742
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,919
that's hexadecimal so uh where binary is

743
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,240
just ones and zeros hexadecimals is just

744
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,320
base 16 right so

745
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,600
0 through

746
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,399
9

747
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,320
8 through f that's it all right let's

748
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,480
see

749
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,559
so this one

750
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,320
not many people know about it

751
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,600
uh what do you think this is

752
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,679
without clicking on the button yet what

753
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,919
do you think this is

754
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,159
base64 okay and how do you know it's

755
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,159
base64

756
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,919
different

757
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,039
no because it could be a

758
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,440
you know it could i i'll show you a

759
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,760
challenge where it has like i don't know

760
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,720
how many

761
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,200
lines of code and it's basics for so

762
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,640
there's a few things that you have to

763
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,399
keep in mind when you see

764
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,440
that the two equal signs at the end

765
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,320
more likely that's base 64.

766
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,960
also uh at the beginning

767
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
not not this one in particular but i've

768
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,399
seen a pattern with uh uh

769
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,840
i don't know what's the actual name for

770
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,760
it and i apologize for that i'll look

771
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,600
look it up for you but it's basically

772
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,080
the hex uh the uh the forensic

773
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,240
uh id just like

774
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,159
the uh um

775
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,559
you know the jpegs have like a certain

776
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,799
you know uh it starts with a certain

777
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,159
number or letters uh or or

778
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,640
exts or or so on so on uh

779
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,520
base64 is very particular on that so as

780
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,760
long as he has like a two

781
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,000
or at least one i've seen once through

782
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,120
one equal sign at the end uh that more

783
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,360
likely it's base64 so again we're i'm

784
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,000
gonna use my uh magic one and and yeah

785
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,880
in fact it says from base64 will produce

786
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,000
this

787
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,200
which

788
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,519
you know do not get frustrated it is

789
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,519
part of the learning process right so

790
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,399
that's

791
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,679
uh you know base64

792
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,640
now as we go through the ctf challenge

793
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,960
there's obviously uh you know more

794
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,120
difficult ones like this one for example

795
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,080
this one is it's it's encryption so

796
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,440
unless you're

797
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,679
you you work on that field you will know

798
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,880
what this is uh any

799
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,240
any um

800
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,080
any guesses what this could be

801
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
it's rod yeah

802
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,799
yeah this is rod 13.

803
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,210
here you go so again this is very uh um

804
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,559
[Music]

805
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,159
uh you know

806
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,919
it could be it could look very easy or

807
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,760
frustrating when you look at it first

808
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,519
like what the hell is this and if you

809
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,240
look at it let me let me erase this

810
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,320
you notice that

811
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,679
in the output

812
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:52,799
cyber just

813
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,720
cyber charge didn't help me this time it

814
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,440
didn't give me the uh the magic one

815
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,559
which means

816
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,519
cyber

817
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,880
doesn't really know what it is and

818
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,519
instead of giving you a random answers

819
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,840
it's just going to give you uh you know

820
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,679
uh you know not give you anything

821
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,519
basically at this point so

822
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,760
again if you're familiar with this stuff

823
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,640
uh then you're gonna start you know

824
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,960
uh putting here what you think this is

825
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,880
like for example the gem gel i mean here

826
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,640
it says caesar okay let's let's try

827
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,120
caesar

828
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,679
uh

829
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,080
yeah uh let's see i don't think this one

830
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,799
has this oh cypher they have cipher

831
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,279
decrypt not sure if this is the one but

832
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,159
again

833
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,000
uh the good thing about here is that you

834
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,080
can keep trying different stuff right

835
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,720
and you know you can use one one thing

836
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
that you can use in here is also entropy

837
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,760
which in entropy what basically does

838
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,919
is um

839
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,600
you know it gives you how many letters

840
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,760
it it has and maybe it's just a pattern

841
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,840
a pattern that you have to find and

842
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,600
that's basically another way of

843
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,640
encryption right so um i'm not a i don't

844
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,240
do uh

845
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,000
i don't work with algorithms and i don't

846
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,399
work with uh you know the different uh

847
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,679
encryption

848
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,000
algorithms or anything like that i just

849
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,080
happen to know some of them because as

850
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,559
part of my job i have to know but you

851
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,240
know it's just a learning experience

852
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,720
unless you are dedicated to

853
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,080
to do

854
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,919
you know

855
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,320
this type of algorithms then you're good

856
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,000
to go otherwise you're like you're gonna

857
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,760
be like me you have to be you know

858
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,399
adding stuff to here um if you're

859
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,640
wondering like let's say

860
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,279
how do i remove just one

861
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,519
ingredient from the recipe or operation

862
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,480
in this case

863
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,480
all you have to do is click and drag to

864
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,200
the right and it will disappear right so

865
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
that way you only keep the ones you want

866
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:52,760
so so in this case we we say it's rot13

867
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,600
um also keep in mind that in here

868
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,159
it goes by order of presence so that

869
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,600
they know the

870
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,000
the ones on top will go first and then

871
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,120
the ones

872
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,799
at the bottom will connect

873
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,199
if for whatever reason the ones on top

874
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,119
will not uh

875
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,440
doesn't work or it's not what you want

876
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,079
either you can disable it by clicking

877
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,239
this button which is the disable

878
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,000
operation

879
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,960
or

880
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,520
you can just remove it in general right

881
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,280
so that way the next one is going to

882
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,800
become available or it's actually going

883
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,919
to take the actions from it

884
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,280
all right

885
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,480
yeah actually as a matter of fact for

886
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,119
the the ones who are still catching up

887
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,960
so you know already kind of like the

888
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,639
presentation but as i go through

889
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,239
basically i'm talking what i mentioned

890
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,719
on the slides these are the uh uh the

891
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,639
challenges that i was talking about are

892
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,239
in here so if you wanna i can wait for

893
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,759
you if you want to uh

894
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,520
i don't know this is just for you too

895
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,480
well there is a ctf

896
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,839
oh okay

897
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,960
so there is a ctf so is it the rsa

898
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,599
basediver.net that's where the the the

899
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,520
crypto and the uh um

900
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,720
was the other one the awesome one

901
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,040
it was available right

902
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,599
so yeah for the gentleman in the back uh

903
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,440
let me go back

904
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,400
uh

905
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,560
those are the uh uh actually it's right

906
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,359
here um so those are the uh

907
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,920
the the uh the platforms uh what i will

908
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,680
suggest if you don't wanna create an

909
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,800
account in rsa that basecyber.net just

910
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,400
go ahead and download the challenges

911
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,599
which it gives you this uh note uh uh

912
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,560
um

913
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,160
which has all the challenges that we're

914
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,000
going through right now so like like i

915
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,320
said i can wait for you so go ahead

916
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,280
um

917
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,200
i ask a question

918
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,320
sure what is the little pause button um

919
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,599
that's above

920
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,920
the ingredient for example like on

921
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,320
um on cyber chef

922
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,160
this one oh i'm sorry yeah like if you

923
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,720
pulled up rot 13 yeah the little paws

924
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,359
what's that mean it basically um

925
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,599
it's it's also the same thing as if

926
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,400
you're

927
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,320
turning it off it's it doesn't really

928
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,560
like it just skips it basically that

929
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,640
that's what it is now this one it

930
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,560
completely turns it off where this one

931
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,160
you can pause it like

932
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,400
if you want to keep it enabled but you

933
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,200
don't want to use it like in this first

934
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,240
round um since i'm here also

935
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,079
i want to mention one thing

936
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,480
as you notice as i was inputting things

937
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
and i was adding operations to the

938
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,240
recipe

939
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,400
they were out of baking

940
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,040
um so and that's the risk the reason why

941
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,720
is because the auto bake is on the

942
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,280
bottom right it's and it's select

943
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,920
for files that are very large in size

944
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,760
and i will show you a few

945
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,280
it's not recommended to to to

946
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,960
do the auto bake otherwise it's going to

947
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,520
take a while okay so like in the example

948
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,599
that or the question that uh i'm not

949
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,079
sure who asked it uh for the uh the

950
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,800
pause uh you know that's if you don't

951
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,200
have the auto bake enable

952
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,760
you can you can manually bake it as you

953
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,240
go so if you want to skip it one time

954
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,960
you can you know just uh basically uh

955
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,400
basically it's just gonna be an escape

956
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,480
button where the other one is just gonna

957
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,200
disable it completely

958
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,880
so that's that's basically the

959
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,839
difference

960
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,440
any other questions on the other side

961
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
sorry i'm

962
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,119
let me see if i have more questions on

963
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,690
the chat

964
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,170
[Music]

965
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,680
uh

966
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,399
on the desktop

967
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
any any other questions on on the other

968
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,640
side

969
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,560
if you have questions

970
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,720
please uh try to post them in the uh the

971
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,200
chat and i'll i'll try to see the chat

972
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,320
as

973
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,000
as

974
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,440
early as possible so

975
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,640
yeah so we have a uh assume that you

976
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,000
know you can join uh but

977
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,720
so the the meetup uh on so we posted the

978
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,920
zoom link

979
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,440
the the um

980
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,680
on the same day of the meetup so earlier

981
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,000
i i pasted the uh

982
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,400
you know the link for for some

983
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,640
and we do it for two reasons one because

984
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,720
i forget before

985
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,359
so i you know i know i'm i have to do it

986
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,160
like on the saturday so one and two

987
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,720
because obviously we want you know the

988
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,520
uh you know people to come in and and

989
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
and you know learn right so that's the

990
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,560
other reason um you know

991
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,680
uh to do it so but yeah if if you see

992
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
the uh that is more convenient for you

993
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,240
to to do it remotely you know we we

994

rsa and we use this platform

1004
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,839
at rsa so that's why it's called

1005
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:01,599
rsa.cyber.net because that's a password

1006
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,680
that's the platform that we use for that

1007
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,680
and it was just a basic ctf as you can

1008
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,480
see you can play it uh you for the ones

1009
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,760
that came in late we're gonna have a ctf

1010
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,760
uh two ctf events uh next month uh

1011
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,720
uh july 15th it's gonna be the uh nft

1012
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,839
ctf and i'll i'll i'll put this in here

1013
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,119
um so ain't chine it's it's a crypto

1014
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,160
company

1015
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,079
and and they're gonna cre they're gonna

1016
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,319
have a uh nft ctf

1017
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,800
that is in hackers that

1018
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,160
oh good

1019

so we hope to see you there and then on

1020
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,280
on july 29th uh we're going to have a

1021
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,079
joint event with uh wises uh the local

1022
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,200
chapter and we're going to have um

1023
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,640
multiple ctfs uh not just the uh the rsa

1024
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,440
one uh we're gonna have cryptoctf we're

1025
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,640
gonna have a wireshark ctf uh we're

1026
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,599
gonna have just a bunch of ctfs and also

1027
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,319
we're gonna have uh the no quarter ctf

1028
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,640
if you win uh for that one obviously

1029
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,480
we're still working on the details

1030
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,280
but if you win that one as a solo player

1031
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,480
you get to uh go to rsa i'm sorry you

1032
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,760
get to uh go to a defcon with a free

1033
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,599
ticket basically so that's the price

1034
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,040
free ticket to defcon okay so uh more

1035
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,119
into that but uh we'll we'll discuss

1036
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,119
that um

1037
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,040
on on on the meeting um are you able sir

1038
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,880
were you able to download the other file

1039
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,200
and look at the challenges

1040
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,640
um jill i'm in the back

1041
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,400
um

1042
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,160
were you able to uh download the

1043
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,359
challenges that i was uh

1044
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,440
oh okay okay

1045
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,200
yeah if you just go to this link right

1046
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,599
here the bitly

1047
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,400
that's

1048
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,599
the file that you need right now

1049
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,439
yeah let me um

1050
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,079
okay so user is having a blink blink uh

1051
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,839
yeah actually let me go into that

1052
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,200
because apparently um

1053
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,560
the the users at the ctf also had uh

1054
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,560
issues so let me let me see that

1055
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,760
um let me go over that one and

1056
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,480
for

1057
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,880
i'm just gonna paste the the files again

1058
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,800
in case

1059
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,200
uh you guys need it so the rsa ctf

1060
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,240
that's

1061
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,319
you can use the platform by the way this

1062
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,800
is for only two the first two challenges

1063
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,520
because after that where as you can see

1064
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,520
are different stuff uh that is not going

1065
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,920
to be on the rsa ctf so my

1066
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,800
recommendation is um you know just

1067
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,960
don't uh

1068
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,200
don't spend much time on the rsa that

1069
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,520
basecyber.net because we're gonna be

1070
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,640
moving on on on the other challenges uh

1071
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,319
the last challenges

1072
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,240
if you look at through the bottom

1073
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,800
uh these are actually malware uh

1074
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,079
so my advice giving you right now

1075
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,560
do not copy and paste this

1076
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
paste it into notepad

1077
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,200
and change the uh the extension from

1078
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,960
from that txt to that exe because that

1079
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,839
is actually malware so um

1080
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,040
now it's in in a way that it's not uh

1081
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
executable or anything like that it's

1082
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,960
just we want to do malware analysis on

1083
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,920
it right

1084
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,280
so but just as an fyi and i'll repeat

1085
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,599
this again once we uh

1086
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,000
we get there

1087
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,839
yeah see if you download the uh cyber

1088
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,240
chef challenges that's that's the other

1089
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,959
one we're going to be using

1090
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,839
okay yeah that's

1091
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,839
fine all right so all right the next one

1092
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,079
uh the next next one was

1093
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,000
uh uh challenge number five on

1094
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,200
on the um

1095
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,640
on the rsa challenge and also the prom

1096
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,200
and also on the server

1097
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,160
chef challenges in this case it gave me

1098
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,640
the uh the the morse code but just by

1099
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,880
well i already mentioned it so where do

1100
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,640
you normally see more school obviously

1101
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,359
it's in the military right um

1102
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,040
uh they make you learn

1103
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,839
yeah

1104
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,040
here you go

1105
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,880
they make you learn that in case you are

1106
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,440
um you know became a

1107
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,119
prisoner of war or pow and you uh uh you

1108
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,160
wanna send a message encrypted uh and i

1109
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,480
don't know if you ever saw um

1110
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,280
there is this uh pow from uh

1111
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,839
vietnam

1112
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,400
who he was giving giving an interview by

1113
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,240
you know the

1114
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,480
i don't know how it was i remember

1115
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,880
correctly but basically he was blinking

1116
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,599
with the eyes and that was the message

1117
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,440
so the message obviously was help but he

1118
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,160
was able to to create a

1119
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,359
link link

1120
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,839
something like that you know this

1121
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,319
closing the eyes meant uh it was just

1122
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,440
the line uh so uh something like that

1123
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,319
and then

1124
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,079
you know something like this and then

1125
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,359
close one close to so there's many ways

1126
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,000
also um when i was in the military that

1127
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,960
that was something i had to learn

1128
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,480
so let's say that we were like in two

1129
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,400
different rooms you know you can do the

1130
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,240
same thing with with tabs so that's why

1131
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,680
i said tap tap

1132
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,200
and then tap

1133
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,800
then you can hear the difference and

1134
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,359
they make you remember that because

1135
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,760
again if you become prisoner of war you

1136
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,800
know

1137
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,520
that becomes useful did i actually learn

1138
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,960
it no no i did not um

1139
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,760
uh i was not in a combat position uh so

1140
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,319
i i didn't think it was necessary

1141
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,720
because i said you know um i can do

1142
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,280
encryption you know basic encryption in

1143
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,920
in the computer so

1144
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,880
anyways long story short i i do not know

1145
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,240
uh um

1146
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,599
uh

1147
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,319
morse code by by heart but there's

1148
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,440
people who

1149
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,960
especially special forces who basically

1150
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,760
uh

1151
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,160
they they go through a whole test

1152
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,560
and and talk in morse code you know just

1153
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,000
for that

1154
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,319
all right

1155
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,560
correct yeah that's the reason why so

1156
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,520
when like let's say they were on sales

1157
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,000
like that was how we were supposed to to

1158
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,480
do it like

1159
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,839
flashes too doesn't have to be audio

1160
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,680
that's right right uh

1161
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,160
yeah same thing yeah so different ways

1162
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,040
again

1163
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,440
it's just basically if you look at it

1164
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,440
from this perspective it's just binary

1165
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,520
right you know ones and zeros you know

1166
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,760
it's all it's either on or it's off but

1167
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,000
then how you're you know doing it it's

1168
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,280
you know how it

1169
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,599
translates to to something right

1170
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,119
and obviously it's not that you're gonna

1171
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,200
have a whole conversation but

1172
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,760
mainly it was for like are you okay

1173
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,559
uh i i need help or uh or something

1174
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,480
along the line like short messages it's

1175
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,440
not like giving a whole conversation but

1176
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,720
the the basic meaning was to to

1177
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,119
to talk to others and tell them oh i'm

1178
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,920
alive or i'm not okay or i'm sick or

1179
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,400
something like that

1180
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,680
yeah exactly so definitely if you're um

1181
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,440
same thing with sign language i mean

1182
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,359
we're differing from the topic but same

1183
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,880
thing with sign language

1184
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,800
i see many commercials with a little

1185
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,720
girl giving a you know i don't remember

1186
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,559
if something like this

1187
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,920
something like that means it's like they

1188
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,680
need help

1189
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,680
yeah the help sign

1190
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,880
yeah yeah

1191
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,240
so so look at that because that's that's

1192
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,720
similar to this it's just code that

1193
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,400
people will not understand unless you

1194
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,200
know so if you learn those type of codes

1195
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,040
might save your life so don't don't

1196
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,520
discard that because it might save your

1197
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,480
life believe it or not

1198
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,720
exactly

1199
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,440
oh yeah i saw that the other day

1200
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,920
you guys care about it or no

1201
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,960
so there was this girl who was

1202
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,440
when i said like girl girl like

1203
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,559
minor per se but she she was young

1204
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,280
she was basically kidnapped by the the

1205
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,000
boyfriend the boyfriend did not

1206
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,920
allow her to talk to the outside took

1207
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,839
away from her phone

1208
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,400
the uh so the only time that she was

1209
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,480
allowed to use the phone was to use door

1210
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,520
dash

1211
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,960
so on door dash she basically

1212
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,400
uh put a

1213
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,839
place an order

1214
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,640
and in the notes you know to the driver

1215
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,640
or to the the in this case the other

1216
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,680
company

1217
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,680
uh the restaurant

1218
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,119
basically said

1219
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,079
i'm kidnapped uh i need help please call

1220
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,280
the police

1221
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,720
so

1222
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,280
so and this was in new york

1223
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,480
basically what happened uh the

1224
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,119
the cook at the uh or whoever got the

1225
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,319
order

1226
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,960
at five o'clock in the morning

1227
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,800
she didn't know what to do so she called

1228
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,880
the owner and say what do you want me to

1229
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,880
do and say call the police

1230
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,599
so

1231
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:46,880
when

1232
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,800
so obviously at this point that the the

1233
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,160
boyfriend

1234
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,280
uh

1235
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,599
was expecting the the driver to come in

1236
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,280
so when

1237
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,559
they knocked on the door he opened the

1238
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,480
door it wasn't the driver it was the

1239
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,440
police

1240
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,599
they were able to basically save her and

1241
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,839
that same boyfriend also kidnapped

1242
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,400
another person another girl

1243
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,480
so they opened an investigation but

1244
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,400
so now just using tools that we're

1245
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,480
having to available to us it's just as

1246
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,520
simple as doordash can save your life so

1247
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,359
again keep that in mind because you know

1248
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,240
it's a real thing so

1249
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,119
you know what that that actually

1250
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,960
surprised me but but again uh she

1251
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,200
you know make the selection

1252
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,880
and place the order and once the order

1253
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,720
goes um

1254
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,079
unless you like

1255
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:44,960
like

1256
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,400
you know see what you order the history

1257
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,000
more likely but you know it was five

1258
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,599
o'clock in the morning

1259
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,280
i i think it was just like oh here

1260
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,559

1263
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,800

1264
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800

1271
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,960
texting i'm just seeing you that you're

1272
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,200
swiping right you know what i'm saying

1273
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
like for replacing the order and i'm

1274
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,640
pushing like not like your texting but

1275
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,480
the minimal like you could do on your

1276
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,520
phone like

1277
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,000
not for communication right so anyways

1278
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,880
uh

1279
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,800
okay hold on i mean

1280
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,079
my battery is about to die

1281
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,960
otherwise i'm gonna lose everybody here

1282
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,680
give me a second

1283
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,480
okay all right cool

1284
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,000
all right so moving on so for the

1285
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,559
question that user had about having

1286
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,280
problems with the number five

1287
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,760
if it's not working all capitals try

1288
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,760
just the upper case on each letter like

1289
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,680
m c i

1290
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,319
c and and all that see if that works if

1291
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,760
it doesn't work

1292
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,319
otherwise again just remember that

1293
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,640
this is just for practice just happen to

1294
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,720
get those questions and you know we're

1295
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,319
we're using them for for for the

1296
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,480
workshop but you know that's it all

1297
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,559
right so i'm gonna move on uh so the

1298
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,880
cyber challenges

1299
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,200
i am going to um

1300
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,359
uh let's see select this

1301
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:21,660
um

1302
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,960
[Music]

1303
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,119
now i'm gonna give you a heads up right

1304
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:27,280
now so this one was a

1305
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,520
uh

1306
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,319
interview question

1307
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,640
and and uh

1308
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,480
i um

1309
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,400
the question was you know basically what

1310
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
is the source and destination ip and all

1311
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,160
that when i start seeing this

1312
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,680
automatically if you come from the

1313
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,920
networking background you are a

1314
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,760
mathematically thing is like oh this is

1315
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,960
like uh

1316
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,440
tcp you know uh

1317
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,400
you know

1318
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,040
and

1319
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,119
basically that's what i'm trying to look

1320
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,359
for so then you can start searching for

1321
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:02,160
tcp ip checksum or or do uh um what was

1322
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,760
the other one um

1323
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,080
network

1324
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,520
[Music]

1325
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,880

1329
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,559

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,480
so let me move this

1332
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,119
and you can see here that uh this is

1333
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,000
just

1334
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,920
a snippet of it but it gives you the

1335
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,440
information here right so what is the

1336
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,000
source and destination ip well here is

1337
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,599
right so let me make that

1338
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,160
uh so those are the uh the ips that you

1339
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,319
have i remember you actually asked for

1340
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,720
the other source on this uh destination

1341
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,440
port but that's basically how you get it

1342
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,440
um

1343
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,119
decimal dom this is another one and this

1344
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:03,319
one is actually very interesting

1345
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,640
so

1346
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,920
this one

1347
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,599
so first of all what do you think this

1348
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,000
is because this is not an easy easy

1349
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
question

1350
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,359
well it's

1351
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,559
actually it's in decimal format okay not

1352
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,799
not

1353
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:43,839
okay

1354
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,280
so

1355
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,839
i'm gonna load so see how i loaded the

1356
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:51,119
uh the recipe this is a recipe i created

1357
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:52,400
for this

1358
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,760
and i'm going to cancel everything

1359
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,040
because i want to go through every

1360
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,079
single step in here

1361
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,000
so

1362
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,640
from from decimal this is obviously

1363
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,240
decimal

1364
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,240
you know you want to go from decimal and

1365
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,640
it gives you this right

1366
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,280
so in here just by looking at it like i

1367
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,559
mentioned before

1368
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,400
sometimes it has just

1369
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,040
uh one equal sign or two equal sign

1370
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,280
that more likely tells you that that's

1371
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,160
base 64. so at that point you enable

1372
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,079
base64

1373
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,760
and you get more of this and you are

1374
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,400
like what the heck is this like this is

1375
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,559
this is not english like

1376
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,200
okay what am i i have to do here there

1377
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,880
is a option in in cyber chef

1378
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,720
that is called um

1379
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,160
extract files

1380
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,240
and by extracting files

1381
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,160
more likely you'll find the answer you

1382
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,240
can click on every single one and in

1383
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,000
fact we're gonna go through the whole

1384
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,799
thing

1385
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:54,000
if you use click let's say

1386
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,720
images

1387
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,280
it will say it's zero files

1388
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,880
let's try video

1389
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,240
zero files

1390
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,359
audio

1391
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,119
zero files

1392
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,680
documents zero files

1393
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,960
applications

1394
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,280
zero files archives

1395
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,000
oh okay i got an error sometimes this

1396
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,599
type of errors that doesn't mean it's

1397
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:18,720
not

1398
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,520
uh

1399
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,760
it's not a bad thing it just means that

1400
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,480
it might need something else in here to

1401
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,480
extract it so like for example ignore

1402
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,280
fail extractions what if i do that here

1403
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,240
you go becomes available okay

1404
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,640
so this is a zip file okay

1405
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,839
normally

1406
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,359
what i used to do is download this file

1407
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,760
you can just click in this and download

1408
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,440
the file and extract it and see what's

1409
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,720
the contents

1410
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,720
but you don't have to do that anymore in

1411
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,280
here because there is an unzip portion

1412
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,079
so by doing that all i have to do is

1413
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,240
you know enable it right

1414
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,559
and there is a file here called a

1415
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,480
now you're thinking okay

1416
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,040
how am i gonna see the uh the the file

1417
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,960
what's inside the file

1418
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,319
well there is

1419
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,720
just like in the terminal there is head

1420
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,119
and tails just to to see what's the at

1421
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,240
the top or the bottom of the the file

1422
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,359
you can use you can search for hat

1423
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,760
drag it

1424
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,000
and it will tell you like the first you

1425
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,880
know

1426
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,240
the head

1427
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,799
if you just want to see the uh

1428
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,040
the bottom of it which in this case is

1429
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,480
small file so it doesn't really matter

1430
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,640
but you want to see the the

1431
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,040
bottom part of it you can just drag it

1432
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,640
and in this case we'll give you the same

1433
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,520
thing but if it's a longer file you know

1434
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,079
then you can use it so from here you

1435
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,480
know again it's basically four

1436
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,319
i just want to know so the app the

1437
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,280
questions that i i put in here are

1438
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,200
um let's see

1439
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,160
what's

1440
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,480
inside the question

1441
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,559
uh

1442
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,880
what basically what are the questions

1443
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,920
so now that i know this is base64 i can

1444
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,160
enable the basics before and here are

1445
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,480
the questions and i said bonus what is

1446
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,760
the correct answer

1447
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,000
so what's the correct answer if anyone

1448
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,880
wants to give it a try

1449
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,160
and you can google it that's fine

1450
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,920
i need to ask them what's

1451
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,920
no no no what's that we already passed

1452
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,200
the zip file

1453
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,119
what's the uh uh what's inside the c

1454
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,760
file there is a file

1455
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,470
yeah and then um there is a um

1456
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,160
[Music]

1457
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,319
okay someone in in the chat says d

1458
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,799
does everybody agree with d

1459
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,720
which is kerberos

1460
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,079
so the the

1461
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,440
um the question inside the a file

1462
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,640
or inside the a file there's a base64

1463
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,760
encoded

1464
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,880
question

1465
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,200
after recording it it's basically this

1466
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,720
question which is

1467
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,319
which of the following attacks will

1468
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,280
allow an attacker to recover plain text

1469
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,440
password for service accounts

1470
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,839
so some someone in the chat says the

1471
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:11,680
uh everybody agree with you okay cool

1472
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,000
it is

1473
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,920
unless there's a really strong password

1474
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,520
right

1475
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,720
here you go

1476
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,400
i have your answer for that sorry go

1477
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,559
ahead

1478
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,400
your download files

1479
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:34,400
yes so good point so

1480
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,200
right so good point so again uh as i i'm

1481
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,119
going through the uh the malware stuff

1482
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,799
which actually that's where we're going

1483
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:41,599
to

1484
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,520
uh um

1485
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,680
first rule of things obviously i'm doing

1486
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,359
it here because i know this is um

1487
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,880
safe

1488
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,839
ish

1489
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:55,599
which means i'm not detonating it

1490
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,319
but i'm just showing you to see what

1491
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,079
it's inside those files or what is

1492
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,440
inside the the obfuscation and you know

1493
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,559
on that particular malware uh

1494
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,720
but that being said uh

1495
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,960
uh best practices is if you're gonna be

1496
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,960
doing this type of analysis you're gonna

1497
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,200
be doing in a sandbox environment where

1498
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,160
you can you know

1499
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:20,480
right

1500
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,559
no not even the computer but virtual

1501
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,559
machine you know that's it or you have

1502
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,640
an actual computer who

1503
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,480
that you don't use for anything else

1504
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,680
other than

1505
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,960
you know ctfs or or

1506
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,200
whatever you know then then you can use

1507
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,000
that

1508
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,680
all right so now we're actually going to

1509
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,440
the fun stuff why

1510
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,000
cyber chef is becoming like that thing

1511
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,079
uh so we're not at this point we're not

1512
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,680
using the uh the ctf uh the base cyber

1513
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,240
uh ctf anymore if you want to continue

1514
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,480
with that more than welcome uh we're

1515
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,520
gonna have that back on july 29th so um

1516
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,520
so at least you're ahead of the game uh

1517
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,960
you're still gonna get a price for that

1518
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,119
one it's just not gonna be the uh

1519
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,480
the uh defcon tickets so anyways all

1520
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,599
right so

1521
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,920
exercise number one on on malware

1522
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,839
analysis

1523
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:12,880
so

1524
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,680
this is very common by the way uh so

1525
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,839
if you don't know what i

1526
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,920
what i where i currently work is an mdr

1527
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,960
solution

1528
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,799
and i provide uh you know i do triage on

1529
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:28,799
customers environments for uh events uh

1530
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,119
that the edr gets and

1531
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,240
a lot of

1532
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,960
the events or i wanna say at least forty

1533
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,680
percent of the events i get are

1534
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,799
powershell

1535
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:39,680
with

1536
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,359
basically this

1537
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:43,280
basic command

1538
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,799
which means you know this is a

1539
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,799
powershell command

1540
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,319
these are some of the parameters with

1541
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,079
execution bypass

1542
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,640
and again more parameters now you want

1543
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,839
to know what this is okay so i have a i

1544
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,760
already have a uh a recipe for this

1545
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,960
because there is many things that you

1546
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,880
want to take in consideration here all

1547
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,920
right

1548
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,880
so the first one is and let me turn

1549
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,000
everything

1550
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,319
off

1551
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,400
when

1552
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,319
i mentioned before on the presentation

1553
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,240
that ray x is going to be your best

1554
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,599
friend in here

1555
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,520
when you have something

1556
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,520
um

1557
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,039
like this

1558
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,400
and if you just

1559
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,520
turn on like the from base64

1560
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,039
sometimes this

1561
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,280
might or might not work because it has

1562
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,599
some information here so what you want

1563
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,039
to do is separate that right

1564
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,119
and there is many advanced ways to do it

1565
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,440
but the best way of doing it in this

1566
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,480
case is

1567
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,039
just create a regex

1568
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,799
where basically you're looking for

1569
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,240
anything that is supposed to be

1570
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,440
characters

1571
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,760
uh you know and that's basically the

1572
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,240
only thing that you're gonna decode okay

1573
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:54,960
so

1574
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,480
once you do that

1575
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,520
um

1576
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,160
you can hide well by default it becomes

1577
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,000
highlight mask matches match

1578
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,280
matches but in this case all you want is

1579
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,319
list matches which in this case if you

1580
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:09,760
see the difference

1581
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,440
with highlighting matches

1582
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,079
matches it gives you still the uh

1583
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,039
the process or yeah the executable the

1584
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,280
parameters and all that and highlights

1585
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,079
the base64 encoded

1586
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,039
but if you only do list matches

1587
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,280
then it only highlights or actually

1588
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,680
displays the other basics before at that

1589
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,760
point you want to do

1590
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,799
you know continue with your

1591
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,760
investigation right so now i can enable

1592
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,799
from base64 okay so now you decode it

1593
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,720
and you're like okay what is this

1594
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,480
everything has a lot of thoughts you

1595
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,559
know it's not repeatable

1596
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,640
what are the uh the next steps in here

1597
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,960
well there's two options

1598
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,039
um

1599
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,240
again

1600
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,119
one option doesn't work all the time

1601
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,280
just like the other right you just have

1602
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,760
to keep playing until it becomes

1603
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,799
readable

1604
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,240
when i see this type of stuff

1605
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,920
automatically it's like oh i have to

1606
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,000
decode the text so in this case i'm

1607
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,359
going to decode it with the utf-16le

1608
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,200
and as you can see

1609
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,760
uh it becomes readable so it gets rid of

1610
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,680
all the uh the dots and the extra

1611
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,920
characters that you don't need

1612
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,240
to make it readable right

1613
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,599
but just

1614
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,359
when you

1615
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,760
add the the code text automatically is

1616
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,480
going to come with the utf-8

1617
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,760
and then from there you have to

1618
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,280
basically click

1619
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,480
and click

1620
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,559
and click until you find you know the

1621
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,240
one that you

1622
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,839
basically works right which it's tedious

1623
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,640
uh the other easy way and again it

1624
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,720
doesn't work all the time but most of

1625
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,000
the time works it's removing null bytes

1626
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,160
which is basically doing the same thing

1627
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,319
just removing extra characters that you

1628
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,920
don't need and now this is this is it

1629
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,559
okay so bonus questions here so if this

1630
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,480
is a ctf so

1631
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,720
in this case this is part of my work all

1632
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,760
right so um

1633
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,799
and if i have to make a block

1634
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:11,839
to

1635
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,039
to

1636
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:14,799
you know to

1637
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,039
on a firewall or i have to provide that

1638
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,359
to a customer

1639
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,920
all they want to know is give me the

1640
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,880
site

1641
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,000
so

1642
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,599
instead of me going in here and

1643
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,920
highlighting it that obviously takes

1644
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,039
time so there is actually an url

1645
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,599
extract

1646
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,880
which basically

1647
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,720
extract the rails

1648
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,280
which basically all it's going to do is

1649
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,200
extract the url

1650
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,839
for you that's it

1651
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,760
it obviously has options you can display

1652
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,960
how many

1653
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,920
urls found on the malware

1654
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,240
if it has multiple you know you can

1655
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,119
store them out by alpha vertical and how

1656
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,200
many how many are unique because again

1657
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,640
maybe it's just calling the same command

1658
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,319
and control center

1659
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:03,760
but

1660
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,960
you know you just want to make sure how

1661
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,599
many are unique right these are the urls

1662
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:08,640
all right

1663
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,440
so

1664
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,240
now

1665
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,319
let's say that you want to share this

1666
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,119
if i share this on an email

1667
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,359
what does or worth or

1668
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,240
or any any products what will it happen

1669
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,359
if i copy pay copy and paste this into a

1670
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,839
document

1671
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,160
well no but now this is just copying to

1672
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,480
into into words

1673
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,359
what will it happen

1674
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:36,710
sure

1675
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:39,520
[Music]

1676
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,799
there you go

1677
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:43,039
it become a hyperlink

1678
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,359
how do i how do i make it not to become

1679
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:46,480
a hyperloop

1680
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,599
well i can define it

1681
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,720
hey

1682
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,280
so by defining it it means it's taking

1683
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,160
away

1684
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,880
the the characters that makes it uh you

1685
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,760
know uh an active uh hyperlink right

1686
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,680
in this case so let me turn it off so

1687
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,160
you can see the before and after right

1688
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,119
so you will see the http

1689
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,839
you will see the dots you will see you

1690
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:15,440
know a bunch of stuff there

1691
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,400
by defining it it's going to act as like

1692
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,599
instead of http will be hxxb

1693
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,599
which we we know it's not a a protocol

1694
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,440
it will have a

1695
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,359
you know the square brackets around the

1696
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:30,720
uh the dots

1697
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,640
uh you know it will make it for you so

1698
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,119
now this is actually safe to just like

1699
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,599
basically copy and paste it into words

1700
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,640
and that's not going to make it

1701
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,400
hyperlink so that's a good way um in

1702
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,319
this particular

1703
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,799
case there's no um i don't think there

1704
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,880
was uh probably there's gonna be more

1705
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,400
in a future one no i did have some

1706
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,240
questions there by the way this was

1707
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,599
another um

1708
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,920
question

1709
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,230
for

1710
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:01,520
[Music]

1711
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,240
actually you know what

1712
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,919
if you correct the um

1713
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:11,599
for that particular question um i think

1714
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,760
there's a separation like there is a

1715
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,720
enter

1716
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,520
so

1717
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,040
continue

1718
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,198
with that there is more information so

1719
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:20,158
um

1720
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:21,759
not sure what what you're using but

1721
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:22,799
basically

1722
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:26,080
in mind you have to copy line 70

1723
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,839
and 971

1724
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,279
and that and you know just go ahead and

1725
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,439
paste it and then it gives you like more

1726
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:33,040
information here so it was just

1727
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,238
separated

1728
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,319
in case you run into trouble but in this

1729
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,158
case it doesn't give me an ip address

1730
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,040
so

1731
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,520
you know we can we can call that good

1732
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,719
all right

1733
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,479
all right so next one

1734
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,479
exercise number two oh actually the

1735
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,960
questions for this particular one is

1736
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,679
what encoded mechanism was uh used here

1737
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,279
well in this case it was uh base64 right

1738
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,439
um

1739
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,120
and then what is the url uh uh

1740
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,880
you know for this script well we know

1741
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,920
it's this one the bad side.com

1742
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,759
and then what is the name of the files

1743
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,439
that he was trying to use well in this

1744
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,359
case you have to go back

1745
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,040
and basically look at the files that it

1746
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,439
was trying to use right so then

1747
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,158
you can get an idea of what is that all

1748
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:21,600
right

1749
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,159
let's see

1750
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:26,560
all right cool

1751
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,600
let's do number two

1752
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:42,560
so then i have another recipe that it

1753
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,880
was already that i created because again

1754
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,480
it's it's just a lot um

1755
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,679
and by the way

1756
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,679
at the end i'm going to provide you with

1757
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,120
all the recipes that i created

1758
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,280
in fact

1759
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,880
how about well now i don't want to spoil

1760
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,640
it yet so

1761
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,719
well just let's just that

1762
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,880
you're gonna um

1763
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,239
uh

1764
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,960
uh we're gonna do that at the end okay

1765
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,760
so here same thing uh

1766
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,520
what you want to do is

1767
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,600
create a um

1768
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,199
you know

1769
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:22,320
uh

1770
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,360
from 864 but you also want another ray x

1771
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,320
right it's a regular expression and

1772
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,360
as i put it in here in the tips um

1773
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,120
you know this is the one that you need

1774
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,400
to use for

1775
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,080
for base64 because that's the one you

1776
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,480
want right so if you have those handy

1777
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,400
you know it will make your life easier

1778
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,320
um

1779
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,199
here

1780
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,320
so here you go so first again just

1781
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,560
to go back what i what i did

1782
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,840
first i i list the matches so

1783
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,000
that way i don't have the powershell

1784
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,280
that dash e which is encoded uh and then

1785
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,600
uh i just highlight i list the matches

1786
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,280
for that so it's just that

1787
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,000
i basically for it so same thing gives

1788
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,520
me a lot of dots so removing null bytes

1789
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,320
uh you know obviously

1790
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,560
um it's going to remove a lot of the the

1791
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,520
dots

1792
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,920
but what's going on here well

1793
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,080
there is a lot of like

1794
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,320
concatenation you know so a lot of

1795
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,120
pluses a lot of uh dashes so the best

1796
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,520
way of doing it here is find and replace

1797
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,320
and normally you will do this on a you

1798
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,040
know

1799
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,920
notepad or or something like that

1800
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,040
um

1801
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,080
so

1802
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,520
but you have to do that because you can

1803
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,920
do it in here and as you can see the

1804
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,760
progress as you go so

1805
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,640
uh to make the the the live showing in

1806
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,440
this particular one i had a lot of final

1807
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,360
replays for the different stuff that i

1808
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,040
found and i basically i was just copying

1809
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,679
and pasting from directly from here to

1810
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:56,719
the the find and replace make sure that

1811
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,120
when you do find and replace by default

1812
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,600
comes as a regex make sure that you

1813
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,360
change it to simple string because

1814
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,880
that's basically

1815
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,840
you know

1816
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,360
uh it's not going to use the radix

1817
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,040
operation it's going to be a normal one

1818
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,159
so

1819
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:17,280
so i i kept doing it until i found

1820
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,560
uh you know more readable

1821
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,520
so after let's see one

1822
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,440
two three four five six

1823
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,080
after six final replaces

1824
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,239
i was able to make it more readable and

1825
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,800
i still as you can see there is

1826
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,679
uh the uh

1827
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,960
stills very uh um you know

1828
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,280
not really good okay so there's two

1829
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,120
options that you can do here you can do

1830
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,159
beautify code

1831
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:51,199
uh generic code beautify

1832
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,960
and see if it gives you something which

1833
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,800
in this case it does

1834
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,400
because sometimes still there is a lot

1835
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,040
of information or you can just split it

1836
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,600
in this case if you want the uh

1837
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,360
actually i'm gonna show you something so

1838
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,880
if i do extract urls look what happens

1839
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,760
it doesn't give me the urls by you know

1840
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,960
by line

1841
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,320
it's just basically things that it's

1842
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,800
just one big url but as you just going

1843
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,080
through this

1844
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,960
there's many https right so like if i

1845
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,840
say how many uh display the total there

1846
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,960
is one because it's taken as only one

1847
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,920
right

1848
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,440
but if you

1849
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,760
split it by by in this case the

1850
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,400
separation is a asterisk

1851
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,679
then

1852
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,080
it becomes different ones right so like

1853
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,920
without extracting it

1854
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,600
you can do the split and you can see

1855
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,159
that the uh within the code

1856
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:45,440
right it's uh it's gonna be uh one by

1857
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,520
one right and then to make it just

1858
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,199
easier uh just extracted the url

1859
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:54,000
before with without extra explaining it

1860
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,400
was just one right so now if i do

1861
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,679
display total now there is seven bad uh

1862
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,560
ips are urls right in this particular

1863
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,199
one how many are unique it looks like

1864
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:07,600
all of them are unique so the the seven

1865
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,520
were unique

1866
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,440
you can sort it as i mentioned and here

1867
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,840
you go now here is sorted out not sure

1868
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,080
how though uh oh okay it looks like

1869
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,480
https it should be okay

1870
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,159
cool

1871
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:22,880
so that's just another way um the next

1872
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,480
exercise oh you have a question sorry

1873
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,360
oh here

1874
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,560
right here

1875
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:34,320
there is an operation called split

1876
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,320
yeah

1877
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,559
yeah

1878
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,679
all right

1879
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:40,560
so

1880
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,280
again if you you're behind or something

1881
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,440
um start playing with it especially

1882
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,120
because i don't want to take your whole

1883
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,360
afternoon uh just wanna

1884
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,800
i just wanna make sure that you you

1885
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,960
you you have really good content because

1886
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,280
this is literally something that you can

1887
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,840
take at your workplace and apply it so

1888
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,800
um so next exercise is example number or

1889
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,280
exercise number three

1890
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,759
let's see here

1891
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:13,920
and

1892
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,800
of course i had a question there so

1893
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,400
you don't have to answer it to me just

1894
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,920
answer it to yourself

1895
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,239
um

1896
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,840
so this one

1897
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,640
alright

1898
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,440
all right

1899
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,040
so this one now gets up on this one this

1900
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,400
one

1901
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,360
it's

1902
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,239
it's not um

1903
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,000
this is the part where you need other

1904
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,640
tools to make things happen

1905
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,600
uh so i'm gonna load it this is exercise

1906
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,600
three

1907
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,760
well

1908
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,600
as you can see here and we're just going

1909
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,120
to go through really quickly

1910
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,480
as you can see

1911
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,719
here uh it looks like there's a lot of

1912
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:30,679
strings that are

1913
01:16:30,679 --> 01:16:32,320
concatenating

1914
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,480
and at the end

1915
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,800
you know you can form the uh uh the

1916
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,320
base64 uh message here right

1917
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,280
um

1918
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,760
so but just by looking at it there's no

1919
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:44,880
way

1920
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,239
um that you can do this uh in here there

1921
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:50,400
might be ways by finding and replace to

1922
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,320
do it faster

1923
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,120
but in this case we're gonna use a tool

1924
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,600
that every pretty much everyone uses in

1925
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,000
security and that's called python right

1926
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,040
so just by copying this i basically you

1927
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,560
know all you have to do is go to the

1928
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,360
terminal i think i have it here oh no so

1929
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,679
you just type uh you know the command

1930
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,920
line python three you're using three or

1931
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,719
four words no no no four sorry

1932
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,880
not for for is not invented yet but it's

1933
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,400
i guess it's coming

1934
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,840
all you have to do is paste the all

1935
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,040
these strings

1936
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,320
all right

1937
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,159
and hit enter

1938
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:26,080
and then all you have to do is basically

1939
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,840
type the variable

1940
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,280
and boom

1941
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,040
you can do it from here right so here is

1942
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,640
your base64

1943
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,960
encoded right

1944
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,400
so

1945
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,400
what do you do do you want to come back

1946
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,960
to the uh the cyber chef or you want to

1947
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,880
do it from here let me

1948
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,480
in case you don't know how to do it in

1949
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,718
here

1950
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,199
i'll show you

1951
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:53,639
give me a second in fact let me

1952
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,360
if i want to encode the code what's in

1953
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,159
here

1954
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:08,159
and in case you don't know if you just

1955
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,159
do echo

1956
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:12,800
paste the whole thing in quotes

1957
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,280
do a pipe and do base

1958
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,920
64 dash d

1959
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,440
that's the equivalent

1960
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,080
of doing any cyber check so in case you

1961
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,239
don't know that's how you do it

1962
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:24,960
so

1963
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,880
same thing all right

1964
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,040
so again uh we're not using python we're

1965
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,960
not using the term now

1966
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,080
uh

1967
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,239
you know i want to use this so instead

1968
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,679
of uh using it in here so here's the

1969
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,920
thing i don't want to erase this because

1970
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,960
this is part of the uh

1971
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,560
malware right but i want to still be

1972
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,000
able to look at it

1973
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,679
the good thing about cyberchef is you

1974
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,440
can create tabs as well so if you create

1975
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,360
a new tab you can just put in here and

1976
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,560
paste it

1977
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,000
and as you can see here because i

1978
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,840
already loaded the recipe

1979
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,960
you know it provided uh you know more

1980
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,880
information and you can do the same

1981
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,400
thing as i did before um

1982
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,920
beautify generic cold beautify

1983
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,080
or something just to make it bigger

1984
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,320
sorry

1985
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,080
oh good question so

1986
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:23,320
if you go back to to the main uh

1987
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,400
program we'll be able to see that what

1988
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,440
type of compression or stuff

1989
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:36,440
gotcha okay yeah so that's

1990
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,799
let me go back to this one

1991
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,800
oh interesting okay

1992
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,360
i just did uh actually i don't raw

1993
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,199
inflate zero

1994
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,360
yeah

1995
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,360
now do you create it on the uh the

1996
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,520
separate tab

1997
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,000
because remember instead of me putting

1998
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,199
it in here

1999
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,520
i added another tab by clicking the plus

2000
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,719
sign here

2001
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,080
so this open a new tab

2002
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,960
okay and then all i did was from base64

2003
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,600
right and then i do raw inflate and

2004
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,120
that's what

2005
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,199
yeah

2006
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:37,440
right

2007
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,560
decompress it so again just so to answer

2008
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,960
that question the the reason how you

2009
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,040
find this type of service is because

2010
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,560
it's going to be somewhere in the code

2011
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,080
so that's why you have to read the whole

2012
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,159
code to see what's happening so in this

2013
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:57,360
case it's

2014
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,440
it's actually telling you right here i o

2015
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,120
i o compression d

2016
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:04,239
deflate stream and again uh just like

2017
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:07,840
sam did i i tried different stuff until

2018
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,440
and i was getting confused on this

2019
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,440
particular one where

2020
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,480
i tried to deflate it you know and and

2021
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,960
in this case it was raw inflate so

2022
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:17,760
yeah

2023
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,920
so

2024
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,280
yeah

2025
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,239
yeah exactly

2026
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,480
right and yeah and beautify makes it

2027
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,480
beautiful

2028
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:34,799
[Laughter]

2029
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,080
yeah anyways

2030
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,040
yeah

2031
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,679
so again uh

2032
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,719
what is the agent for the http request

2033
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,639
well again uh you wanna just know the

2034
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,140
answer for that is uh url extract

2035
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:56,800
[Music]

2036
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,639
extract urls

2037
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:01,199
and it gives you the actual url right

2038
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,360
there

2039
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,760
there is the ip address but it's as a

2040
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,239
url see

2041
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:13,199
so i did extract url and gave me the ip

2042
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:14,880
now i can do

2043
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,199
extract

2044
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:20,559
i extract ip

2045
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,320
and it will just give me the ipv if i p

2046
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,920
that's the only thing i'm looking at it

2047
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,880
right

2048
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,360
yeah so that's that's the other thing

2049
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,159
and and also notice that um when i

2050
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:39,440
created a new tab in here it also um

2051
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,600
it creates a second tab on the bottom

2052
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,400
right so that's it that's a good thing

2053
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,280
right

2054
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,600
so right moving on i think i have a few

2055
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,480
more

2056
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,120
a few more goals to go through uh the

2057
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,840
next one is actually very cool because

2058
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,239
unless

2059
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,639
unless you keep trying and

2060
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:00,000
shooting yourself

2061
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,760
then that's how you learn so but i'll

2062
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,120
give you the easy answer so

2063
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:07,840
yeah

2064
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,000
all right so let's see here um

2065
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,760
looks like that's it

2066
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,800
it is big yeah

2067
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,520
all right so same thing i'm gonna load

2068
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,520
my my uh

2069
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,840
my exercise um

2070
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:41,520
all right now i'm not gonna do any

2071
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,679
spoiler here

2072
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:47,320
because um

2073
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,320
all right

2074
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,520
so first things first um

2075
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,239
you want uh the uh

2076
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,440
to get the uh the base64 right uh and

2077
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,320
you don't want anything else so again do

2078
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,159
the regular expression first

2079
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,000
and just extract the uh

2080
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,920
the base64

2081
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,760
and it doesn't like it why

2082
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,000
interesting oh okay

2083
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,920
oh yeah that's right okay so in this

2084
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,760
particular one

2085
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,760
if you do it doesn't really matter it's

2086
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,440
not going to work

2087
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,840
you can increase it or decrease it i

2088
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,400
think you do 100

2089
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,040
might do it

2090
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,440
i think 200 might do it

2091
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,199
i think we kept trying

2092
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,880
and eventually like

2093
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,480
we got it but

2094
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,000
what we say is like you know what let's

2095
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,320
just skip it let's not do regular

2096
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,920
expression here because

2097
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,199
that was just uh if it wasn't worth it

2098
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,080
all right

2099
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,600
so in this case

2100
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,080
so long story short on this one

2101
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,040
after

2102
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,639
you decode um

2103
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,800
this

2104
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,840
it becomes this

2105
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,239
right exactly

2106
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:21,280
right

2107
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,120
so

2108
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,199
basically the long story offshore of

2109
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,679
this is

2110
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,880
it has been decoded 28 times in base 64.

2111
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,639
so

2112
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:36,080
normally

2113
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,840
and then you do the raw inflate you know

2114
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,360
it's just going to come back to this and

2115
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,280
this is like what is this

2116
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,320
okay this is look like base64

2117
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,360
what do i have to do

2118
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,600
if you didn't know that there are some

2119
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,159
loops in cybercharge

2120
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:55,440
what is the the the way of doing this

2121
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,520
either copying

2122
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,480
the

2123
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,560
that into another file

2124
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,120
and and or tab and doing it that way you

2125
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,400
use the same

2126
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,360
thing

2127
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,440
but then you're gonna end up with 28

2128
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,839
tabs

2129
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,159
or

2130
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,320
or basically you can drag and drop

2131
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,600
recipes

2132
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,400
or

2133
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,239
sorry ingredients

2134
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:22,800
to cook it right

2135
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,440
there is a nice way of doing

2136
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,239
uh

2137
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:28,800
a good way here and and this is by doing

2138
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,120
loops uh it's actually called jumps but

2139
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,800
it's basically a loop

2140
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,360
a loop that you label it like where you

2141
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,040
want to start and where you want to

2142
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,520
continue doing that right

2143
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,639
so

2144
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:43,760
here i'm going to show you how

2145
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,000
the reason i i thought it was 2-8 times

2146
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,679
or how you know it was 28 times because

2147
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:52,800
trial and error so i increased one one

2148
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,199
one so you got to the point like

2149
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:57,440
okay so

2150
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,080
i didn't know that until after the fact

2151
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,679
right so i did

2152
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:03,440
open 28 tabs

2153
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,400
to find out that

2154
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,480
it was a 28 times

2155
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,159
but then eventually find out that you

2156
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:13,360
can use the jump function or

2157
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,639
operation

2158
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,440
and then it's going to do it

2159
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,239
so as you can see here is 28 but

2160
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:23,040
this is how one looks

2161
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,760
this is how two looks this how oh going

2162
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,560
up or down oh

2163
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:35,280
one two three four five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

2164
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,480
13 14 15 16 17

2165
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:47,360
17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 5 26 27

2166
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,080
you start seeing more readable calls

2167
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,440
right in here

2168
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,960
previous previous to that you didn't see

2169
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,719
it

2170
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,880
28.

2171
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:57,920
right

2172
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,400
and then obviously if you do the generic

2173
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,000
code beautify

2174
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,840
it makes it beautiful

2175
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,880
right

2176
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:09,679
so again this is where the power of um

2177
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:12,400
the jump function or in jump operation

2178
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,600
uh it's it's doable because

2179
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,520
um

2180
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,199
i mean if you don't do malware analysis

2181
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:20,400
then you're fine

2182
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,600
but

2183
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,000
there are ctfs i mean you you have to do

2184
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,760
it for for for

2185
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,159
as a work but if you do it as a just for

2186
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:30,560
fun just playing ctfs you will encounter

2187
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,800
something like this so you want to know

2188
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,960
that there is operations out there that

2189
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,880
you can use in order to solve these type

2190
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,400
of challenges right

2191
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,440
so again uh what is the uh

2192
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,239
the ph php um

2193
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,120
uh

2194
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,960
script here well actually it's like

2195
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,600
right here so um you can do a

2196
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,400
uh fine for php or just it's actually

2197
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:56,080
like right here it's very noticeable

2198
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,880
that's another one

2199
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:00,800
so

2200
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,880
number five

2201
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,560
exercise number five

2202
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,320
it might look easy

2203
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,840
but it's it's

2204
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,600
not literally all you have to do here is

2205
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,960
replace

2206
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,639
the uh uh the carrot and then after that

2207
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:18,000
it will

2208
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,440
basically

2209
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,920
you have to decode it for base64

2210
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:26,400
and and that's it so again um

2211
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,759
just gonna go through it really quick

2212
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,880
uh first things first uh

2213
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,800
it has the other carrot so you do a fine

2214
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,080
and replace so you remove the carrot and

2215
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,320
then you basically do a regular

2216
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,480
expression so you only going to do the

2217
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,199
uh

2218
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,440
the base64 right so here you go it

2219
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:49,280
becomes available now you do from base64

2220
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:50,080
to

2221
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,280
um

2222
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,719
you know uh decoded and then you can do

2223
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:57,440
um the decoded text or you can do the

2224
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,360
other one right in this case i did

2225
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,800
decoded text

2226
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,120
and here is your stuff now this one for

2227
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,840
example does have an

2228
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:08,159
ip well actually just an url with as an

2229
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:11,360
ip no i like it has

2230
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,239
uh

2231
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:15,599
x url extract

2232
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,360
extract urls i keep saying that i don't

2233
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,280
know why

2234
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,880
okay here you go there's two um

2235
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,840
urls uh

2236
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,679
you know and actually

2237
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,920
you can also

2238
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,159
as you're playing with the rail regular

2239
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:35,600
expressions

2240
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,440
there is

2241
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,360
there's options in regular expressions

2242
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,199
that are like if you just want to find

2243
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:42,480
that

2244
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,920
like here it comes with uh user defined

2245
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,639
but you use one ip addresses

2246
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,320
you know it will highlight it like what

2247
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,000
are those ipads are and this is the

2248
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,120
actual regular expressions if you're

2249
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,960
you don't know any regular expressions

2250
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,560
it's actually a good way to learn

2251
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,000
because it gives you already some pre

2252
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,600
predetermined you know uh

2253
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:04,880
fields

2254
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,239
email addresses if you're looking for

2255
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,719
email not no emails in this case

2256
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,560
but there's urls

2257
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,480
that's the url right

2258
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,960
how about domain i just want the domain

2259
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,120
well here you go now look at this

2260
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,159
example

2261
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:19,760
it it does

2262
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,159
it's it's not good because in this case

2263
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,239
it provides an executable right

2264
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,280
exe

2265
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,760
well that's not a a domain

2266
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,159
uh so that's why uh to be honest and

2267
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:32,480
this is from from experience it's better

2268
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,120
if you just do url or when you do just

2269
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:38,080
extract url

2270
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,600
it's just gonna give you the urls and

2271
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,280
then at that point

2272
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,800
you just copy and paste you know the

2273
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,070
domain that's it

2274
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:48,400
[Laughter]

2275
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,360
all right

2276
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,520
so

2277
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:54,000
let's see

2278
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,120
i think i have one more

2279
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:03,440
question six we're getting there guys

2280
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,480
um

2281
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,560
what is like the first thing that comes

2282
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,199
into your mind when you see

2283
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:14,320
it starts with zero

2284
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:18,400
okay

2285
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:22,719
so

2286
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,360
but does it zero means it's nothing

2287
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,599
right

2288
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:32,719
okay

2289
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:34,960
and where do you normally see that like

2290
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,280
if you're opening a something where you

2291
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,840
normally see that

2292
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:44,880
okay

2293
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,400
so

2294
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,120
again trial and error um

2295
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,600
this is a reverse file so if you like

2296
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,880
flip it

2297
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,840
that's the that's the bottom

2298
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,080
so

2299
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,639
so um

2300
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:01,920
let me

2301
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,679
load this really quick and as you can

2302
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:06,880
see this one was not difficult

2303
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,120
but so right now all the zeros are on

2304
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,120
top and all the numbers are on the

2305
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,000
bottom

2306
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,719
if you're into forensics and you know

2307
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:16,560
by heart

2308
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,159
the the the

2309
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:21,280
you know how uh files um initiate with

2310
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,080
you know you know that's uh

2311
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,560
you could pretty much say oh this is a

2312
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,480
uh that xc file or

2313
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:31,280
or or html or something along the line

2314
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:34,000
right in this case uh well everything

2315
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,360
started at the bottom but i don't know

2316
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,560
what it is

2317
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,400
so what i'm gonna do is gonna reverse it

2318
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,800
by character

2319
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,159
so as you can see on the top

2320
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,880
now i started with with something right

2321
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,040
and there is uh i have a document i

2322
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,000
don't know where that is right now

2323
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,679
which has all the uh

2324
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:56,960
the uh

2325
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,120
the headers for for forensics so when

2326
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,120
you're looking into stuff basically

2327
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,800
you're like it's almost like a cheat

2328
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,600
sheet it's like oh that's a um

2329
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,400
that's a png that's a jpeg that's uh

2330
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,480
that move whatever

2331
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,719
okay so now

2332
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,280
okay now we can see okay there is a

2333
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,719
something here

2334
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:19,600
and looks like it's hex uh

2335
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,320
just because it has f's

2336
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,159
and it doesn't have anything other than

2337
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:26,719
f's uh anything about

2338
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:27,840
apps

2339
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,040
so like i can definitely do from hex

2340
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:35,120
and here uh now it starts becoming

2341
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,760
more of uh oh okay it looks like an

2342
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,440
executable why

2343
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,679
anyone wants to give it a try why it's

2344
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:43,600
an executable

2345
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,480
exactly so in this case the mc

2346
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,360
is

2347
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,880
and i don't know the guy's last name i

2348
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,119
just i know it's mark and the last name

2349
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:52,880
is z and it was a

2350
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,360
microsoft programmer in the 70s who

2351
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:58,320
created the pe files and

2352
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:02,159
he gave the name so when you see m c m z

2353
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:05,280
that means it's uh in like my uh uh

2354
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,520
windows executable and especially when

2355
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,679
you see this program cannot be run in

2356
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:10,800
dos mode

2357
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,800
well that tells you it's a windows

2358
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,960
executable right that that's right there

2359
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,239
and then actually like right here it

2360
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,639
says pe and all that so again

2361
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:20,080
you don't know that until you start

2362
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,840
playing with you know packet capture and

2363
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,440
start downloading files and stuff like

2364
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,800
that that's when you really learn this

2365
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,119
right um

2366
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,960
so okay

2367
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,000
do i really

2368
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,159
no here is my production machine and i'm

2369
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,679
just looking at this so i want to run

2370
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:34,800
this

2371
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,320
probably not

2372
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,719
how is another way to check if a file

2373
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:41,520
it's malicious by hash right

2374
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,199
so in this case

2375
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:45,840
uh you know normally if i want to get a

2376
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,560
hash or something i can just do let's

2377
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,920
see i don't know what what i have

2378
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,719
available let's see

2379
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,440
let's see um let's see i just do like

2380
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,719
zoom

2381
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:00,320
and then uh

2382
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,920
i don't know

2383
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,280
utorrent

2384
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,960
that webmd

2385
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,840
and here is the other hash for the hash

2386
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,320
uh

2387
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,920
the shot one for

2388
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,639
for you to run that weapon whatever

2389
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:15,520
right

2390
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,440
uh so that's one way of doing it if you

2391
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,679
know the command line but if you don't

2392
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:20,560
well

2393
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,639
well you have cyber chef to do that

2394
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:24,719
right so that point

2395
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:26,719
if you you know if you play with shot

2396
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:29,600
two which goes you know over 200 or

2397
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,280
something it gives you the different

2398
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,560
types of one so normally uh i'll just do

2399
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,960
256 just because

2400
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,960
at this point the easiest way to do this

2401
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,360
is copy

2402
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,360
go to uh virustotal

2403
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,360
if you are not familiar what virustotal

2404
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,159
is

2405
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,400
it's a way to

2406
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,360
to check

2407
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:52,480
if a website or or hash or ip address or

2408
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,560
something is malicious if it has been

2409
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,639
reported by other security companies if

2410
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:58,159
not

2411
01:36:58,159 --> 01:36:59,040
so

2412
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,600
urls obviously street for urls

2413
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,040
search is for ip addresses urls domains

2414
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,960
file hashes everything else in this case

2415
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,840
i'm going to paste the hash

2416
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,119
and here you go

2417
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:14,480
this is how malicious it is right

2418
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,920
it depending on the company who saw it

2419
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,400
a lot of them are saying it's a backdoor

2420
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:24,239
obviously malaysia's like 70 or 64

2421
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:26,159
companies are saying that it's malicious

2422
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:28,080
it's a trojan

2423
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,920
then from here you can just go and go to

2424
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,719
the details see what it has you know

2425
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:34,320
basically that's just basic malware

2426
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,119
analysis you know looking at the uh

2427
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:40,159
open source intelligence on on on files

2428
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:40,880
on

2429
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,719
websites and stuff like that just to to

2430
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:45,760
aid in your you know help um and here

2431
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,280
obviously gives you more information of

2432
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,600
what it does blah blah you know stuff

2433
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,560
like that

2434
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,760
um and also if you are a subscriber

2435
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,960
uh

2436
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,560
if there's something in the community

2437
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,159
they you know they will provide more

2438
01:37:58,159 --> 01:37:59,920
information of what it is and stuff like

2439
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,480
that but you know

2440
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,000
if you just want to know it's my it's

2441
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,239
good or bad this is just a good way to

2442
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,080
tell um

2443
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,159
depending on what it is

2444
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:12,480
you probably will see some files that

2445
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,159
are like 10

2446
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,880
and below like and you're questioning

2447
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,040
like why the rest of the companies are

2448
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,800
not you know

2449
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,280
marketed as malicious it could be many

2450
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,000
reasons right um like in for example i

2451
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,239
work for a security company when i see

2452
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,719
something is not marked as malicious by

2453
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,320
my my company

2454
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,520
what i do is i i send that

2455
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,719
you know file

2456
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:38,159
to the

2457
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:40,880
anti-virus lab and if they think that

2458
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,080
it's malicious they will create a

2459
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,159
signature and that's going to be updated

2460
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:45,040
here

2461
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:47,760
otherwise don't so uh when i used to

2462
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,320
work in the same security center for the

2463
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,159
same company

2464
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,560
when i was getting like free asian stuff

2465
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:55,520
like that

2466
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,280
sometimes i was the first one to

2467
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,679
discover it like no one else did and and

2468
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:02,639
the way to to know if it's the latest is

2469
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:05,040
by reanalyzing the file right so i'm

2470
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,239
actually going to do that right now so

2471
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:07,840
you can see it but you can do the same

2472
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,719
with uh urls it will say that it was

2473
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:13,280
last week or it was just couple of hours

2474
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,920
don't trust that trust the the latest

2475
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,239
one because that's gonna tell you

2476
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:20,400
in fact it is you know the basically the

2477
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,760
latest update

2478
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,080
um

2479
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,480
so uh again uh

2480
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,199
when i search for the files or urls

2481
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,920
i i refresh it still comes out clean but

2482
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,000
i know i'm like i just went there it's

2483
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,920
malicious you know uh

2484
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,159
how do i report it well i went to my

2485
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:40,400
company and tell them hey it's a

2486
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,040
malicious serial market as url as a bad

2487
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,080
url

2488
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:47,440
and and within 30 45 minutes you know

2489
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,760
they updated and we were like the first

2490
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,239
ones to to get it so that's the purpose

2491
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:54,080
of working for a secure company that

2492
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,679
when you find something

2493
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:57,280
you know they can publish it like right

2494
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,600
away well depends depends but i don't

2495
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,199
want to go into that it's just let's

2496
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:03,280
just put it let's leave it at depends

2497
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:06,080
what it is there's ndas there's a bunch

2498
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,559
of stuff

2499
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:14,440
oh

2500
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,920
so i'll give you an example and this

2501
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:41,440
actually has a good question and since

2502
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,960
this is just a learning experience

2503
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:46,360
when i submit

2504
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:50,440
urls um

2505
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,360
let's see um

2506
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,679
[Music]

2507
01:40:58,880 --> 01:40:59,679
here

2508
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,560
you put the url and this is not just my

2509
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,520
the company but other companies

2510
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:06,400
you can

2511
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,320
suggest what it is

2512
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:12,000
if someone mentions that it's a hacking

2513
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,239
illegal or unethical

2514
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:15,360
hacking

2515
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,119
it doesn't have to be malicious right

2516
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:19,440
there's there's malicious

2517
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,040
there's a spam

2518
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,719
there is a

2519
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:26,400
remote access there is um

2520
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,520
fishing

2521
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,810
and malicious websites

2522
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:32,239
[Music]

2523
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:35,040
if you have a web content web containing

2524
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:38,239
uh firewall that it's basically

2525
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:39,760
checking that

2526
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,000
might not necessarily like in order to

2527
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,400
make it to virustotal as a malicious has

2528
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,400
to be their phishing or malicious

2529
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,760
website

2530
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,480
even if a spam it will say virustotal

2531
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,800
it's a spam right

2532
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:53,600
but

2533
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,199
this particular one

2534
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:57,520
in this case it's hacking right so

2535
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,840
someone can report us hacking if your

2536
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,320
company has a web content filter

2537
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,239
and and it's blocking all types of

2538
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:06,880
hacking content it will block it

2539
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,800
doesn't necessarily is bad it's just

2540
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:09,920
that

2541
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:15,080
it's just the content it's hacking right

2542
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:27,799
so you can actually

2543
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:39,920
right

2544
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:43,040
so not

2545
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:50,159
it's just a learning experience right so

2546
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:52,400
and we're not using a word there we're

2547
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:57,000
using their ip address here

2548
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,320
yeah

2549
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,000
we should go back and do the the

2550
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
wireless hacking so we can do the

2551
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,159
antennas you know practice the antennas

2552
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:09,840
not use the ones from here but the ones

2553
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,520
the front one anyways i didn't say that

2554
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,800
sorry

2555
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,119
all right so that was question number

2556
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:17,119
six so again uh

2557
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:19,600
the whole point on this one is you know

2558
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,280
there is stuff that is reversed so

2559
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,639
sometimes it's not encoded or obfuscated

2560
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:25,679
it's just

2561
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:26,719
that

2562
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:28,800
it's reversed and all you have to do is

2563
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,400
reverse it to make it more readable

2564
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,880
that's it all right

2565
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,119
i did do number five yes

2566
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:37,520
you need to go ahead and do it again

2567
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,280
or wait no that was number

2568
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,679
that was number five no no no no no

2569
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:46,320
i wonder how you can do it

2570
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,920
get that one

2571
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:49,520
there's all the carrots

2572
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,920
oh the ones in the carrots yeah let me

2573
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:57,159
delay right now it was just basically um

2574
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,639
so first

2575
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:10,800
yeah first i finally replaced for all

2576
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,080
the carrots

2577
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:13,520
so it becomes

2578
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,119
this

2579
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:16,639
just to get rid of them

2580
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:20,239
then i just did a regular expression to

2581
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:23,280
to get rid of the powershell.exe

2582
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,840
right so i get rid of that and then i

2583
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,920
did base64

2584
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,239
and then from there i did uh in this

2585
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:31,679
case i

2586
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:34,719
decode text which is the syntax right

2587
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,960
and then that's when i show that this

2588
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,199
particular one has two

2589
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:42,000
two urls right

2590
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,239
yeah

2591
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,360
let's see here uh

2592
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:52,000
this one was long

2593
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,280
okay

2594
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:56,159
um other uses i think i'm done with that

2595
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:58,560
i think uh the last one i had was the uh

2596
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,239
the picture

2597
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:01,920
and and that was part actually of the

2598
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,760
bay cyber uh rsa ctf so let me let me

2599
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:08,880
load that picture because

2600
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,280
i'm i'm going to show you something that

2601
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,080
um when i gave the talk on austin

2602
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:16,960
and i show basically you know how much

2603
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,320
information you're

2604
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,480
you're exposing when you're taking a

2605
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:21,600
picture right

2606
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,920
and i said um

2607
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,639
you know there's ways to you know uh

2608
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:28,560
remove that information

2609
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,639
uh so this is i'm gonna show you one way

2610
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:33,130
but uh but first let me uh

2611
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:35,679
[Music]

2612
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,239
all the way to the top here

2613
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:39,679
um

2614
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:41,840
so this is part of the awesome

2615
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,800
page so if you want to use

2616
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,480
that picture

2617
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,799
um

2618
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,760
the file is right here so this is the

2619
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,119
image one

2620
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:55,679
so if you want to use that one

2621
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:57,520
i'm putting here

2622
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:00,159
otherwise if you're using the uh the

2623
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:02,879
base cyber

2624
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:07,280
it's gonna be on their ctf files

2625
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:11,559
and it's

2626
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:14,880
this picture right here so that's the

2627
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,280
picture we're going to be working on

2628
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:18,080
um

2629
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,840
so let me

2630
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,199
to make things faster let me uh

2631
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:25,199
load it in here

2632
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:29,199
so see that you can also uh upload files

2633
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:30,880
directly into cyber check you don't have

2634
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,880
to like copy and paste you can actually

2635
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,679
you know open it as an input right

2636
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,920
so uh so i'm going to open this picture

2637
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,840
as an input now before i do that

2638
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:45,600
i turn off the uh the auto bake because

2639
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:46,800
basically again it's going to try to

2640
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,480
load something and it's just going to

2641
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,239
it's going to crap out so that's the

2642
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:52,320
reason why i said there are some cases

2643
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,159
especially when you're loading files

2644
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:56,159
that you want to

2645
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:57,119
you know

2646
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,360
turn it off

2647
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:02,239
so i'm going to load it

2648
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:05,119
i'm going to open it

2649
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:06,639
so

2650
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:09,920
to answer the questions

2651
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:13,440
uh from the the ctf which is

2652
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,760
when was the image created

2653
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,239
what is the image size what is the make

2654
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,800
of the camera that took the picture

2655
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,480
where is the model of the camera took

2656
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:26,320
the picture where the picture was taken

2657
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,239
all that

2658
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,719
i'm gonna use cybershare for and

2659
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:34,719
basically answer all those questions

2660
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,679
so first things first

2661
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:39,440
how do i get to

2662
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,440
just to learn about

2663
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,920
this well

2664
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,199
oops

2665
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:47,119
i don't want that

2666
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:49,199
i'm gonna use the uh the

2667
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:51,600
operation called extract exif

2668
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,280
exif i don't remember what it stands for

2669
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,000
but basically long story short

2670
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,719
all types of files whether it's audio

2671
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,719
video pictures

2672
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:02,719
has that metadata and it's just made of

2673
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,800
data that it contains information of

2674
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,239
where the picture was taken uh you know

2675
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:10,320
a lot of stuff so just just by going

2676
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,119
through here you can see that um this

2677
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:17,040
particular um you know picture was taken

2678
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,560
by a samsung

2679
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:22,840
and then the model was the msm-g955u1

2680
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:26,880
uh if it was an

2681
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,119
apple device it just tells you it's an

2682
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:31,440
iphone 7 it's an iphone 8 but in this

2683
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,159
case it's samsung samsung wants to be

2684
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:36,239
you know where a time so at this point

2685
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,400
you have to google what type of device

2686
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,440
was this

2687
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,760
so in case in this case it was a galaxy

2688
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,159
s exploit that's that's the model number

2689
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:45,199
of that

2690
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:46,560
okay

2691
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,600
now

2692
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,600
in this case i just i'm just going to

2693
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,840
start answering these questions as as we

2694
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,880
go through

2695
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:53,840
so

2696
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:57,840
we have the latitude and longitude here

2697
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,760
and those are the things that you need

2698
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:01,679
in order to answer the the further

2699
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:02,880
questions here

2700
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,320
as like where was actually this taken

2701
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,840
so

2702
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,920
normally you will take this

2703
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,119
copy it

2704
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:13,119
and paste it into another place

2705
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:15,440
but you have um you know right x and as

2706
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:19,840
i mentioned before um even in here

2707
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,599
uh where is my stuff

2708
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:24,560
you know you have uh for x if you have

2709
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:25,840
you want to get

2710
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:28,560
especially the gps and stuff like that

2711
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,320
you know there's there's ways to do it

2712
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,239
so in this case i'm going to enable my

2713
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:33,040
my

2714
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:33,920
rare

2715
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,239
genera regular expression for for the

2716
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:38,480
gps latitude and longitude

2717
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:42,080
and as you can see here um

2718
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,960
oh again i have the auto bake off so it

2719
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,520
didn't do it but

2720
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:50,080
here you go so i can just do highlight

2721
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,239
matches which is gonna highlight in here

2722
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:55,119
here or i can do uh you know list

2723
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:57,839
matches right

2724
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,040
question

2725
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,560
oh sorry

2726
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,159
i realized that i have people in the

2727
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:03,599
back sorry go ahead

2728
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:05,360
oh just one more thing when you're

2729
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:07,599
putting the image into the input do you

2730
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:10,239
have to do anything special besides copy

2731
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:11,199
and paste

2732
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:12,719
or

2733
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:15,679
no all you do is basically open

2734
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:18,719
select this one open file as an input

2735
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:21,119
select the the file that you want to do

2736
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:22,239
right

2737
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:25,440
and then open it that's it

2738
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,599
when you do that and let me let me do

2739
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:29,440
that again

2740
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:32,320
when when when you load the other file

2741
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,679
it will give you

2742
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:34,639
like

2743
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:36,320
options like

2744
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,760
download which you don't want to

2745
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,920
download it because you already have it

2746
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,320
or you can do show all right

2747
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,000
so in this case you don't have to do

2748
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,040
anything

2749
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,400
um

2750
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:47,280
you know

2751
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:48,320
you can

2752
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,199
uh

2753
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:50,560
if you want to see the picture you can

2754
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,880
do render image and actually it's going

2755
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:55,920
to show you what the picture is

2756
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,560
that's another way to look at it so

2757
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,560
this is also great for stenography if

2758
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,719
you're into ctf and looking into

2759
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:03,920
stenography

2760
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,599
there is

2761
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:07,440
you know

2762
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:10,880
ways of uh like render image there was

2763
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,800
another one

2764
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,640
let's just do image

2765
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:19,189
[Music]

2766
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:22,960
normalized image i think oh here extract

2767
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,960
the rgba

2768
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,040
and it will tell you like

2769
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:30,000
the different uh colors like how it's

2770
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,440
going to look on red how it's going to

2771
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:34,239
look on green only and on blue only so

2772
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:37,040
again um

2773
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:38,960
that's a whole different topic that's

2774
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:41,040
actually a whole different class just on

2775
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,719
on stenography but i'm just giving you

2776
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,400
just a basic one so

2777
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,960
uh but yeah to answer your question no

2778
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:48,639
you don't need anything else when you

2779
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:50,880
load the picture

2780
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:53,360
nothing is going to come up in here

2781
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:55,280
that's when you're going to start like

2782
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,400
the first thing you want to do is

2783
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,360
extract the exits that's it

2784
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:01,040
so let me

2785
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,560
do that right now any other questions by

2786
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,880
the way uh from from the audience here

2787
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:05,679
or

2788
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:08,800
or um online uh questions that i can

2789
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,040
answer

2790
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:15,520
all right so um so i mentioned that i

2791
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:17,599
want to extract the exif this is the

2792
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:20,480
exif for for this particular picture

2793
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,280
now i want to find out the uh the the

2794
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,719
gps what was this taken uh so this at

2795
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:29,920
this point um i extracted the just just

2796
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,960
that

2797
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,320
and

2798
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,080
because i want to

2799
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,080
make it as as as

2800
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:37,360
quickly as possible to get the

2801
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:40,400
information i want to have it ready to

2802
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,400
basically uh

2803
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,239
so i can do just like a copy up and

2804
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:45,679
paste into

2805
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:46,719
um

2806
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:49,360
into like uh google right for example so

2807
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,679
what i'm doing here is by doing a final

2808
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:53,840
replace i'm removing

2809
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:54,960
the uh

2810
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,920
the extra uh the enter or the paragraph

2811
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,520
and i'm um separating it separating as a

2812
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,400
as a comma the reason why is because

2813
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,639
google has their api for

2814
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:08,719
for you know you want to look where the

2815
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:10,159
pictures start taking and stuff like

2816
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:12,320
that you can do that and and there is a

2817
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:13,840
format so you have to go to like the

2818
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:16,159
google website and look at it that way

2819
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:17,520
um

2820
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,199
so here uh

2821
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:21,280
i'm gonna do another final replace

2822
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:24,639
basically saying copy what's

2823
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:27,360
from the previous line

2824
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,520
and paste it into here and this is the

2825
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:32,480
actual query for that uh

2826
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:34,719
what i will suggest is if you're going

2827
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:37,840
to save this particular

2828
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,679
recipe

2829
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:42,880
check the the the the parameters on for

2830
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,199
the google side because they change it

2831
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:47,440
frequently right so

2832
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,599
my work today but next one might not

2833
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:50,880
work so

2834
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,560
with in here all i have to do is

2835
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,880
basically copy that and it will tell me

2836
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:58,000
where exactly was this picture taken

2837
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,119
and you will

2838
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:00,400
be like

2839
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,719
oh that's not possible you know well

2840
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:04,320
first

2841
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,639
if you look at the picture let me let me

2842
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:08,810
open the picture here give me a second

2843
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:10,800
[Music]

2844
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:14,000
where's all my stuff

2845
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,320
right

2846
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:25,040
well no no no let's let's let's review

2847
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,639
the picture here

2848
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,159
that's san francisco that's a golden

2849
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:29,040
gate

2850
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,719
obviously i was not in a cruise because

2851
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:34,560
otherwise i could not take a picture on

2852
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,199
wasn't it good but no it was not a

2853
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:39,520
helicopter

2854
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:41,440
it was not a drone though it was not a

2855
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:45,199
drone because my drone doesn't take well

2856
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:47,280
that type of pictures plus

2857
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,800
i don't think i'm allowed

2858
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,960
to to fly uh

2859
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,199
on bridges although i do have a story

2860
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:54,719
where

2861
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:56,400
there is in reno there used to be the

2862
01:54:56,400 --> 01:55:00,560
balloon races um i'm talking back 2015

2863
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,840
there was no laws regulations for

2864
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:05,760
drones uh i was

2865
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:09,119
i took my drum on top of the

2866
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:11,679
the balloons and record everything

2867
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:14,320
and all i hear like i'm i'm not in the

2868
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,800
event i'm just like

2869
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:19,760
you know a mile from there and basically

2870
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:21,840
all i hear is like oh we spotted a drone

2871
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,560
please return it back or return or

2872
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,080
whatever

2873
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:29,360
i was going to as i was going to i guess

2874
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:30,960
they sent a jammer

2875
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,480
that make my drone came back where i was

2876
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:37,040
but then after that was unusable i had

2877
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:39,119
they have to i have to it was through

2878
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:43,119
the dji phantom 3 that was my my drone

2879
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:45,280
and and basically have to replace the

2880
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,920
board i could not use it after

2881
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:50,159
that event and you know i learned my

2882
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:52,719
lesson you know to do and then well then

2883
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:54,880
after that they start coming up with uh

2884
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:57,840
licenses and regulations so i got my my

2885
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,960
drone license so

2886
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,760
i don't know how they damn it i i'm

2887
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,199
assuming

2888
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:14,400
it's just like

2889
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,679
a connection

2890
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:16,639
that

2891
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:18,000
to break the connection so i don't

2892
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,840
control it anymore

2893
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,199
but because

2894
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:22,719
it still has

2895
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:25,440
that that particular drone had a

2896
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:28,400
like come back type of thing it came

2897
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,159
back where i was so that was a good

2898
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:31,960
thing i didn't losses wrong it was like

2899
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:34,239
1500 back then

2900
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:35,280
uh

2901
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:38,800
so yeah that's that's uh

2902
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:44,639
there was no no loss when i did it

2903
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:47,360
i could not get sue

2904
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:50,799
for doing what i was doing

2905
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,960
well

2906
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,800
in this case i i actually was violating

2907
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:08,639
i'll tell you why because you know the

2908
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:11,440
balloon you know they're you know if one

2909
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,040
of the the uh

2910
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:15,199
uh looking

2911
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:18,239
forget the name of it but let's say i

2912
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:21,520
fly by one of those balloons and breaks

2913
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,520
yeah the balloon

2914
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:25,920
breaks and then it goes down so i can be

2915
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:28,320
liable for that so what they tried to do

2916
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,080
is prevent me

2917
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:32,320
to cause a disaster which i don't know

2918
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:35,280
what i was about i was younger too

2919
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:36,800
i didn't know what i was doing so that's

2920
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,040
my that's that's that's my argument i

2921
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:40,480
didn't know what i was doing i was i was

2922
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,799
younger

2923
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:43,840
uh

2924
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:45,920
they didn't

2925
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,920
in this those particular cases no

2926
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:51,440
because it was uh it was controlled by

2927
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:53,440
they do have like uh just like in the

2928
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,119
airport they have um

2929
01:57:55,119 --> 01:57:57,280
like so airplanes don't fly by because

2930
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,159
the balloons are all over they they have

2931
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:03,119
a control center right so they

2932
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:05,520
yeah anyways so this one was actually it

2933
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,960
was in a c130 military aircraft uh i i

2934
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:10,400
was um

2935
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,480
here i was actually in

2936
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,400
in the window that when i took it but

2937
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,159
they let me be

2938
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:18,800
when they lower the uh the back of the

2939
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:22,080
cargo i was i was literally hanging with

2940
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:24,159
my my legs taking pictures so that was

2941
01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:27,280
like a good good timing but anyways uh

2942
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,960
so if you look at it kind of just from

2943
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,719
the perspective when when the picture

2944
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:33,520
was taken and go back in here

2945
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,599
i mean this is now google this is just

2946
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:37,440
kind of giving you where

2947
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:41,280
could possibly was it's pretty close

2948
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:42,880
i mean

2949
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,639
i don't know it was just pretty close

2950
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:46,159
maybe

2951
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:48,960
because again the gps on the phone and

2952
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:49,760
you know

2953
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:51,920
everything mislead

2954
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:54,880
but it is pretty close so it's i i want

2955
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:57,119
to say that it's somewhere

2956
01:58:57,119 --> 01:58:58,480
it was somewhere

2957
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,719
around right here when it was taken it's

2958
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:02,639
just that it recorded with these

2959
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:04,719
particular ones right

2960
01:59:04,719 --> 01:59:05,599
so

2961
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:09,040
yeah and that's why you have the picture

2962
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,520
uh actually somewhere around right here

2963
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,440
and that's why you have the picture of

2964
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:16,080
everything else right

2965
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,400
yeah all right so that basically answers

2966
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,000
the first few questions

2967
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,360
the others

2968
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:23,839
let me see

2969
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:28,480
where's my here we go

2970
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,800
the other questions like as far as like

2971
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,159
um

2972
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:37,360
uh like the time so you notice that

2973
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:41,199
um

2974
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:44,598
let's see

2975
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:57,239
because

2976
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:08,639
she submitted a photo of her injury but

2977
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:09,360
they

2978
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:13,119
said they cannot analyze

2979
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:16,350
[Music]

2980
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:29,360
yeah

2981
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:30,960
well let me go back to that because

2982
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:32,480
actually that's a great point so that's

2983
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:34,400
where how do you

2984
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:35,840
you know there's so much information on

2985
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,840
this picture how do i

2986
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,159
don't show that you know information so

2987
02:00:40,159 --> 02:00:43,159
uh

2988
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,840
no the data and the picture it stays

2989
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,000
there as long as it's digital and it was

2990
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,560
created from in this case a

2991
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:07,760
camera right with gps capabilities but

2992
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:09,840
regardless let's say it's just just a

2993
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,760
camera that it was with no gps

2994
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:14,480
capabilities it will provide information

2995
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:15,760
that it's

2996
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:18,960
it's not seeing you know

2997
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:21,199
normally unless you extract

2998
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:23,440
the data also i want to mention that the

2999
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:26,719
information here on exif here it's

3000
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:29,119
limited if you actually download the

3001
02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:31,920
actual tool exif the exif tool

3002
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,360
there is more information you can get

3003
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:35,119
from there and you can automate and you

3004
02:01:35,119 --> 02:01:36,560
can do a bunch of stuff because it's a

3005
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,159
command line tool

3006
02:01:38,159 --> 02:01:40,239
but again just because we're showing

3007
02:01:40,239 --> 02:01:43,199
this so here um

3008
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:45,119
you know one of the questions here is

3009
02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:47,599
when was the picture taken and when was

3010
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:49,199
this created right so here is the

3011
02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:51,199
creation date now

3012
02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:53,040
what is this type of uh format right

3013
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,840
here if anyone knows

3014
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:59,599
that is a time time um

3015
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:02,320
uh it's it's in a time format but it's

3016
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:04,639
not readable

3017
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:06,080
unix okay

3018
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,040
so

3019
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:09,040
to make things easier again regular

3020
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:12,080
expressions i'm gonna extract

3021
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:15,280
the uh the thing here and look uh

3022
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:18,159
you know automatically uh you know the

3023
02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:20,080
magic one tells me that i can do from

3024
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:22,159
unix timestamp and it will give me that

3025
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:24,080
which i already have it here

3026
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:26,560
so here you go i took it on november 5th

3027
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:28,159
2017

3028
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:32,159
at 11 56 with 58 seconds utc now this is

3029
02:02:32,159 --> 02:02:33,199
actually

3030
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:35,679
not true because it was

3031
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:38,320
pacific time zone it wasn't utc so

3032
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:39,840
that's the only misleading thing that i

3033
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:41,199
see here

3034
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:44,199
because

3035
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,320
that is true but then

3036
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:50,560
if you compare it to actual utc it's not

3037
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:53,440
utc is eight hours away from us right so

3038
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:55,599
it will be

3039
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:59,119
you know 7 p.m utc right you know so

3040
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:00,480
1900

3041
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:03,199
you know 56 right uh in this case the

3042
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:04,960
phone says utc and that's that's

3043
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,960
misleading by the way so whoever is

3044
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,280
doing for n6 and they're looking at that

3045
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:10,880
they can clearly say

3046
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:11,920
that

3047
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:13,679
just by looking at the picture

3048
02:03:13,679 --> 02:03:15,599
it wasn't take it at night because

3049
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:16,960
november

3050
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:19,920
7 pm it's dark already i could not take

3051
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,599
that picture that's when you start

3052
02:03:21,599 --> 02:03:24,880
thinking it's like is this really legit

3053
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,400
without looking at the numbers here it's

3054
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:29,520
just like i'm just opening the picture

3055
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:32,239
okay doesn't look like it was actually

3056
02:03:32,239 --> 02:03:37,199
taken at 11 i'm sorry 1156 utc which is

3057
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:38,239
you know

3058
02:03:38,239 --> 02:03:39,760
uh

3059
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:41,440
758

3060
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,679
utc the real

3061
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:46,159
number right so they have to like kind

3062
02:03:46,159 --> 02:03:48,159
of like go back and stuff like that so

3063
02:03:48,159 --> 02:03:50,880
uh as an fyi again this is specific time

3064
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,520
zone not utc but you know

3065
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:54,840
it is what it is

3066
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:58,560
um yeah so that's another one and then

3067
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:01,040
same thing

3068
02:04:01,119 --> 02:04:02,639
you can actually

3069
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:06,000
as i was going through the uh

3070
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,239
the other example for the the

3071
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:10,560
coordinates you can actually get the

3072
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,800
coordinates here

3073
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:17,280
by just doing a gps

3074
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:23,159
something extract gps

3075
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:28,320
or map something

3076
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:31,719
shown map

3077
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,880
and then so on show on map it also gives

3078
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,880
you you know where

3079
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,560
was taken now the only difference

3080
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,199
between this one and the api from from

3081
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:48,400
google

3082
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,280
is

3083
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,760
this is not the greatest in fact if you

3084
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:54,480
compare the the two pictures

3085
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:57,119
right of what was taken

3086
02:04:57,119 --> 02:04:59,360
to this one

3087
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:01,759
yeah

3088
02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:05,559
let me see

3089
02:05:06,159 --> 02:05:07,440
so

3090
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:09,040
so this

3091
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:10,400
with

3092
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:12,480
this

3093
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:16,639
it's pretty close but i've seen others

3094
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:19,040
where they're not that close

3095
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:20,719
so that's why if you want to get the

3096
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:23,920
real stuff get the gps from

3097
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:25,840
the stuff from google

3098
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,360
um

3099
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:28,880
so yeah

3100
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:33,840
uh let's see uh i think that's it

3101
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,000
although oh so going back to your

3102
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,760
question i'm glad that you mentioned it

3103
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:40,000
so how do i remove this information from

3104
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,719
here well there's actually an

3105
02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:45,440
if you just go through the uh the um the

3106
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:47,520
image

3107
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:49,119
or multimedia

3108
02:05:49,119 --> 02:05:50,000
uh

3109
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,280
options here there is plenty right

3110
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,440
the best way to do this

3111
02:05:55,440 --> 02:05:59,119
is by just like if you just type exif

3112
02:05:59,119 --> 02:06:00,840
it gives you two options

3113
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:03,280
extract or remove

3114
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:04,159
okay

3115
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:05,599
so let me

3116
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:08,079
let me remove exit because i don't want

3117
02:06:08,079 --> 02:06:09,599
i want to share this picture with you

3118
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:10,800
but i don't want

3119
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,880
more information i i want to show you

3120
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:15,599
that information so at this point

3121
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:17,360
what i do here is

3122
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,400
i

3123
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:21,440
gonna remove exif see that the output

3124
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,800
it's something

3125
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:25,760
but it doesn't have uh the exit right so

3126
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:27,199
what i'm gonna do here is i'm gonna

3127
02:06:27,199 --> 02:06:28,560
download it

3128
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,290
and i'm to call it um

3129
02:06:30,290 --> 02:06:31,599
[Music]

3130
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:34,079
picture

3131
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:38,719
underscore no access

3132
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:42,000
just jpeg

3133
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,320
i'm going to click okay

3134
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:47,679
look it downloaded to my download

3135
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:51,199
folders so i can re delete that one

3136
02:06:51,199 --> 02:06:54,320
i can um let me clear this as well

3137
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:55,199
let me

3138
02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:59,280
input it let me go to my documents

3139
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:01,920
open the input so now i have the picture

3140
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:06,159
again and i want to extract the exit

3141
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:08,320
zero text

3142
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:10,719
because it remove everything so like let

3143
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:13,280
me let me let me do a compression right

3144
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:16,079
so i'm gonna

3145
02:07:16,079 --> 02:07:20,360
get the input from the other one

3146

[Music]

3147
02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:31,199
hmm

3148
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:34,079
it's like that's a one

3149
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:41,799
is that the one form

3150
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:43,679
i think that's the one called give me a

3151
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:46,000
second

3152

02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:53,400
there it is

3154
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:58,320
see uh on

3155
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,719
this is the arena right

3156
02:08:00,719 --> 02:08:02,880
this is information

3157
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:05,520
but this is the picture we say

3158
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:07,679
and doesn't have any information right

3159
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:10,260
so that's another way of doing it um

3160
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:12,000
[Music]

3161
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,639
uh last but not least i think this is

3162
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:16,239
you know i don't have anything else sort

3163
02:08:16,239 --> 02:08:17,440
of challenges

3164
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:19,679
but notice that there's other ways that

3165
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:23,280
uh things that you can use um you know

3166
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,320
uh

3167
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,320
you know uh

3168
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:27,360
you know when you're doing your

3169
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,520
investigation especially so like for

3170
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:31,040
example um

3171
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:32,719
if you wanna do

3172
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:34,639
uh just wanna know who's the uh the

3173
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:37,840
owner of a particular ip or or

3174
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:38,880
domain

3175
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:40,079
you know you have to

3176
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:41,920
you know as part of your investigation

3177
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:43,440
you know all you have to do is type like

3178
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,199
for example you know

3179
02:08:45,199 --> 02:08:46,320
uh

3180
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:50,400
you know the the the uh

3181
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:51,440
uh

3182
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:52,639
the address

3183
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:54,239
and as you make it it will give you

3184
02:08:54,239 --> 02:08:55,520
information

3185
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:56,560
from

3186
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:57,760
the uh

3187
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:58,560
the

3188
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:01,280
the dns request for that now there is a

3189
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:03,599
specific you want to do the uh the mx

3190
02:09:03,599 --> 02:09:06,400
just for the mx records again you can

3191
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:08,719
gives you the ms records only for that

3192
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:10,239
particular one

3193
02:09:10,239 --> 02:09:11,360
ns

3194
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,840
you know same thing

3195
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:15,520
so

3196
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,440
it can just give you the the

3197
02:09:17,440 --> 02:09:19,119
answer data only so

3198
02:09:19,119 --> 02:09:21,280
you'll find this if you do an ns look up

3199
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:24,400
or rd or you know other commands out

3200
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:25,280
there

3201
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:26,239
but

3202
02:09:26,239 --> 02:09:28,480
let's say that i'm doing the malware the

3203
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:30,639
malware that i show you and i extract

3204
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:33,360
the domain right and right there i want

3205
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:35,280
to know where those belong to like

3206
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:38,159
without leaving cyber chef right so this

3207
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:39,920
is another way to look at it instead of

3208
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:41,679
like going copy and pasting going to the

3209
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:43,760
other screen right that's basically

3210
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:47,040
that's basically how you do it right

3211
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:49,520
and and you know the end of the story of

3212
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:52,079
of this presentation is

3213
02:09:52,079 --> 02:09:54,159
i didn't even cover probably not even a

3214
02:09:54,159 --> 02:09:56,800
quarter of what this tool is capable of

3215
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,800
i just show you like

3216
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:01,679
the tip of the iceberg um this tool is

3217
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:04,239
very very comprehensive in terms of

3218
02:10:04,239 --> 02:10:05,679
things that you can do

3219
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:07,679
uh it's still growing it started

3220
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:09,520
probably five six years ago

3221
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:10,880
and

3222
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:12,639
how it started to where it is now it's

3223
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:15,119
just completely different uh

3224
02:10:15,119 --> 02:10:16,000
people

3225
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,920
you know you can contribute if you

3226
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:19,760
it's written in javascript by the way so

3227
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:22,239
if you're a javascript developer

3228
02:10:22,239 --> 02:10:23,040
um

3229
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:24,960
you know

3230
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:26,480
you know they're always looking for

3231
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:29,280
something for people to do and and fix

3232
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:31,920
stuff so you want to contribute

3233
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,079
here is the um

3234
02:10:34,079 --> 02:10:36,719
here's the uh

3235
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:38,000
the page

3236
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,679
this is where you can contribute this is

3237
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:40,719
where you

3238
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:42,239
can see

3239
02:10:42,239 --> 02:10:44,079
demos you can see

3240
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:45,840
even stuff that they

3241
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:47,679
they um

3242
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:48,960
they have

3243
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:51,599
this one the decrypt and uh disassemble

3244
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:53,040
uh shellcode

3245
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:54,880
uh for the ones who

3246
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:57,440
took the challenge from google uh this

3247
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:00,800
is shelco by the way so um

3248
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:02,480
you know take a look at it

3249
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:04,239
um you know

3250
02:11:04,239 --> 02:11:05,920
just uh

3251
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:07,840
whenever you have a chance

3252
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:08,880
and

3253
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:11,040
what else

3254
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:14,320
that's it any questions

3255
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:20,040
yes

3256
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:28,480
so there's hope that military can

3257
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:30,160
provide tools

3258
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:33,349
[Music]

3259
02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:53,199
or backdoors

3260
02:11:53,199 --> 02:11:57,280
i want to say no malware with backdoors

3261
02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:04,639
i mean this is for everybody it's not

3262
02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:06,719
this is not a uh

3263
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:09,119

creator on that class his name is matt

3277
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:54,320
and he has like a bunch of cyber chefs

3278
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:56,079
uh recipes

3279
02:12:56,079 --> 02:12:58,719

invoke of justice

3284
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:11,040

3285
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:12,480
cobble strike

3286
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:13,599
to

3287
02:13:13,599 --> 02:13:14,840

else you know

3289
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:19,440
creating a wi-fi qr code

3290
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:20,480
to

3291
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:22,719
you name it uh from ham

3292
02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:25,040
from a sandbox email to malicious rl

3293
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:27,520
blah blah

3294
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:28,400
again

3295
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:31,440
he has tons of recipes so definitely

3296
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:34,719
take a look at it he has a class at uh

3297
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:37,599
mbc network defense at io

3298
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:38,400
uh

3299
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,159
you know

3300
02:13:40,159 --> 02:13:41,920
chris sanders is obviously the guy who

3301
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:44,480
create this site but it has multiple

3302
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:46,159
side multiple

3303
02:13:46,159 --> 02:13:48,800
classes and this one the cyber chef for

3304
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:51,280
security professionals that's the

3305
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:53,920
the class i took and

3306
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:56,239
it's worth every penny

3307
02:13:56,239 --> 02:13:58,560
it made my life different when i took it

3308
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:02,639
so shout outs to them and um

3309
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:04,800
so uh how many teams are

3310
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,719
using your chef and what is the primary

3311
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:09,119
limitations in your view well i i did

3312
02:14:09,119 --> 02:14:10,560
mention some of the limitations

3313
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:12,400
obviously loading

3314
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:15,119
bigger files right

3315
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:17,440
sometimes it will

3316
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:19,360
make the the computer slow or it will

3317
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:20,079
not

3318
02:14:20,079 --> 02:14:22,719
all be unresponsive

3319
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:24,480
in terms of teams if you have an

3320
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:27,360
internal

3321
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,920
server that is just dedicated for for

3322
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:31,920
cyber chef it's great because then you

3323
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:33,440
can share

3324
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:34,480
you know you don't have to copy and

3325
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:37,440
paste and send it by email you can just

3326
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:39,760
do what i basically been doing loading

3327
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:42,239
recipes as we go through and and modify

3328
02:14:42,239 --> 02:14:43,920
it on the go

3329
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:47,920
so limitations again it's a web-based uh

3330
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:48,880
you know

3331
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,440
if there is going to be bugs because

3332
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:54,400
it's a open source project uh

3333
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:56,400
you know the whoever is in charge of the

3334
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:57,920
project will

3335
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:01,360
they'll do the changes but you know

3336
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:04,480
you know sometimes it will

3337
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,560
you know we will craft out and

3338
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:08,800
there's no like support you can submit

3339
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:12,079
uh tickets right to have those fixed but

3340
02:15:12,079 --> 02:15:14,400
again um don't

3341
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,800
don't know how how long it's gonna take

3342
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:19,920
um there's many uh limitations obviously

3343
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:23,280
still like nah

3344
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:26,079
there's no like an easy

3345
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:28,630
way to like let's say take a a um

3346
02:15:28,630 --> 02:15:30,239
[Music]

3347
02:15:30,239 --> 02:15:31,840
a malware hash

3348
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:34,960
and automatically do like an auto like

3349
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,599
by aristotle you know recipes there or

3350
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:38,719
or

3351
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:40,560
or operators there's not something like

3352
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:41,360
that

3353
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:43,760
but there is like the thing i did with

3354
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:44,719
um

3355
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:47,360
with the gp uh the gps coordinates right

3356
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:50,400
where you can get the api from how it

3357
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,639
works with writer's total

3358
02:15:52,639 --> 02:15:53,679
and

3359
02:15:53,679 --> 02:15:55,599
and basically you can do the same thing

3360
02:15:55,599 --> 02:15:57,280
i i did right

3361
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:59,520
pasting it where it's supposed to be

3362
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:02,639
and and that's it but again

3363
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:05,280
the learning curve is

3364
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:08,079
it's not bad

3365
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:10,079
but it's also

3366
02:16:10,079 --> 02:16:11,760
everything looks very like oh yeah it's

3367
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:13,599
easy to do but as you can see there's

3368
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:16,400
many ways that you can do things

3369
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:19,520
and you know just from there

3370
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:23,119
you you can sometimes you know

3371
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:33,120
it's just i'm not getting the answer

3372
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:34,398
like that like for example with the

3373
02:16:34,398 --> 02:16:36,879
malware that had a loop of 28 times that

3374
02:16:36,879 --> 02:16:38,799
that one is specific like i literally

3375
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:41,040
have to do 28 tabs in order to like like

3376
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:43,040
see it right i didn't know until i did

3377
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:44,638
that and eventually i knew there was a

3378
02:16:44,638 --> 02:16:46,718
better way of doing it but it was just

3379
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:48,558
trial and error and and you'd be

3380
02:16:48,558 --> 02:16:50,730
persistent and all that um

3381
02:16:50,730 --> 02:16:52,318
[Music]

3382
02:16:52,318 --> 02:16:54,879
uh tools like like this honestly you're

3383
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:57,280
the terminal if you're especially in

3384
02:16:57,280 --> 02:16:58,718
linux if you

3385
02:16:58,718 --> 02:17:01,359
um if you are a

3386
02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:04,399
kung fu uh

3387
02:17:04,638 --> 02:17:07,359
terminal you know ninja

3388
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:09,519
you can do literally everything in there

3389
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:12,478
and python uh you know sam you know here

3390
02:17:12,478 --> 02:17:14,558
has a uh

3391
02:17:14,558 --> 02:17:16,879
you know python class that or workshop

3392
02:17:16,879 --> 02:17:19,040
that it's basically shows a lot of the

3393
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:20,879
stuff that i show here

3394
02:17:20,879 --> 02:17:23,040
can be done in python and you know if

3395
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:25,519
you know python be my guess right for

3396
02:17:25,519 --> 02:17:27,920
for the people who also know python then

3397
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:30,000
well it's again another learning curve

3398
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,718
so which one is easier drag and drop or

3399
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:34,799
type well here you go right so that

3400
02:17:34,799 --> 02:17:37,120
that's your answer right there uh

3401
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:39,280
you choose the right tool for for the

3402
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:40,240
job

3403
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:42,638
and again you have many tools that does

3404
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:44,318
it commercial

3405
02:17:44,318 --> 02:17:47,200
open source but um

3406
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:49,519
yeah so that that's the answer right

3407
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:51,280
there

3408
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:52,318
so yeah

3409
02:17:52,318 --> 02:17:55,200
do you know if this tool has like an api

3410
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,920
to integrate other tools

3411
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:00,638
there is an api thing in fact uh let's

3412
02:18:00,638 --> 02:18:01,679
see

3413
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:03,709
i think i had it on um

3414
02:18:03,709 --> 02:18:04,959
[Music]

3415
02:18:04,959 --> 02:18:09,959
i find it in here i hate this one home

3416
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,920
let me look at my book in fact i booked

3417
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:14,558
market for that reason

3418
02:18:14,558 --> 02:18:16,398
for that specific reason because there

3419
02:18:16,398 --> 02:18:17,920
is there is a

3420
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:19,120
one server

3421
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:21,519
yeah yeah it's actually right here uh

3422
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:25,240
let's see here we go

3423
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:28,478
uh restful api server so this is a cyber

3424
02:18:28,478 --> 02:18:30,959
chef server where you can do apis and

3425
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:34,000
then here are the example for for those

3426
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,280
so uh yeah i have not played with it in

3427
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:39,439
fact i am not the

3428
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:41,040
api guy

3429
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:43,120
well you know

3430
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:44,718
i i

3431
02:18:44,718 --> 02:18:46,799
either stick with the terminal or cyber

3432
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:48,080
chef at this point

3433
02:18:48,080 --> 02:18:50,160
that's it

3434
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:51,519
um

3435
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:53,120
what else uh

3436
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:56,478
oh and i did mention um

3437
02:18:56,478 --> 02:18:58,638
that there is answers for the recipe so

3438
02:18:58,638 --> 02:19:00,398
here is the the link for the recipes if

3439
02:19:00,398 --> 02:19:02,879
you want to take a picture of it uh the

3440
02:19:02,879 --> 02:19:05,760
recipes that i you know i use for

3441
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:08,318
everything i did are in there so

3442
02:19:08,318 --> 02:19:11,599
i'll be my guest and

3443

and

3447
02:19:20,799 --> 02:19:23,200
obviously my reference you know the guy

3448
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:26,080
matt is awesome with his chef recipes he

3449
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:28,718
also has a lot of ioc's that you can use

3450
02:19:28,718 --> 02:19:31,280
for practice you know not just for his

3451
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:34,398
uh recipes but you know in general and

3452
02:19:34,398 --> 02:19:36,240
the class i mentioned

3453
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:38,240
and again if you don't have any

3454
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:39,760
questions

3455
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:40,558

ctfs

3471
02:20:14,479 --> 02:20:17,120
uh we're planning to

3472
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:18,960
the winner of the uh the main city app

3473
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:21,439
is gonna have a ticket for defcon but it

3474
02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:23,200
has to be a solo player

3475
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:24,000
uh

3476
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,319
but more more to come in in that respect

3477
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:27,200
because

3478
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:28,319
we uh

3479
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:30,000
i thought we had a sponsor but they have

3480
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
not respond back to me so i'm not gonna

3481
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,560
take them out of the list until they say

3482
02:20:34,560 --> 02:20:35,359
no

3483
02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:37,439
but if you would like to sponsor it or

3484
