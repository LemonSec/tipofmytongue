to get out of something right

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
as i always mentioned you know we have

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,120
uh

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
good use cases

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,599
uh or good experiences on on people who

65
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,640
has come

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,599
and attended the meetings they have got

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,480
jobs in in the industry because you know

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,239
sometimes the managers are here and they

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,400
present and stuff like that

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,480
i was one of them few years ago and

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,160
that's the reason why you know i believe

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,640
in this and i think everybody you know

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,360
should you know uh if

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
you want to help that's another way just

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
spread the word uh tell your bosses who

76
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,319
we are what we do and let them come

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,760
because maybe that's how you're gonna

78
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,720
get your next co-worker or you know

79

uh you have to have the explo expo pass

129
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,000
plus not just the regular expo pass the

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,160
expo patch is going to give you access

131
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160

133
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
hallway the hall

134
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,919

for some of our members this is a

156
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,360
new uh

157
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,080

158
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,720
you probably know rsa it's very uh you

159
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,440
know executive you know oriented not

160

um then uh if you cannot make it to rsa

168
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
because you know you just don't want to

how you can protect yourself

275
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,320
uh on when you're trying to implement

276
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,800
wi-fi right and there's many solutions

277
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,200
some of them are are free some of them

278
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,880
are you have to pay

279
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
but i'm just going to show you so as you

280
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,279
probably know i work for a

281
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,920
security company called fortinet

282
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,200
and i make well they make the company

283
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,440

284
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,640
is you know

285
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,959
wireless access points and we make a

286
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,880
wireless and

287
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,279
i mean firewalls and basically the whole

288
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,399
nine yard

289
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,200
so

290
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,360
today i'm just going to give you uh just

291
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,839
kind of like a pickup from where we left

292
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,000
off last time last time because you know

293
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,760
it took three hours to

294
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
go through the whole thing so um so

295
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
today uh i'm just gonna give you a quick

296
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,959
overview on on the firewall how it looks

297
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,320
and how you can protect yourself okay so

298
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
let me change my view here

299
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,429
[Music]

300
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
all right can you guys see my screen on

301
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,560
on the other side

302
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
i know the uh my my people here finally

303
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,240
we have a total of four people including

304
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,519
myself so that's

305
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,040
that's good um

306
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,720
awesome

307
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
so um so this is when when you fire up a

308
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
a

309
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,279
a uh fourier gate um you will get a

310
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,519
login page just like anything else

311
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
and you know already pre-configure this

312
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,200
one so

313
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,800
uh let me let me show you something

314
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
really quickly so you're probably not

315
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,600
you're not seeing it on on

316
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,160
in online but

317
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,240
if you can look it up in here

318
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
these are the the the four gates i was

319
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
talking about so the one on the left uh

320
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,240
the one on this side

321
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,399
this is yeah for a wi-fi

322
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,680
30e it's uh it's an older model but it

323
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
works great it's it's a firewall and

324
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,040
it's a

325
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,079
wireless

326
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,120
so it's almost like what you buy um in

327
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,560
the in the store

328
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,320
but it's obviously powerful right

329
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
because you can put a bunch of stuff

330
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,360
uh the one on the right it's a wireless

331
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,040
access point

332
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
uh but obviously

333
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,959
it doesn't work by itself you have to

334
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,000
basically uh connect it to a fortigate

335
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,880
to manage it or any other solution and

336
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,360
then um it's a the model is 433f

337
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,040
uh 48p ap 43f

338
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
and uh you know has antennas i didn't

339
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,360
put the antennas because you know uh i

340
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,680
wanted to make it more mobile but um i

341
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,240
will i'm going to show you uh you know

342
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
how it works and how can you protect

343
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,959
yourself using these type of devices so

344
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,160
in a second here let me

345
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,839
log in here

346
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,639
so

347
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,040
so if you've never seen a uh uh

348
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,199
fortigate before you know it's it's a

349
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,560
full a full

350
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,760
you know

351
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,360
uh uh

352
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,600
and you know it's a it's a it's a

353
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,360
a commercial

354
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,399
and uh commercial grade firewall right

355
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,760
this is what

356
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
small businesses are going to use to

357
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,600
protect themselves

358
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,199
and uh

359
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,000
you know

360
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,399
foreign believes in creating fabrics or

361
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,040
creating a fabric which means

362
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,360
we have any

363
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
any products that you can think of we

364
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,440
have we go from uh firewalls to switches

365
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
to void

366
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,639
to secure cameras the ones that you

367
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,959
install on the uh

368
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,079
uh you know in places for surveillance

369
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,279
um

370
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,360
we make uh source uh we make scenes we

371
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,880
make uh

372
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,040
we have an edr solution that's where i

373
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,519
work uh we have an antivirus we have a

374
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,480
vpn

375
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,240
we have basically the whole nine yard

376
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,079
anything that you can think of uh you

377
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,199
know we have

378
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,880
so uh the

379
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,000
the

380
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
the goal of fortinet is obviously have

381
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
all these products and that they can

382
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,839
talk to themselves and you know and

383
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,120
that's how you're gonna secure it from

384
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,759
one device right so to make it easy for

385
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,600
um you know uh for our customers uh so

386
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,079
this is basically you know gives you a

387
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,880
quick overview of you know uh about your

388
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,279
environment you know how many devices

389
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,839
you have uh you know is it

390
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,800
compliant like if it's subscribed to our

391
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,839
so uh

392
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,880
also thread intel uh uh subscription

393
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,240
which is 4g

394
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,959
labs um and stuff like that and you know

395
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,279
from there you have a lot of stuff you

396
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,639
you can do

397
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,880
the bigger the firewall the the the most

398
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,800
options are going to have so again i'm

399
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,519
just going to give you a quick overview

400
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,320
so

401
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,759
right now

402
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,680
the way you can see things is like i

403
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,639
have connected my uh 40

404
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,000
uh ap

405
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,920
which is uh

406
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
this one right here and this is the one

407
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,000
that is going to give you uh or is going

408
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,399
to provide a wireless right

409
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,399
i don't have anything configured yet but

410
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,839
that's where i'm going to show you how

411
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,959
to do it

412
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,240
you know

413
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,120
in an easy and faster way

414
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,759
here you you can see how many

415
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,360
you know what are your threats the

416
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,759
websites that people are going into

417
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,759
uh if you have a compromise host you

418
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,120
know it's gonna show

419
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,079
uh you know the whole nine yards

420
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,839
um then

421
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,839
we have you know this is are your

422
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,319
interfaces this is again this is a small

423
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,720
device you can actually see in here

424
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,199
you know you have only four ports and

425
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,760
your one so it's a total of five

426
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,039
and

427
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,000
uh and you also have a wi-fi which it's

428
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,559
currently disabled but

429
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,480
you know this this particular firewall

430
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,679
or for your wi-fi in this case it's um

431
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,000
it's it provides also wireless without

432
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,079
having the the wireless access point the

433
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,240
wireless access point will be

434
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,600
uh you know for extra you know uh you

435
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,080
know if you want to run cables from them

436
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
your

437
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,160
main uh uh

438
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
closet to you know the other side of

439
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,200
your house then you can do it uh here's

440
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,679
where you do your dns if you want to use

441
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,600
uh for uh 40 guard dns you can do that

442
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,919
otherwise you can change it uh but one

443
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,760
of the cool things is and i'm going to

444
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,320
show you here is the feature visibility

445
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,799
that this uh

446
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,080
device can do right now everything as

447
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,679
you can see or most of it is is uh

448
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,799
unchecked

449
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,360
it's not enabled but just look at how

450
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,000
many stuff that you have

451
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you can change it from a just a next

452
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,240
generation firewall to a full utm right

453
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,559
you can enable advanced routing you can

454
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,240
do explicit proxy you can do a

455
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,080
certificate manager uh dns database uh

456
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
you know the whole nine yard right

457
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,240
uh

458
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,120
you you can do voip um you can do

459
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,919
wireless open security again depending

460
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,039
on on what you want to do you know

461
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,440
you can enable it just keep in mind that

462
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,600
with a device like this it's very very

463
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,039
small

464
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,960
it doesn't have a lot of bandwidth a lot

465
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,799
of memory so

466
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,320
chances are that either it's not going

467
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,039
to run because the uh is not compatible

468
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,240
with the uh device or it's just too much

469
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,919
and you still you're not gonna be able

470
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,280
to do it

471
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,039
um you know

472
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,120
from the policy standpoint

473
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,400
it's just gonna be a regular um just

474
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,360
like any other firewall it has your your

475
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,919
you know uh where the place where you

476
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,480
create the rules you know you know

477
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,480
uh if you wanna talk to the outside you

478
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,600
know there's uh rules that allows you to

479
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,919
and then uh you know there's a basically

480
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,240
these devices are you know are awesome

481
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
um again i'm not trying to pitch my

482
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,559
company but uh you know there right now

483
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,360
there's only a few top contenders in the

484
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,799
next generation firewall in you know uh

485
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,960
industry and it's just basically palo

486
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,799
alto uh uh fortinet uh checkpoint and

487
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,200
you know the rest are you know are

488
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,520
falling behind because these companies

489
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,440
are basically going with everything so

490
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,039
you can do you can have a vpn

491
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,320
concentrator

492
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,559
this is going to be like your road vpn

493
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,320
and you can have other

494
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,440
firewalls uh you know connect to it

495
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,280
uh here under use uh devices so i'm

496
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,360
gonna discuss radio servers so if you

497
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,280
recall last time from last meeting the

498
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
last meeting you know we we said let me

499
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,400
check my my chat really quick

500
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,320
uh so alex do you need to have month uh

501
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,760
among the license to run it no so

502
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,679
you can buy the uh um the firewall

503
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,799
without a subscription it comes with a

504
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,400
90-day subscription

505
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,360
to foreign but honestly uh if you have

506
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,000
other type of subscriptions there is um

507
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,520
hearings

508
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,120
fabric connectors

509
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
you can you can

510
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,520
point it to other uh

511
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,400
uh

512
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,799
thread thread fits for example here

513
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,320
uh not just for regard you can do uh

514
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,480
other companies or even yourself if you

515
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,320
have like let's say a um

516
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,880
a repository of hashes that you're or or

517
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
earlier we were discussing bt

518
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,360
underground bx underground you know if

519
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
you have a repository from them you know

520
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,240
obviously you're going to have the

521
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
hashes so again you can just get a list

522
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,880
and it's that it's going to be keep

523
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,039
updated and you can have it here so you

524
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,440
don't have to have a subscription for it

525
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
although you're not going to get the

526
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,840
latest and greatest from foreign

527
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,880
you know that's the only difference uh

528
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,799
and then the other question is so what

529
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,360
will the target be for this size small

530
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,919
business maybe 12 users this actually

531
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,120
this firewall will be perfect uh because

532
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,320
again it only has four ports which

533
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,440
technically

534
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
it's it's not that those four ports are

535
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,400
going to go to an end user it will

536
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,280
probably go to a 40 switch or any other

537
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,919
switch that you know talks to uh

538
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:56,840
you know

539
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,720
uh switch uh uh language whatever that's

540
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,200
called now just vlans uh you know you

541
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,000
can point to you create vlans on the uh

542
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,039
fourier gate and then uh use those same

543
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,760
vlans you're using like cisco routers

544
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,400
i'm sorry switches or hp switches and

545
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,520
stuff like that

546
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,720
so yeah

547
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,039
these these small devices are great so

548
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,200
anything below 800

549
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,080
are great for small businesses this is

550
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,320
this is like the smallest that we have

551
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,919
and also it's it's

552
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,760
an old device

553
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,799
um

554
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,000
we uh

555
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,799
we just released new uh um

556
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,039
fortigates like in the last week or so

557
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,400
who are basically um

558
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,120
the the purpose is still a small medium

559
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,799
businesses but they have other

560
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,679
capabilities uh it really depends what

561
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,480
you want so but anything below uh

562
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,000
a hundred will be

563
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,480
is basically what you're looking for

564
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,039
at my house i have a

565
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,000
40

566
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,360
80e

567
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,000
and it's obviously uh you know has more

568
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,039
memory

569
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,919
uh you know has more has like a 12 ports

570
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,760
you know it has a lot of stuff that you

571
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,640
can do uh but anyways uh that's how you

572
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,799
do it uh since i'm here i'm gonna

573
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,360
actually point a few things here so

574
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,159
you know all the 40 gates has uh you

575
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,280
know you can create uh users right and

576
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
it can be local but also you can point

577
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,320
to other places like active directory or

578
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
you have a radio server which that's

579
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,880
what i basically stopped

580
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,440
a radio server from last

581
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880
month's talk

582
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,600
it's a server that you can use to

583
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,679
authenticate you know wireless users

584
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,159
right um you can create your own

585
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,240
wireless server here in the fortigate or

586
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,159
you can point it to another location

587
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,679
right

588
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,320
and this is basically where you do it so

589
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,360
let me go back in here

590
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,400
here under user devices you create your

591
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
your users you create your groups

592
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,919
if you have an ldap server um you know

593
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,400
you point it to it if you have radio

594
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,520
servers basically the same thing um you

595
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,919
can create a whole you know

596
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,760
just point it to

597
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,880
another one

598
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,760
uh or you can use the ones that are are

599
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,000
you defined on the users here so it's

600
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,840
really uh

601
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,240
really up to you and then last but not

602
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,200
least

603
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,520
this is where uh this is where i was

604
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,799
heading right

605
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,520
wireless so

606
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,440
again by by ukraine an ssid that is a

607
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,960
pressure key

608
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,520
we we know uh that is basically

609
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,000
vulnerable to you know it's very easy to

610
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,480
crack right and that's just

611
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,520
from last

612
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,200
month's talk

613
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,320
uh so obviously we don't want to have

614
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,080
a wireless

615
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,159
that is open to everyone

616
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,200
right so we want to have something that

617
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
your users are going to be

618
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,080
somehow authenticated so there's to

619
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,559
prevent basically uh you know wireless

620
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,840
attacks

621
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,679
a good way to do it and that's what i'm

622
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,440
going to show you is

623
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,559
having a device like this so first of

624
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,559
all let me introduce you to the uh

625
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,200
40 ap

626
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,880
433 f

627
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,360
this is a device that you know again

628
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,600
it's just a wireless access point but it

629
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,559
has

630
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,799
different functions so

631
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,320
if you go to like the profiles for

632
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,000
example

633
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,880
and i'm going to edit the the profiles

634
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
you can specify

635
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,679
how each of the uh the radios because we

636
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,720
have three radios and i'll show you here

637
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,240
how each of the radios um

638
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,200
which band you want them to run on like

639
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,480
like this one

640
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,279
radio one you wanted to run on the uh

641
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,760
you know just on

642
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,120
[Music]

643
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,840
802.11g

644
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,880
or n

645
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,279
you can just specify that

646
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,600
you can change uh what channels you

647
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,880
wanted to use

648
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,720
you can change the power of how much

649
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,559
power you're producing you know those

650
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,400
antennas are going to be producing which

651
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
means um

652
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,080
i know we discussed it last time by

653
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,480
reducing the power meaning it's not

654
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,320
going to broadcast the uh the signal you

655
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,960
know that's a a preventive

656
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,440
preventive way of doing it that doesn't

657
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,640
mean it's it's just going to be

658
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,520
successful because we can make a

659
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,679
homegrown antenna that you know

660
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,520
basically i can get access from one

661
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,679
building to another and we discussed it

662
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,840
last time again i'm just you know

663
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,320
touching on what i uh what i'm what we

664
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,679
mentioned last time

665
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,039
um

666
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,640
and then radio 2 it's uh uh five

667
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,120
gigabytes uh gigahertz

668
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,840
band and again you can also choose what

669
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
you want to broadcast in here and here

670
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,120
you can also choose the channels uh

671
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,600
choosing channels and also this not only

672
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,000
works on companies but also works in

673
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,240
your house if you have two wireless

674
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,760
access points make sure that they they

675
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,440
you pick different channels for your

676
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,480
devices uh otherwise you know if you use

677
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,320
the same there's gonna be a collision

678
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,559
and eventually instead of getting good

679
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,919
signal you're gonna you're not gonna

680
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,600
have good signals so

681
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,279
uh so again

682
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,240
and then the third one it's basically a

683
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,080
dedicated monitor

684
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,679
uh uh

685
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,799
uh

686
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,799
wireless so

687
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,480
you're probably wondering and why do i

688
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,200
need a monitor wireless well it's

689
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
actually there are some good cases

690
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,240
i'll i'll actually give you uh uh

691
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,080
uh tell you in a scenario one that

692
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,120
happened

693
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,000
so

694
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,480
we uh um

695
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,880
a long time ago we

696
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,760
have to let go an engineer who was doing

697
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
something bad in the company

698
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,080
and um

699
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,679
you know he uh

700
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,640
we obviously had a record of his devices

701
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,039
um

702
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
you know that he basically brought from

703
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,320
home

704
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
and like cell phone you know stuff like

705
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,120
that

706
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,480
so when he got let go um he he was a

707
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
disgruntled employee

708
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,159
and he swear that he was going to come

709
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,120
back

710
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,360
so long story short he didn't show up

711
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,039
for six months

712
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,440
and eventually we got a notification

713
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,480
because obviously we got his mac address

714
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,360
and

715
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,279
not just his cell phone but you know his

716
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,080
car

717
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,880
and other stuff so we knew

718
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,360
from which uh uh part of the building he

719
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,960
was trying to get into

720
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,480
uh because uh the antennas picked it up

721
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,799
and again uh that's just the way to do

722
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,799
it and actually that's a good

723
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,640
good uh opportunity here to show you

724
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,919
wi-fi maps

725
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,320
uh here obviously i don't have a map

726
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,200
here

727
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,600
uh and then um

728
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,919
you can basically put a diagram of your

729
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,799
map

730
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,679
right uh of your your building and point

731
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,240
where those antennas are and then

732
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,840
just kind of like keep track of the

733
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,520
antennas and the location and and then

734
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,919
you know modify where which antennas are

735
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,399
going to give like full power which of

736
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,880
the antenna especially the edge antennas

737
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,159
that are not going to be brought

738
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,200
broadcasting outside you know

739
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,000
you know stuff like that

740
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,039
oh yeah so question so he was let go and

741
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,960
six months later he tried to read yeah

742
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,360
yeah because uh again i don't know what

743
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,399
was going his intentions but he when he

744
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,080
left uh because

745
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,840
he didn't he wasn't let go

746
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,120
um in a nice way i guess

747
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,640
he he starts you know talking trash

748
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,520
and uh long story short uh again he

749
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
tried to come back to do something

750
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,159
at that point we knew who he was uh how

751
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,960
he did it and we actually just called

752
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,039
the police and say you know and then we

753
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,600
again we have other you know monitoring

754
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,480
uh

755
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,399
uh surveillance cameras and stuff like

756
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,799
that that was able to pick up um you

757
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,760
know

758
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,640
see the location so that's why uh i know

759
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
saki eventually is gonna talk about you

760
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,200
know you know i.t and sock and stuff

761
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
like that but that's why you you need

762
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,840
you must have a sock you know especially

763
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,640
well depending on where you're

764
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,200
protecting right

765
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,880
you know if you have

766
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,720
you know if you're

767
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,200
have like a lot of r d and stuff like

768
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,600
that and you want to be protected you

769
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,159
know just make sure that you know

770
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,399
you have that monitoring and detection

771
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,679
and uh

772
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,679
you know and continuously doing threat

773
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,679
hunting and stuff like that so you you

774
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,399
avoid this type of uh attacks right so

775
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,600
just like

776
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,799
that particular scenario um

777
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,559
again we were able to to be proactive

778
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,039
in in the sense that

779
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,080
our

780
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,240
monitor

781
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,300
our

782
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,039
[Music]

783
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,360
access point was able was in monitoring

784
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,640
mode

785
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,279
detected something that probably we will

786
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,519
not be able to do until maybe something

787
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,799
happened so this is just a uh example of

788
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,159
how a

789
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,600
uh 40 ap or any other 40 ap would has

790
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,840
monitoring

791
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,080
uh you know capabilities be able to do

792
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,559
it not just on the wireless attacks but

793
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,080
also for for physical security so um

794
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,480
you know in your house i

795
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,919
you know we can come up with different

796
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,559
cases right but you know obviously you

797
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,240
know will be

798
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,320
uh whoever is doing uh

799
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,399
worth driving right the uh the people

800
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,000
who are just trying to steal you know

801
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,080
credentials and stuff like that are

802
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,240
getting into wireless access points uh

803
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,840
you know by by driving um you know they

804
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,279
uh um

805
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,120
if you have a weight password they might

806
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,399
be successful

807
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,200
uh but you know what happens if you have

808
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
uh you know some type of monitoring at

809
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,480
your house which you can um again

810
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,080
it's easy

811
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,320
you don't have a need to have a thousand

812
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,840
dollar

813
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,480
product to to help you there's a lot of

814
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,840
open source ways to do it

815
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,399
again i'm not going to spend a lot

816
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,919
there's a lot to explain about 40 aps uh

817
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,120
for wi-fi 40 gate in general uh but

818
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,039
you know this hopefully this make you

819
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,200
know opens

820
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,240
your mind regarding uh how can you

821
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,320
protect yourself from from

822
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,159
from uh from wireless attacks uh as i'm

823
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,399
let me go back to the profiles really

824
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,679
quickly

825
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,159
when you are creating or configuring

826
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,760
your profiles

827
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,919
you can specify how you want to get

828
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,360
authenticated

829
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,690
um

830
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,519
[Music]

831
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,320
let me see here

832
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,640
it's this one

833
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,799
yeah when you uh um when you create a

834
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,200
ssid you know you basically set uh you

835
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,480
know your your ip address range you know

836
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,000
so that this is where uh network

837
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,240
segmentation comes in if you use one

838
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,760
let's say your guest network talk to

839
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,960
just one

840
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,720
you know

841
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,240
that subnet is going to talk to you know

842
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,039
some

843
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,279
some subnets but not all of them this is

844
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,600
where you said it so you said that and

845
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,559
also um you said where how your name is

846
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,799
gonna be and what type of security mode

847
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,159
so we know that wpa2 uh wpa3 or at least

848
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,240
wpa2 uh it's it's good but then you you

849
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,480
want more than that right so that's why

850
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,399
you need to have some you know bigger

851
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,519
protection

852
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,960
um

853
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,360
and you know having a radio server

854
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
it's a way to do it so if you pick for

855
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,440
example

856
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,480
w 2 enterprise

857
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,639
then it gives you the option to add a

858
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,719
radio server if it's already

859
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,239
pre-configured it's going to show in

860
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,599
here unfortunately i don't have it um

861
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,918
again it wasn't the intent of

862
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,679
giving you the whole nine yards it was

863
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,839
just kind of like a follow-up of what we

864
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,918
couldn't do last month in the wireless

865
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,239
talk so

866
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,199
yeah so any questions from the audience

867
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,280
here and we're going to have like three

868
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,760
people and any questions from from you

869
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,000
guys

870
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,480
no i'm the worst salesman in the world i

871
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,440
uh

872
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,239
i i just um you know talk about it

873
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,560
because i'm familiar with it but

874
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,599
uh paulo has uh um

875
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,440
uh

876
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,880
you know a similar thing uh obviously

877
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,960
uh the most actually the most known

878
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,079
devices for wireless are the meraki from

879
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,480
from cisco so you probably know that

880
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,240
brand

881
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,480
so yeah i mean i'm just picking this one

882
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,640
because i have access to a

883
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,240
fourier gate that actually actually can

884
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,680
bring to you guys and stuff like that

885
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,000
uh

886
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,440
[Music]

887
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,880
so what was the question here why

888
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,839
foreign overseas

889
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,880
i'm not really understanding your

890
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,079
question why for an over

891
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,320
um

892
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,960
checkpoint or palo alto price

893
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,640
um

894
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,359
so

895
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,880
really depends on if you were just

896
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,760
talking about pricing you know uh it

897
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
really depends on what you're looking

898
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,800
for um

899
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,880
i have to tell you that

900
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,560
at one point

901
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,599
uh

902
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,560
40 firewalls were very cheap

903
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
and that was kind of like a

904
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
misconception that

905
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,960
they were

906
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,119
they were selling cheap products because

907
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,960
the price was cheap

908
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,280
and and just for that perception all

909
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,040
their you know

910
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,119
palo or checkpoint where like their

911
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,520
prices were higher and actually

912
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,040
companies were buying those products

913
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,280
because of that they'd rather pay more

914
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,800
because they thought that

915
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,040
having a cheap product was just gonna

916
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,520
like you know die pretty easily

917
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,760
uh but in recent times uh you know i

918
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,000
think the uh um

919
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,960
there there are is equal as the other

920
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,000
brands

921
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,720
however where they get you uh the other

922
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,880
brands is on the subscription

923
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,400
uh fortigate subscription is i think the

924
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,240
basic starts at six hundred dollars a

925
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,040
year

926
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,599
for uh threat uh

927
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,640
intelligence uh with full regard

928
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,960
um again you you don't need to have it

929
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,720
if you already have your thread intel

930
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,400
from other locations

931
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,560
uh but yeah so just in terms of pricing

932
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,280
they're they're okay um

933
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,160
i think we show a website before

934
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,920
uh it was

935
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,320
it was called firewall.com and you can

936
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,160
look at the prices with and without

937
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,800
subscription stuff like that

938
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,320
so yeah

939
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,680
any other questions from the the um

940
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,770
[Music]

941
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,880
yeah so yeah so just like i said um yeah

942
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,119
the the subscriptions with the other

943
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,520
competitors are are definitely higher

944
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,680
and you know if you're comparing you

945
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,400
know

946
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,680
on devices they all do the same they are

947
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,320
they are edge devices that you know try

948
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,000
to protect your network

949
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,960
uh

950
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,480
what happens inside your network then

951
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,359
that's a different story right uh but

952
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,640
uh overall

953
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,440
checkpoint for uh fortigates or

954
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,560
or

955
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,720
palo alto you know you can really go

956
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,520
wrong with any of those again

957
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,240
i i wish i can be a more salesperson so

958
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,720
i can make you buy forty gates but you

959
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,680
know i'm not a sales person someone two

960
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,359
you know i'm not

961
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,480
that type of person anyway so

962
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,720
anyways uh any other questions here

963
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
from the audience no

964
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,599
okay

965
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,000
all right so uh with that i'm gonna

966
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,920
conclude my talk again it wasn't really

967
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,839
a presentation or anything like that it

968
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,040

this is a talk that uh

993
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,240
i wanted to give based on

994
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,240
my own experience getting into cyber

995
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,359
security

996
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,040
and

997
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,400
uh

998
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,079
all the things that i didn't know

999
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,920
basically and all the things that i've

1000
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,720
learned um so this isn't an exhaustive

1001
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,480
list of uh

1002
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,480
acronyms by any means because we never

1003
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,040
run out um but this is

1004
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,920
a

1005
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,520
soft it to me security operations center

1006
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,759
um

1007
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,359
information technology to me

1008
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,960
so i uh

1009
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,720
one would think that getting

1010
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,880
uh a bachelor's master's in computer

1011
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
science i would hear any of the terms

1012
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,079
that uh

1013
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,359
you know we use every day but uh turns

1014
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,720
out not really

1015
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,560
um and it's really hard to have that

1016
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,920
conversation

1017
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,200
um

1018
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,680
with anyone uh when you just don't speak

1019
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,000
the same language um

1020
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,079
so

1021
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,040
this is uh

1022
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,200
this is the alphabet soup so let's go

1023
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,160
so uh here's just a here's here's just

1024
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,160
some random stuff to get some coverage

1025
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,880
you know um multi-factor authentication

1026
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,880
i feel most people

1027
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,200
have experience with vpns maybe you

1028
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,720
don't know exactly how they work but

1029
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,400
you've definitely heard of it

1030
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,280
um

1031
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,839
vpns

1032
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,880
you know everything all your data is uh

1033
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,040
sent through an encrypted tunnel

1034
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,319
so that no one

1035
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,760
supposedly can see what you're

1036
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,440
transmitting or decipher it if they get

1037
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,000
a hold of it

1038
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,000
but

1039
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,920
unless there's a deep packet inspection

1040
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,720
which various services provide or inline

1041
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,880
ssl inspection is another

1042
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,960
another

1043
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,240
term for that so

1044
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,520
it's basically to

1045
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,520
detect things at the application layer

1046
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,480
so maybe

1047
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,480
uh you know you're the coffee shop

1048
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,680
you're working in uh people can't sniff

1049
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,119
snoop and see what you're doing but um

1050
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,520
you know the it

1051
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,599
team will probably

1052
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,559
want some level of uh inspection ability

1053
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,960
so you can block certain things like you

1054
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,800
know if you're going to banking websites

1055
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,960
or whatnot but uh there's all these

1056
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,960
services that uh provide this namely um

1057
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,079
the next generation firewalls and uh

1058
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,000
secure access service edges so

1059
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,920
what are these things so

1060
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,359
um

1061
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,640
secure access service edge sassy was uh

1062
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,599
defined by gartner in 2019 in a white

1063
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,480
paper

1064
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,760
as the future of cyber security and uh i

1065
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,599
do believe that's true

1066
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,920
uh because

1067
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,440
the traditional castle remote

1068
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,359
architecture of

1069
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,680
um

1070
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,440
traditional uh

1071
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,440
corporate networks of everyone on the

1072
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,440
inside is good uh that's a there's

1073
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,960
another term for that dmz the

1074
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,119
demilitarized zone on the inside

1075
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,119
everyone's good and everyone outside the

1076
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,440
firewall outside the moat

1077
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,800
castle is bad

1078
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,319
um and with the cloud and remote work

1079
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,119
and

1080
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,559
uh

1081
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,400
basically

1082
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,839
you know there's all kinds of things

1083
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:46,160
that we can do to try and create

1084
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,760
make it seem like everyone's on the same

1085
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,839
network and multiple office locations

1086
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,119
like

1087
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,839
wide area networks wan or sd-wan

1088
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:56,000
software-defined wide area networks

1089
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,480
but uh

1090
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,880
sassy basically has all of this

1091
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,880
integrated um

1092
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,839
so

1093
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,240
you don't have to uh

1094
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,520
look in a lot of different places and uh

1095
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,200
it's it's

1096
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,040
basically one place to configure a lot

1097
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,599
of elements so what next generation

1098
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,680
firewall is

1099
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,000
um

1100
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,319
is just uh

1101
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,599
the the new

1102
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,559
the new version like the the old the old

1103
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,240
is basically like

1104
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,040
we open up a hole um you can connect in

1105
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,760
with this sort of uh

1106
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,359
protocol like ssh um

1107
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,880
or smb

1108
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,680
uh

1109
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,119
more acronyms of course uh

1110
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:43,920
but

1111
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,160
and if someone's bad we block them we

1112
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,400
put their ip on a block list but that's

1113
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,559
that's not very uh that doesn't scale

1114
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,480
that well and it doesn't have like um

1115
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,720
you know

1116
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,880
deep understanding of of the connections

1117
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,559
that are going on so uh

1118
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,720
that's just a a part of the new the new

1119
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,000
waves is he uh

1120
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,800
zero trust is just uh what they call the

1121
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,000
secure access service edge um

1122
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,880
protocol or the

1123
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,040
the uh

1124
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,680
not protocol but the

1125
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,480
the idea the idea that sassy is uh

1126
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,599
implementing is is zero trust where um

1127
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,880
there's a software defined perimeter

1128
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,119
um that provides access to a corporate

1129
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,440
network and corporate resources on a

1130
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,520
case-by-case basis

1131
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,760
instead of

1132
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,359
just trusting you once you get inside

1133
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,000
the network like with the vpn

1134
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,240
the

1135
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,559
the remote workforce basically with

1136
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,280
sassy and zero trust you can basically

1137
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,079
say

1138
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,680
everyone is remote treat everyone as

1139
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,640
remote and only allow access to the

1140
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,640
things that uh

1141
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,559
you want to allow access to

1142
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,440
instead of role-based

1143
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,599
uh well

1144
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,760
it involves role-based access control

1145
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,920
but

1146
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,280
anyway

1147
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,440
so

1148
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,720
let's just uh let's just move so what is

1149
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,559
to the the meat of this that that i

1150
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,960
actually have the experience with is a

1151
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,960
operation center so what is an operation

1152
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,680
center um so there's a lot of different

1153
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,359
ones

1154
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,119
like one one example is a network

1155
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,960
operations center um it's just

1156
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,960
a central location where it teams can

1157
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,440
continuously monitor the performance

1158
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,400
uh and health of a network

1159
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,280
so

1160
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,440
one would think operation center

1161
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,280
that that makes a lot of sense

1162
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,359
uh this is the center where all these

1163
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,280
operations are being conducted

1164
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,520
um for a security operations center uh

1165
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,520
this is a central location or team

1166
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,280
within an organization that is

1167
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,960
responsible for monitoring assessing

1168
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,800
remediating and preventing security

1169
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,400
issues so

1170
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,240
one would think networking

1171
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,040
issues is that a part of that like

1172
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,119
it's very based on

1173
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,720
the organizational

1174
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,319
uh decisions

1175
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,480
that a company makes is

1176
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,000
who who owns these different

1177
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,160
responsibilities so there are all all of

1178
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,240
these terms but

1179
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,000
they're not necessarily going to be the

1180
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,880
exact same thing company to company so

1181
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,760
like

1182
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,880
if

1183
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,520
you're a new company maybe your sock

1184
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,119
security operation center is actually a

1185
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,079
physical

1186
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,240
security operations center in the sense

1187
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,960
that it's people monitoring cameras

1188
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,640
around the outside of the office

1189
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,960
or inside the office you know so maybe

1190
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,000
the sock is that first and then you want

1191
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,220
to bring in

1192
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,480
[Music]

1193
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,319
a cyber security operation center and

1194
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,359
now you have a csoc or

1195
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,800
here's one

1196
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,760
ot

1197
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,000
operational technology

1198
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,760
if you have a water treatment

1199
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,319
electric traffic infrastructure

1200
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,079
critical infrastructure manufacturing

1201
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,079
equipment uh

1202
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,720
you can monitor all these things um but

1203
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,800
neces but issues with that stuff you

1204
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,079
don't necessarily need to go to

1205
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,880
security the security team i'm like

1206
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,800
maybe maybe you do

1207
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,960
but it's all based on the organization

1208
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,200
so

1209
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,920
like for example

1210
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,599
uh

1211
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,799
if you are a new company in the evs

1212
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,880
plate ev space

1213
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,599
where

1214
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,720
you use over-the-air ota

1215
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,400
um

1216
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,160
updates to the software on these

1217
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,520
vehicles

1218
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,040
maybe you want to have people that are

1219
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,520
monitoring what's going on in the

1220
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,480
vehicles all the time like did that

1221
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,000
update fail

1222
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,480
is there some sort of like you're

1223
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,160
wanting to be collecting all kinds of

1224
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,760
sensor data so that you can improve

1225
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,040
stuff if you're doing autonomous

1226
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,359
vehicles you know there's all kinds of

1227
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,640
uh implications of this so like even

1228
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,079
even um like monitoring a forum like you

1229
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,359
could potentially

1230
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,319
um

1231
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,400
build out uh

1232
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,280
something akin to an operations center

1233
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,079
for

1234
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,280
um

1235
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,559
just like

1236
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,240
for generating tickets for people to

1237
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,160
look at um

1238
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,480
uh for for for all the reports on your

1239
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,839
on your on your application

1240
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:35,359
so the main thing i'm going to talk

1241
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,839
about is the traditional cyber security

1242
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,559
operations center so what is

1243
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:41,920
the sock

1244
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,839
and what is what does that

1245
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,040
contain like what are the

1246
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,640
responsibilities so firstly um the first

1247
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,680
step

1248
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,520
is detection like if you can't see

1249
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,640
anything

1250
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,200
um you can't

1251
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,280
do anything you can't know you have no

1252
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,440
insight into what's actually going on

1253
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,520
good or bad so

1254
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,480
first

1255
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,200
basically is using a sim so

1256
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,640
s-i-e-m

1257
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,799
the security information and event

1258
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,200
manager you have every device every

1259
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,119
workstation every

1260
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,839
server every firewall

1261
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:18,640
every device is generating logs all the

1262
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,000
time your

1263
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,839
your web applications you know

1264
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,480
everything so

1265
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,599
to have a

1266
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:30,880
meaningful uh

1267
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,720
to be able to meaningfully respond to

1268
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,119
any of this um there's this idea of

1269
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,760
centralized logging which is essentially

1270
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,880
uh required for all kinds of compliance

1271
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,640
reasons uh if you do business with the

1272
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,720
government et cetera

1273
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,520
and

1274
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,359
they use the term single pane of glass

1275
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,599
where you want to be able to see on one

1276
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,200
screen everything that's going on um if

1277
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,720
you know

1278
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,200
there's malware installed on someone's

1279
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,599
computer um

1280
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,119
you'd want to know about it before it

1281
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,760
was brought onto the network if it's not

1282
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,880
there right now or what have you so

1283
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,720
uh threat detection

1284
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,559
and the the

1285
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,440
sock there's tier one uh and tier two

1286
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,520
analysts generally that are

1287
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,359
a hundred percent of the time uh

1288
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,280
monitoring what's going on so once your

1289
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,280
organization reaches a certain size and

1290
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,319
that because there's another term eps

1291
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,359
defense per second um how like when you

1292
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,680
think about an organization of once it

1293
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,640
reaches

1294
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,920
some critical mass i mean it depends but

1295
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,119
uh

1296
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,760
you have a lot of employees on a lot of

1297
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,799
computers a lot of servers a lot of

1298
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,280
uh everything is just generating

1299
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,680
generating information uh generating

1300
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,839
logs

1301
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,760
and uh

1302
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,839
what you need is

1303
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,520
like there's a lot of these services

1304
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,839
like uh splunk

1305
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,839
is a sim qradar sumo logic

1306
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,040
they all

1307
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,559
will apply some like machine learning

1308
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:05,920
they'll get a baseline of your

1309
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,559
environment and be able to

1310
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,799
um

1311
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,599
rate the severity of these different

1312
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,839
events of is this just an informational

1313
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,640
log is this like not useful to us is

1314
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,920
this like low risk is this medium high

1315
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,400
or critical and so most security

1316
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,079
operation centers are only dealing with

1317
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,480
high and critical logs because it's just

1318
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,960
the volume is so high and like machine

1319
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,119
learning can get better and like your

1320
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,440
models can get better but

1321
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,520
for

1322
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,640
the actual um

1323
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,760
[Music]

1324
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,079
there's still someone that has to check

1325
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,799
is this legitimate threat or is this uh

1326
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:47,440
not legitimate so there's

1327
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,680
um

1328
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,240
so because it's extremely expensive to

1329
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,000
hire people to be monitoring something

1330
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,400
24 7 365 days a year um generally

1331
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,160
uh there it's

1332
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,599
people are not

1333
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,920
all of the analysts the stock analysts

1334
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,920
are not stationed in

1335
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,559
the us maybe you have people in dallas

1336
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:09,920
london

1337
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,599
new zealand or australia or

1338
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,760
more likely india and

1339
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,200
the philippines

1340
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,200
based on cost

1341
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,359
but

1342
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,440
you know there's only

1343
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,599
it scales in the way that like

1344
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,280
there's only it takes a certain amount

1345
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,599
of time for analysts to actually resolve

1346
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,280
and remediate

1347
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,520
an issue if they find they find a

1348
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,400
problem

1349
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,359
so

1350
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:38,319
this this uh comes to like a very hot

1351
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,319
term these days soar

1352
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,880
uh security orchestration automation and

1353
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,839
response

1354
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:47,040
where um

1355
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,960
you can automate the response to these

1356
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,720
issues so if there's a phishing email

1357
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,760
reported

1358
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,720
today um you take certain actions to

1359
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,280
resolve it uh but if there's another one

1360
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,359
tomorrow are you gonna take

1361
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,720
different

1362
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,319
steps or are you going to do essentially

1363
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,319
the same thing and the answer is you're

1364
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,160
going to do essentially the same thing

1365
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,040
so

1366
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,680
maybe it takes you know 10 specific

1367
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,040
actions to validate and then

1368
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,280
you you do you have a choice of if this

1369
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,480
is

1370
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,440
legitimate uh or not you you know have a

1371
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,760
branching decision but

1372
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,480
uh what you can do with automation is

1373
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,559
take out a lot of the steps that an

1374
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,200
analyst has to do so maybe

1375
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,920
getting handling a phishing email and

1376
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,079
taking it out of the environment

1377
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,839
like

1378
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,680
it you can take that down from 30

1379
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,280
minutes to

1380
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,920
to resolve to five minutes or um

1381
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,559
so you can quantify your impact with

1382
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,119
with these automations because as it

1383
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,960
stands today uh threat detection or tdr

1384
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,599
threat detection and response is

1385
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,000
the uh sort of model for how we deal

1386
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
with security events

1387
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,760
so

1388
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,359
soar is uh

1389
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,520
is very popular right now and i would

1390
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,760
say if anyone has any programming

1391
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,599
experience and they want to get into

1392
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,839
cyber security um

1393
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,480
trying to become a sore engineer is a

1394
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,119
very uh direct way in with your

1395
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,520
previously existing skill set and uh

1396
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,000
soar will just integrate with all these

1397
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,960
different platforms your sim and all of

1398
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,760
your different you know authentication

1399
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,680
um

1400
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,880
identity

1401
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,040
and whatnot and

1402
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,079
you can

1403
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,400
suspend accounts you can create new

1404
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,880
accounts you can get information from

1405
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,559
all these places and then

1406
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,760
create a pdf for that the the analyst

1407
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,599
just has to draw a check mark on you

1408
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,359
know like uh

1409
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:48,799
there's

1410
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,640
there's so much money being spent on

1411
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,640
this monitoring constantly

1412
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,480
anything you can do to increase the

1413
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,240
number of alerts

1414
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,920
that

1415
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,000
analysts can look at per day

1416
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,319
and anything you can do to

1417
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,760
you know reduce the amount of time each

1418
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,520
analyst has to spend on an alert is like

1419
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,880
very valuable

1420
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,240
so

1421
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,640
moving on to actual threat response

1422
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,520
so

1423
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,760
this is

1424
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,680
what what you do when

1425
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,960
you

1426
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,440
recognize something is legitimate so an

1427
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,440
analyst can handle

1428
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,079
certain things like uh if you

1429
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,559
draw out a playbook for each of the

1430
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,760
different um

1431
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,839
events that can happen

1432
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,160
depending on the level uh analysts can

1433
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,960
resolve a lot of these things and if you

1434
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,880
go up the ranks of analyst you can

1435
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,599
become like a tier three analyst and

1436
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,119
every like the stuff that can't be

1437
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,599
resolved by one is escalated to two to

1438
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,839
try and resolve and if they can't do it

1439
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:48,240
or validate they escalated to three and

1440
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,640
that's like this is an incident for

1441
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,280
someone on site uh someone might get a

1442
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,520
call uh in the middle of the night uh

1443
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,280
for this is like

1444
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,400
something legitimate um that we need to

1445
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,160
address now there's a hacker in the

1446
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,680
network data is currently being

1447
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,720
exfiltrated uh et cetera

1448
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:07,920
so

1449
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,599
the there's pre-authorized actions paa

1450
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,680
that certain analysts can do

1451
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,039
uh

1452
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,079
like potentially isolate a host delete a

1453
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,680
file um

1454
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,280
but it really depends on the

1455
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,640
organization like

1456
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,400
the cyber security operations center

1457
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,200
isn't

1458
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,839
the it help desk you know like how

1459
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,480
embedded is it

1460
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,760
and the sock like um

1461
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,319
is it you know do you have to after you

1462
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,280
get a ticket as a tier three analyst do

1463
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,359
you have to create another ticket for

1464
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,359
help desk to actually do this action

1465
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,280
because you have no

1466
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,880
ability to actually

1467
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,720
remediate so

1468
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,880
there's all kinds of process

1469
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,480
that's involved in all this and it even

1470
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,400
gets more complicated if you have what's

1471
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,440
called an msoc or a managed sock where

1472
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,359
you can outsource the entire security

1473
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,839
operations center to another company a

1474
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:05,920
consulting firm or whatnot and then

1475
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,160
and then you have to

1476
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,039
and then they have actions that they can

1477
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:13,200
and can't take like just physically they

1478
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,839
don't they can't remote access in or

1479
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:18,240
maybe they do have tools to do that but

1480
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,160
you know the actions you can take like

1481
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,559
who do you actually

1482
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,119
check with for if this is a valid action

1483
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,480
that uh you're allowed to do um

1484
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,640
so

1485
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,480
so there's all kinds of things like that

1486
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,280
like service level agreements slas that

1487
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,280
define like what what you can actually

1488
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,480
do

1489
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,359
if it's an msong but uh

1490
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,200
there's other things like this managed

1491
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,160
service providers will provide

1492
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,119
like

1493
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,079
help operate it systems and most people

1494
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,079
are happy now to offload their email

1495
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:55,440
client and storage to a third party

1496
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,960
like

1497
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,319
most most organizations are pretty much

1498
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,079
on windows

1499
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:03,039
and

1500
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,599
they're happy to use microsoft

1501
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:10,400
outlook or office 365. you know um

1502
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,640
but uh like

1503
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,640
like oracle for a long time had their

1504
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,599
own email client still even with uh

1505
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,240
even with this stuff and uh it's only in

1506
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,520
the last few years that they've actually

1507
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,760
transitioned away from from using that

1508
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,799
because they didn't want to pay a

1509
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,359
competitor

1510
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,280
but you can you can use a managed

1511
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,119
service provider to do things for you

1512
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,000
but for security operations you you call

1513
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,039
that an mssp instead of an msp a managed

1514
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,039
security

1515
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,359
service provider security as a service

1516
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:42,079
but

1517
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,920
if you see here threat detection threat

1518
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,799
response threat hunting mssps kind of

1519
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,240
stop around

1520
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,400
the middle of the threat response box

1521
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,920
like they'll tell you when stuff is

1522
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,559
wrong um but they

1523
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,400
potentially aren't able to remediate

1524
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,319
that much stuff um

1525
01:05:58,319 --> 01:05:59,839
like with these pre-authorized actions

1526
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,599
what they can actually do it all depends

1527
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,960
on your contract i don't want to paint

1528
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,000
with a broad brush but

1529
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,240
there's there's a lot of elements that

1530
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,160
are involved in these things because um

1531
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,720
because of things like cti what i say in

1532
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,359
threat hunting so threat hunting is

1533
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,160
proactive searching for issues so

1534
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,319
yes we don't have we don't notice

1535
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,640
anything wrong in our environment today

1536
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,440
but

1537
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,599
do we have detections for when stuff

1538
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,920
goes wrong for

1539
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,359
one specific um issue like uh what

1540
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:34,960
fishing like do we have anything to

1541
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,039
actually report phishing like do we have

1542
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:39,359
any visibility for when people

1543
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,160
get those emails like you can

1544
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,480
have like a service like mime cast that

1545
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,480
will like all the emails will go through

1546
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,799
that and mimecast can hold on to stuff

1547
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,799
and they'll keep track of signatures and

1548
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:53,359
whatnot and

1549
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,920
basically have additional information

1550
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,599
that you don't have about

1551
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,799
emails in a much wider

1552
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:04,720
group of

1553
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,160
organizations

1554
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:06,880
so

1555
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,799
that's sort of the benefit of having a

1556
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:12,480
managed service provider or a

1557
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,280
managed soft or

1558
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,599
any of these things is you can offload a

1559
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,319
lot of this work to a group that is

1560
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:23,760
dedicated to just that one thing so cti

1561
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,039
cyber threat intelligence is um you know

1562
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,559
designed to help with detecting and

1563
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,799
preventing cyber attacks

1564
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:33,760
um it can include malware signatures

1565
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,880
known bad ip addresses domain names

1566
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,039
uh information about current cyber

1567
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,520
attack campaigns uh like all of that

1568
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,400
stuff

1569
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,880
is good to know but maybe you have one

1570
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,640
guy in house that can do that for your

1571
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,960
company but like

1572
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,599
it there's like you can sort of if

1573
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:53,440
there's a company or a vendor that's

1574
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,599
dedicated to doing that like you know

1575
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,079
crowdstrike provides all kinds of uh

1576
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,160
detections like out of the box with

1577
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,680
their with like falcon uh that like

1578
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,440
you know you can still write your own

1579
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,799
but they have

1580
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:09,359
um people that are dedicated and you

1581
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,280
know you'll your environment they can

1582
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,200
just upload like here's a thousand

1583
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,799
detections for

1584
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,479
um

1585
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,158
uh

1586
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:19,520
you know

1587
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,439
that we've seen environments so like you

1588
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,198
know you can try and look up like what

1589
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:25,520
all the malware the the hashes of all

1590
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,799
the malware that exists but like

1591
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,279
it's much more

1592
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,960
you know that's why these services are

1593
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,279
so uh expensive is because they provide

1594
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,120
a lot of value i guess uh someone's

1595
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,880
asking msoc

1596
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,080
is equivalent to mss uh

1597
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,719
i don't know what mss is

1598
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:48,439
unless you mean mssp

1599
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,550
um

1600
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:54,158
[Music]

1601
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:56,640
yeah well yeah uh but they're asking

1602
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,920
about

1603
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,839
they didn't put a p at the end so i i

1604
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:00,560
don't

1605
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,640
so so uh

1606
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,799
so if the the managed security service

1607
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,719
provider

1608
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,839
like that could be a thing they offer

1609
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,359
a managed stock

1610
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,520
consulting firms also do that sort of

1611
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,679
thing

1612
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:16,799
so

1613
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:19,198
let's see mitre attack

1614
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,120
is the other thing up there

1615
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,759
miter attack miter is actually not an

1616
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,960
acronym but attack is

1617
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,920
attack is adversarial tactics

1618
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,880
techniques and common knowledge

1619
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,640
and so it's basically a globally

1620
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,560
accessible database of adversary tactics

1621
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,520
and

1622
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,560
uh techniques based on

1623
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:44,960
real world observations and it's updated

1624
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,799
um

1625
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:50,080
yearly at least uh they

1626
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,679
they're a non-profit but they're

1627
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,120
basically

1628
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,520
funded by the government and

1629
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,400
are ties with military national research

1630
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,840
labs i believe

1631
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,560
so

1632
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:05,120
if you have all these detections right

1633
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,440
you can detect here is

1634
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,400
uh

1635
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,040
a type of attack fishing here is

1636
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,600
uh curb roasting here is

1637
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,800
uh

1638
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,679
you know uh remote code execution or or

1639
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,360
whatnot um mitre attack will have a name

1640
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,880
for each or have a yeah a name and an id

1641
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,040
a t01554

1642
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,520
uh for

1643
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,880
uh

1644
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,520
like every possible thing that

1645
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,120
can happen in an environment and it

1646
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,440
includes like initial reconnaissance and

1647
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,520
like developing capabilities so you

1648
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,360
can't really detect when

1649
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,440
a hacker is writing their own malware

1650
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,239
right but you can detect when

1651
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:48,159
uh stuff is going on in your environment

1652
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,400
and so you might get this list that you

1653
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,520
can't see

1654
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,880
from crowdstrike of a thousand

1655
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,560
detections you might get a list that you

1656
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,159
can see and upload it into your

1657
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,400
environment from an ssp

1658
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,400
um

1659
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,159
but

1660
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:02,880
uh

1661
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,040
and all of those things should be mapped

1662
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,239
to

1663
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,040
attack a miter attack tactic but you

1664
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,120
don't it doesn't necessarily cover

1665
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,280
everything and most likely it does not

1666
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,080
cover everything and even having 20

1667
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,800
detections for a certain type of a

1668
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,199
tactic doesn't mean that you're going to

1669
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,360
actually catch it like because there's

1670
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,360
um

1671
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,280
you know what is the quality of the

1672
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,120
detection that was written

1673
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:29,840
like

1674
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,760
is it going to shoot up a lot of false

1675
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,400
positives is it not actually going to

1676
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,840
catch something when it happens you know

1677
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,960
like

1678
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,640
you can write as many rules as you want

1679
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,719
it doesn't mean that they're good so

1680
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:42,719
that's what having a

1681
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,880
third party is is useful for is they

1682
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,199
are involved in many environments and

1683
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,679
they can apply the knowledge from those

1684
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,440
environments to the other environments

1685
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,199
and it's not like the conflict um

1686
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,560
because like

1687
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,320
you know the detection for a certain

1688
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:04,080
type of malware is not like

1689
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,120
i mean like crowdstrike won't let you

1690
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,480
see their detection so i guess it is

1691
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,960
their intellectual property but uh the

1692
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,920
the uh

1693
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,040
or at least they don't want to show it

1694
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,640
to you but

1695
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,280
anyhow uh so these are these these sorts

1696
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,120
of things these detections are are

1697
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,960
looking for iocs and ioas which are

1698
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,560
indicators of attack

1699
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,120
indicators of compromise um

1700
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:27,920
so

1701
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,159
you wanna it's basically any signal

1702
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,840
signature or any other evidence that

1703
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,920
points to security breach or

1704
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,760
bad behavior

1705
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,760
and so you'll get

1706
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,679
i iocs are commonly distributed in a

1707
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,920
cyber threat intelligence feed so that's

1708
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,320
the benefit of having cti

1709
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,440
you either get it directly from

1710
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,120
i mean a lot of people or a lot of

1711
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,719
organizations will get it from many

1712
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:55,120
different sources to get a good because

1713
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,840
certain organizations have

1714
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,199
are better at one thing over another

1715
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:06,000
and so um you know it it

1716
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,840
and different industries will have their

1717
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,360
own intelligence feeds like there's the

1718
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,360
auto isac i think

1719
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,679
uh that's like for everyone in the

1720
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,080
automobile industry they have

1721
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,880
a cyber threat intelligence feed that

1722
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,560
everyone can subscribe to about these

1723
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,920
are the attacks that are currently going

1724
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,640
on

1725
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,560
um or campaigns that are conducted

1726
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,760
against

1727
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,159
our manufacturing facilities for example

1728
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:29,600
um so

1729
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,440
there's all kinds of

1730
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,560
stuff out there with varying quality

1731
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,640
and so it's sort of

1732
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,600
but the idea of threat hunting is if you

1733
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,679
know this sort of attack is going on

1734
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,679
let's check our environment and see do

1735
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,440
we have detections for that

1736
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,480
one

1737
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,960
and if not

1738
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,400
well even if so

1739
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,600
let's just check

1740
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,480
and see is there evidence of

1741
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,480
these attacks that threat intelligence

1742
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,840
has told us about

1743
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,800
alternatively and then you and then you

1744
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,239
can also ask hey can you write

1745
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,080
detections for for these specific

1746
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,080
attacks because we weren't detecting

1747
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:06,800
them

1748
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,360
the the other element is um

1749
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,640
so you

1750
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,880
you can visualize there's a tool called

1751
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,600
miter navigator where uh you can

1752
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,800
visualize

1753
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,679
the miter attack matrix here's the all

1754
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,480
the entire list of all of the

1755
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:22,780
um

1756
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,159
[Music]

1757
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,760
uh possible attacks uh and like initial

1758
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,920
like ways of initial access and uh

1759
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,800
intelligence gathering etc and let's see

1760
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:35,679
um

1761
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,000
what coverage do we have

1762
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,480
so you can take all these rules that are

1763
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,520
mapped to tactics and strip them out

1764
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,159
i've written scripts to do this

1765
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:48,320
and

1766
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,159
basically you can create a visualization

1767
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:51,440
of

1768
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,760
what tactics do we have rules that cover

1769
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,120
detections

1770
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,960
and what tactics do we not

1771
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,239
and so you can get a pretty much

1772
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,760
current state right now in our

1773
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,239
organization this is what we can do what

1774
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,640
we think we can detect and this is what

1775
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,400
we have no detections for and so you can

1776
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,480
conduct a threat hunt on those things

1777
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,199
that you don't have detections for um

1778
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,600
because

1779
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,719
you would have no way of knowing

1780
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:18,159
otherwise if something was going on

1781
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:19,440
there so this can

1782
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,960
like that kind of visualization is very

1783
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,840
useful for

1784
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,640
uh

1785
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,679
strategy uh cyber transformation of like

1786
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,640
where what direction should we take uh

1787
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,159
what kind of detections need to be

1788
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,239
written and what what sort of stuff

1789
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,280
should the

1790
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,840
should the team be

1791
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,920
doing anyway so uh

1792
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,640
let's just let's keep going so ir

1793
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,520
instant response um one would think that

1794
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,920
would be always responsibility of the

1795
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,679
security operations center but that's

1796
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,480
not actually always true so if it's a

1797
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,199
managed security operations center or

1798
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,880
mssp is

1799
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,960
running this stuff

1800
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,199
you

1801
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,040
don't necessarily have access to the

1802
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,960
environment right like i said like it

1803
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,480
help desk might need to take certain

1804
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,920
actions like if this is a virtual

1805
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,080
sock that's like everyone's online like

1806
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,920
you don't actually need people

1807
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,400
sitting in the office uh

1808
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,719
looking at these uh

1809
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,159
the logs because um you know it's all

1810
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,480
in a single location you can in the

1811
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,640
cloud like you can you can just access

1812
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,760
it from anywhere so that's why you can

1813
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,239
have analysts in india or

1814
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,080
uh new zealand

1815
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,280
the uh

1816
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,840
but they because of these pre-authorized

1817
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,199
actions there's only certain things that

1818
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,920
they can actually do and you might need

1819
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,480
to email people that actually are

1820
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,080
sitting in the office building like hey

1821
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:49,040
you need to go unplug this server or or

1822
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,360
in the data center or what have you is

1823
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,360
like we need to shut this thing off but

1824
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,679
you don't have access to do it so

1825
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,640
um

1826
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,320
so a lot of times

1827
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,760
ir is

1828
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,440
um

1829
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,159
uh a part of it a part of the sock but

1830
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:07,519
it's potentially out of scope so

1831
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,280
let's just uh

1832
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,280
get into what ir actually is so there's

1833
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,800
basically four

1834
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,360
four phases according to nist another

1835
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,360
acronym uh

1836
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,839
which is

1837
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,080
the national institute of standards uh

1838
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,000
and technology and is technically part

1839
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,719
of the us department of commerce

1840
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,320
and

1841
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,080
this is extremely well known because it

1842
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,159
has a cyber security framework risk

1843
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,679
management framework

1844
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,040
uh

1845
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:42,000
nist 853 control guidance you know all

1846
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,400
kinds of things that are required if you

1847
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,639
or

1848
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,960
that are guidelines by the government to

1849
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,000
promote

1850
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
uh u.s innovation and industrial

1851
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,159
competitiveness by advancing measurement

1852
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:57,040
science standards and technologies

1853
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,040
in ways that enhance economic security

1854
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,040
and improve our quality of life

1855
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,480
um

1856
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,120
but uh

1857
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,360
they they can just be used as guidelines

1858
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,120
for how you build your cybersecurity

1859
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,719
policy

1860
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,560
so detection and analysis after

1861
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,480
preparation containment eradication

1862
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,640
recovery and then post-incident activity

1863
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,320
which is like

1864
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,920
what can we do better how can we make

1865
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,320
this process faster how could we prevent

1866
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,679
this from happening again

1867
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,360
essentially

1868
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,080
so who does it if it's not the sock

1869
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:28,960
uh

1870
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,960
potentially it's the sog but there's

1871
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,840
also all these other terms so

1872
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:34,800
uh

1873
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,880
for like internal ir teams you can also

1874
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,040
have external ir teams come in and like

1875
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,640
do all the analysis

1876
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,040
there's a lot of money in that

1877
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,159
but the

1878
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:49,120
c cert stands for computer security

1879
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,719
incident response team

1880
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:53,040
which is a concrete organizational

1881
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,880
entity that is assigned the

1882
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,440
responsibility of coordinating and

1883
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,360
supporting the response to a computer

1884
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,960
security event or incident

1885
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,120
cert

1886
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,400
is

1887
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,800
a computer emergency response or

1888
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,880
readiness team they're basically

1889
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,520
interchangeable um there's also

1890
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,600
um

1891
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,280
yeah there's other names for this stuff

1892
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,800
but

1893
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:19,679
um

1894
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:22,159
if you're it like if you light fireworks

1895
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,480
out behind the bank and everyone rushes

1896
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,320
out like what is going on or like light

1897
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,320
a fire in a garbage can or whatever you

1898
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,560
can just walk in the front door you know

1899
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,360
like

1900
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,080
that's sort of the the

1901
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,480
the implication is like we need security

1902
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,440
events and incidents dealt with

1903
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,440
constantly like the analysts need to

1904
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,280
continue looking at the events because

1905
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,360
there's ever events coming in every

1906
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,400
minute you know um so you need to have

1907
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,520
these people

1908
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,560
remediating uh other issues i mean maybe

1909
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,080
there's a fire going on but uh

1910
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,320
like or con like

1911
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,199
the the normal operations can't cease

1912
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:03,520
when there's a big event so having

1913
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,480
having

1914
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,080
they people they might get drafted for

1915
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,800
certain tasks but um

1916
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,880
that's the idea of having a instant

1917
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,159
response

1918
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:13,920
coordinator or

1919
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,239
in the network operations center they'll

1920
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:19,839
call it a incident commander

1921
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:21,760
basically this uh

1922
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,480
this

1923
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,400
the person that's like in charge of

1924
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,440
resolving this and has the authority to

1925
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,520
tell people what to do when

1926
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,239
uh stuff needs to get done immediately

1927
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:35,040
so um

1928
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,120
but there's other other things going on

1929
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,159
in

1930
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:46,280
in it security other than um

1931
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,600
these elements there's related but

1932
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,639
we have

1933
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,960
data loss prevention which is an element

1934
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,639
of some of these things like

1935
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:55,760
uh

1936
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,360
it can be worked into various

1937
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,920
technologies but like detecting like

1938
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,239
these detections are we seeing

1939
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,480
um

1940
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,600
you know files uh that are

1941
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,239
a certain size going out are we seeing

1942
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,719
files sent out on a like a very regular

1943
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,159
basis we see you know one detection i

1944
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,639
thought of is like someone sending

1945
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:20,880
um

1946
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:22,639
like vacation photos to their work

1947
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:25,120
account and then like sending them back

1948
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,080
why would they do that and you can see

1949
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,560
oh these files changed in size or one of

1950
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,679
these files changed in size um

1951
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:36,400
they've hidden you know that you can use

1952
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,920
uh steganography and hide information in

1953
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,199
inside of

1954
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,440
like a bunch of text or documents that

1955
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,639
you're trying to explicate but a lot of

1956
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,080
people aren't that

1957
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,159
complic that that

1958
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,000
you know

1959
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,800
over the top an insider threat

1960
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,679
like

1961
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,600
you know like i was

1962
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,360
one organization

1963
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,040
uh wanted me to

1964
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,040
do like uh

1965
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,000
some sort of uh

1966
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,440
sentiment analysis on users emails that

1967
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,400
we're leaving the company um to see

1968
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,239
are are they hap do they like the

1969
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:17,600
company uh would they potentially

1970
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,040
be

1971
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,639
uh

1972
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,719
would they potentially steal data

1973
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,800
and it's like okay like we could do that

1974
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,760
but we don't have a usb

1975
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,760
policy so

1976
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,159
like they can just download

1977
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:33,760
everything they want on a usb and we

1978
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,199
have no visibility into that so we

1979
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,280
should probably

1980
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,679
deal with other things first before we

1981
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:41,199
you know

1982
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:42,239
do this

1983
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:45,840
uh all kinds of i mean

1984
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,120
something that i don't think is

1985
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,440
appropriate anyway but uh user behavior

1986
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,600
analytics um this is sort of

1987
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,920
uh that is getting a baseline of how

1988
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,480
users behave um all of a sudden someone

1989
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,320
in finance is running a bunch of

1990
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,159
powershell scripts why are they using

1991
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:03,679
powershell when they've never used

1992
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:06,080
powershell before i mean powershell is

1993
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,920
already probably going to trigger

1994
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,560
certain detections um

1995
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,800
but uh being able to

1996
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,840
this can be role based um but it's also

1997
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,120
uh

1998
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,360
but i think a lot of the the uba stuff

1999
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,440
is uh

2000
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,280
uh

2001
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,760
it's like it's to detect insider threats

2002
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,480
and

2003
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,320
um

2004
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,880
and whatnot but i don't know

2005
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,280
the the ver the

2006
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,080
how good the actual um

2007
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,120
analytics are is variable um depending

2008
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,760
on which which service you're using but

2009
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,679
um there's all kinds of stuff you can do

2010
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,920
with this too in fraud prevention like

2011
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,719
where you click on in the site you know

2012
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,639
how users click on something is very

2013
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,360
different from how a robot will send a

2014
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,880
request right or

2015
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,560
um

2016
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,520
uh

2017
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,920
here so to go on identity and access

2018
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,639
management iam privileged access

2019
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,440
management is uh an element of that it's

2020
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,239
like

2021
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:09,120
uh do you you probably want some some

2022
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,800
insight into who are the privileged

2023
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,440
users in addition to the normal users

2024
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,920
because privileged users have privileges

2025
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:16,880
to

2026
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,040
to act uh

2027
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,360
to do more dangerous things potentially

2028
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,280
um like with access to servers and

2029
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,679
whatnot and so uh

2030
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,840
you wanna see you wanna have visibility

2031
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,239
huh this this account this admin account

2032
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:33,920
hasn't been used in months it's stale

2033
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,960
do we need it anymore like who who owns

2034
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,760
this process at all um

2035
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,400
i am uh

2036
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,639
and pam one of the pam products is

2037
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:47,040
cyberark um

2038
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,320
uh vm

2039
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,080
uh also

2040
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:50,880
uh

2041
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,920
vm is vulnerability management um where

2042
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,520
you might wanna get

2043
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,080
all like if your company you know you

2044
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,400
have a startup and you're just like

2045
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,719
scale growing scaling really fast you

2046
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,880
know you're building all these uh you

2047
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,560
know applications or websites or what

2048
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,280
have you you might get um

2049
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,800
you might have a lot of ips that you

2050
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,120
don't even know about that you own

2051
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:13,920
um

2052
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,520
so how do you get

2053
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,480
how do you install like uh agents on

2054
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,639
every computer to have visibility how do

2055
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,840
you know what you even own

2056
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,239
and how do you patch that and how do you

2057
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:28,480
push out these changes so another name

2058
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,320
for that is uh threat exposure

2059
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,000
management like

2060
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,120
uh

2061
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,480
people can come up with whatever

2062
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,639
acronyms they want but uh those two are

2063
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,400
uh basically the same

2064
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,480
attack surface management attack surface

2065
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:45,040
reduction or the same thing uh asm asr

2066
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,639
it's all about

2067
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:50,480
the process of reducing um

2068
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:51,920
but uh

2069
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,400
the possible avenues for attack so

2070
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,480
you know maybe all your users

2071
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,239
uh have

2072
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:00,320
their rdp part open like all the

2073
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,080
workstations just have that open because

2074
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,120
it was never

2075
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,679
there's no policy to close it

2076
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:07,520
and you see in the logs hey there's all

2077
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,880
these failed attempts on all these

2078
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,320
workstations that

2079
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,880
like people are trying to authenticate

2080
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,560
on on this port

2081
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,320
but there's no need for that at all

2082
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,239
because there's

2083
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,120
like applications that we use um

2084
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,600
you know uh

2085
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,560
that don't require uh

2086
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,480
like the port to be specifically open

2087
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,080
like you just run the application and it

2088
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,920
will make the connection i mean i still

2089
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,520
use the same protocol but um

2090
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,520
you don't need to have that open for

2091
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,760
just in the caf

2092
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,000
in the coffee shop and have anyone try

2093
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,239
and authenticate to your remote desktop

2094
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:47,440
uh right so um

2095
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,840
uh and the last thing is uh governance

2096
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,719
uh risk management and compliance grc

2097
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:57,280
this is a really big one uh it's

2098
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,520
it's basically

2099
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,520
all of the the policy stuff that you

2100
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,520
have to worry about um with uh

2101
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,040
like

2102
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:10,800
grc is that the team that's

2103
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,960
that helps organize

2104
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,080
uh it and security risks and

2105
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,840
make sure you're meeting compliance

2106
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,080
requirements so if you deal with a

2107
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,000
certain number of transactions per day

2108
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,080
you're probably having to look at pci

2109
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,560
dss which is the payment card industry

2110
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,159
data security standard

2111
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,920
um

2112
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,840
so you know that they're accepting

2113
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,440
processing storing or transmitting

2114
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,639
credit card info um securely

2115
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:37,920
um

2116
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,280
and a lot of

2117
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,920
one of the things for that is if you

2118
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,400
have uh if you manage payments on your

2119
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,199
web app or what have you uh people will

2120
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:50,000
use a third party like stripe because

2121
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,719
why take on the risk yourself to develop

2122
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:55,840
your own payment processing thing um and

2123
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,000
like store credit card information or

2124
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,440
whatnot when there's people that are

2125
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,360
dedicated to doing those things so it

2126
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,280
may as well just

2127
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,800
you know

2128
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,480
use another service but

2129
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,360
you know

2130
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,760
people are compromised all the time so

2131
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,159
whether it's you or supply chain or one

2132
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:14,080
of your managed service providers you

2133
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,120
know

2134
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,480
it's all a gamble but uh you know

2135
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,480
then there's hipaa

2136
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,400
the health insurance portability and

2137
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,480
accountability act

2138
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,000
so about

2139
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,440
storing health information and pii

2140
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,679
another acronym personally identifiable

2141
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:33,520
information um

2142
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,000
because patients

2143
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,360
that information can't be released

2144
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,280
without patient's consent or knowledge

2145
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,280
and so there's all kinds of requirements

2146
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:45,199
for hipaa so every every uh

2147
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,920
hospital that you know of probably has a

2148
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,560
pretty large security operations center

2149
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,000
because they have to

2150
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,679
manage their target and they also have

2151
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:54,800
to manage

2152
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,679
all this information gdpr you might have

2153
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,080
heard of is the general data protection

2154
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,679
regulation

2155
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,120
which is for

2156
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,280
data privacy in europe but a lot of u.s

2157
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,199
companies are also following those

2158
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:09,440
regulations

2159
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,679
so that uh they can do business in

2160
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,760
europe um

2161
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,280
and uh

2162
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,080
just to to close it out i'm going to

2163
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,400
have just some common attack acronyms

2164
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,920
because you know

2165
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,880
uh those are fun uh xss cross-site

2166
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:25,920
scripting

2167
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,000
um

2168
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,639
stored or reflected user input

2169
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:31,600
uh

2170
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,920
when when it's unsanitized

2171
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:37,120
uh the browser can execute code on uh

2172
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,840
the client's behalf

2173
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,520
then we have xs rf cross site request

2174
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,800
forgery

2175
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,480
i guess this is this technically an

2176
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,520
acronym if you use x for cross

2177
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,639
i don't know

2178
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:52,480
it might have a specific term

2179
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,480
um

2180
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,760
but uh this is

2181
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,520
uh pretending to be another user

2182
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,960
stealing session token that sort of

2183
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,639
thing um

2184
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:03,920
exploits trust users trust in a website

2185
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,639
uh xsrf leverages browser's trust for

2186
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:07,840
the site

2187
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:12,400
xml or xxe this is a nested acronym uh

2188
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,600
xml external entities xml is external

2189
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,600
extensible markup language so this is

2190
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,199
extensible markup language external

2191
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,760
entities

2192
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,440
and this can lead to remote code

2193
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,639
execution

2194
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,400
uh denial service or information

2195
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,560
disclosure which i will get into in just

2196
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,480
a second rce

2197
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,960
is more of an attack outcome than an

2198
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,080
attack itself i guess uh that

2199
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,639
you're able to execute arbitrary code on

2200
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,520
a host remotely and such an attack may

2201
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,239
be assigned to cve which is a common

2202
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,800
vulnerabilities and exposures which is

2203
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,880
a list of publicly

2204
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,080
disclosed

2205
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,239
computer security flaws

2206
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,400
and if you want software uh security

2207
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,040
flaws you can go to cwe which is the

2208
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,360
common weakness the common weakness

2209
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,520
enumeration

2210
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,840
which is a category for

2211
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,840
a category system for hardware and

2212
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,120
software weaknesses and vulnerabilities

2213
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,880
so uh

2214
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,880
and it's a pretty big deal like if you

2215
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,880
have find a a vulnerability that hasn't

2216
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,400
previously been found

2217
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,199
you can get a cve assigned get a number

2218
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:21,040
and you know that's that's a nice

2219
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,719
feather in your cap in the security

2220
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,120
industry

2221
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,239
and you can also you can also get them

2222
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:31,760
by being an analyst and seeing uh on the

2223
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,440
front line right and seeing the

2224
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,880
um

2225
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,560
impact of

2226
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,400
a exploit that's previously never been

2227
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,400
seen so maybe your network is being

2228
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:46,400
exploited by a new outlook vulnerability

2229
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,000
or something

2230
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,560
and you can reverse engineer it or

2231
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,239
figure out what happened and then

2232
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:53,840
potentially get a cv to your name

2233
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:56,800
because you know the apt the advanced

2234
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,719
persistent threat team

2235
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:00,239
advanced persistent threat like the

2236
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:02,560
hacker group that is attacking you with

2237
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,480
this previously

2238
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,199
not before seen exploit um isn't going

2239
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:09,520
to necessarily claim it uh with their

2240
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,679
with their name and uh get a cve

2241
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,600
assigned just for uh

2242
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,040
you know for

2243
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:18,960
infamy or whatever but uh uh

2244
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,199
anyway uh

2245
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,520
lastly uh is ddos

2246
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,000
or dos uh distributed denial of service

2247
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,560
or denial of service

2248
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,120
this isn't

2249
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:35,920
an attack as much as the outcome of

2250
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,880
like a tool you're running

2251
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,199
there are many ways to go about it um

2252
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,679
but it's it's generally just bombing a

2253
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:45,679
target with a lot of uh it's like going

2254
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,120
to a sandwich shop

2255
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,639
and uh

2256
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:50,080
ordering a sandwich and then walking

2257
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,639
away and getting your friend to do that

2258
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,560
and then like you just all of a sudden

2259
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,000
there's all these

2260
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,920
sandwiches being made that

2261
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,760
there's no one to pick them up and then

2262
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,080
all the actual users that

2263
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,320
the actual people that want to get one

2264
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,120
um you know are blocked from actually

2265
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,440
using it they're getting it so that's uh

2266
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,960
that's that's my talk um if you

2267
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,920
have any questions i

2268
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,639
would love to hear them

2269
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,760
how up-to-date the the standards bodies

2270
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:32,159
are with the acronyms um

2271
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:34,840
they're up to date with the acronyms but

2272
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,400
there's

2273
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,600
like

2274
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,840
there's all kinds of names that

2275
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,080
like companies will have for stuff that

2276
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,560
won't miss it like like i said with uh

2277
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,280
you know that if you are doing

2278
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,199
um

2279
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:50,880
like

2280
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:54,000
the the ot stuff like uh

2281
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,040
uh and

2282
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,840
the operational technology um

2283
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,159
and it's a it's like a over-the-air or

2284
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:01,360
you know it's a vehicle like you could

2285
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,000
have a vehicle sock right and then call

2286
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,960
that visa and it's like that that

2287
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,719
acronym didn't exist until like right

2288
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:11,120
now right or like until the you know

2289
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,199
tesla might have a v stock i don't know

2290
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:14,400
um

2291
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,880
but the the

2292
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,800
the uh

2293
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,880
there's terms like like like certain

2294
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,040
people that i've talked to that work at

2295
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,199
like national laboratories doing cyber

2296
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,040
exploitation engineering

2297
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,080
research

2298
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,120
uh like they're not happy with with nist

2299
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,440
they think it's behind the times you

2300
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:36,159
know because they're on the front line

2301
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:37,679
developing the

2302
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,520
new thing right

2303
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,480
so

2304
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,520
so like

2305
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,159
people people will say that

2306
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:46,880
the the standards for

2307
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,280
um like critical infrastructure

2308
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,679
um industrial control systems are not

2309
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:52,880
very good

2310
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,320
um they're not really up to date like i

2311
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,880
i interviewed once at um

2312
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,520
industrial control systems uh

2313
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,560
the consulting firm and uh

2314
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,480
they were

2315
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,360
taking down the network like like they

2316
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,480
were drawing network diagrams on paper

2317
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,719
um they didn't know what devices they

2318
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:15,520
had

2319
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,280
and so it's like yeah you can conduct a

2320
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,360
penetration test to be in compliance

2321
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:21,280
every year but like

2322
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,679
like if you have no detection

2323
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:25,760
like how you know it's like

2324
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,119
so

2325
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:29,840
and also like the stuff with sassy um

2326
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,960
like

2327
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,480
the language used in some nist documents

2328
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,639
like has a very

2329
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,040
you know it's the standard and so that

2330
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:40,880
means that

2331
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,880
this is how you should build your

2332
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,600
network and so ideas that go

2333
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,960
away from like this explicitly defined

2334
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,239
mindset or model um are not included

2335
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:52,960
like

2336
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:56,400
this idea of sassy is very new secure

2337
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,320
access service edge

2338
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:02,560
it's very popular now but uh the

2339
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,040
the uh

2340
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,920
you know the

2341
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,000
i mean nist had to be updated to include

2342
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,719
that right like uh gartner came up with

2343
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:16,480
that term first right so i like uh it's

2344
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,400
it's mostly up-to-date i don't know if

2345
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,239
any anyone else has thoughts on this

2346
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:24,639
um you know

2347
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:27,360
i mean the only thing is like as new uh

2348
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:30,880
technologies like you you said

2349
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,440
we have new technologies um

2350
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,560
you know

2351
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,199
they come up with new acronyms right and

2352
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:39,679
also like for example vm

2353
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:41,440
in security is vulnerability management

2354
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,920
but in 90 dm it's a virtual machine

2355
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,080
right so then you just have to

2356
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:49,119
with acronyms uh i mean acronyms have

2357
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,520
maybe the context right you can to look

2358
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,600
for the context of the conversation

2359
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:56,320
because if you're in an iq conversation

2360
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,239
and you're a secure person when you walk

2361
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:01,280
in and say we're talking about vms vms

2362
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,360
to me we will have vulnerability

2363
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,040
management where for them will be a

2364
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:08,320
virtual machine right yeah so uh

2365
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,080
again uh we

2366
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:12,159
this is this was by the way this was a

2367
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:13,920
great presentation because

2368
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:14,800
uh

2369
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,800
it shows a lot of the acronyms that we

2370
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,480
use in in the industry uh so whether

2371
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,400
you're applying for jobs or whether you

2372
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,080
are in a in a

2373
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:27,679
in a call with uh executives uh talking

2374
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:29,840
about security those are the terms that

2375
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,760
you know you need to emphasize and if

2376
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,080
you want them to understand so you know

2377
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,679
you can be on the same page

2378
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:36,960
yeah because

2379
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,800
like when you think about

2380
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,400
product security

2381
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,320
that's like a different issue right like

2382
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,960
what i'm talking about is generally

2383
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,800
security operations

2384
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,760
like corporate i t security operations

2385
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,760
right and there's a lot of terms

2386
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,800
involved in that um

2387
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,239
but like

2388
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:57,280
you know

2389
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:58,159
there's

2390
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:00,480
if you're going into a web application

2391
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,639
security environment like none of the

2392
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:04,560
like you know maybe this is relevant

2393
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,719
like if the alerts

2394
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:07,520
get

2395
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,400
piped into your your alert

2396
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,159
like uh centralized logging

2397
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,480
infrastructure but the

2398
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,960
uh you know

2399
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,639
i i guess like why this was interesting

2400
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:24,080
for me was i had no idea right about any

2401
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,600
of these things i didn't know what a

2402
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,760
sock was i hadn't heard of sim i hadn't

2403
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,239
heard of soar i hadn't heard of any of

2404
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:33,040
this stuff in my six years in college

2405
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:36,639
doing computery things and uh

2406
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:39,360
you know like

2407
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:45,239
like i think it's interesting who

2408
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,440
who actually

2409
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,040
like has this information or like the

2410
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,199
real world information or even even just

2411
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:56,400
i t like how do you how do you start in

2412
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,119
in cyber security with you if you don't

2413
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:00,639
like understand how operations are

2414
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:02,320
working today so maybe you want to you

2415
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:03,920
want to shatter this you want to disrupt

2416
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,719
this this system like you think like you

2417
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,040
know it doesn't scale i mean it scales

2418
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,719
by throwing more and more money at it

2419
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:12,400
like right you can have

2420
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,400
more analysts dealing with more events

2421
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,080
per day you can

2422
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:19,679
like refine your your and tune your uh

2423
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:22,000
your monitoring um

2424
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,639
so that like your detections are better

2425
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,440
so maybe this isn't actually a high high

2426
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,760
high severity issue this is actually

2427
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,320
a medium or it's not an issue and so

2428
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:35,600
like yes you can get better um at that

2429
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,480
stuff but they're still like the mindset

2430
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,560
is still like this is how we conduct

2431
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,400
operations like

2432
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,600
potentially like you know potentially

2433
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,600
i don't know i don't want to run my site

2434
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,280
24 hours a day i'm just going to have it

2435
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,880
be open you know 12 hours a day and then

2436
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,199
people go to it at night like oh well

2437
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,040
like like that's not a conversation that

2438
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,199
people have but you could

2439
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:00,639
you know like there's all kinds of

2440
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:02,239
things that you could do that would

2441
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:06,800
break this mold um that would change how

2442
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:07,679
like

2443
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:09,600
how this works um

2444
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,639
like

2445
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:12,400
maybe you maybe you don't want to do any

2446
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:13,840
detections

2447
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,679
at this level and all you want to check

2448
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:18,400
is network traffic that's like

2449
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,840
um

2450
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,600
you know looking for data being

2451
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,119
exfiltrated or looking for command and

2452
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:25,440
control stuff like if

2453
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,600
if a machine has been hacked and they're

2454
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,600
sending out information or

2455
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,199
you know they they have to phone home

2456
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,360
every so often and they'll try and apply

2457
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,960
some jitter so that

2458
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,960
they can't be tracked as easily but over

2459
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,960
a long enough period you'll see

2460
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,639
someone is phoning home

2461
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:41,920
uh

2462
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:44,480
you know every day or every week

2463
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,520
and like we don't know where this

2464
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,920
connection is going it's like okay so we

2465
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,199
don't do any of those detections we

2466
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:50,719
don't deal with all these logs all we

2467
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:52,159
look at is

2468
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,199
uh

2469
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:54,960
just just network because the network

2470
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,719
doesn't lie and we're just going to do

2471
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:59,440
thread hunting on every box like

2472
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,840
you know like that that's an option

2473
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,840
right but like there's all kinds of

2474
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:06,080
security standards that

2475
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,400
you know cover all the bases for every

2476
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,960
size of organization um

2477
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,360
for the most part uh i mean

2478
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,119
uh but uh

2479
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:17,840
you know like it's entirely like there's

2480
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,040
plenty of startups that don't have

2481
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,480
security

2482
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,280
teams like or it's just one person

2483
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,159
you know like you can't uh

2484
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:27,520
it's

2485
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:30,000
you know you don't have like

2486
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,400
i mean who needs ir if you don't even

2487
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:35,520
know that you lost your information like

2488
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,800
like uh

2489
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,880
you know but if you want to be compliant

2490
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,920
you want to do business with the

2491
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,600
government you want to do transactions

2492
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,040
you want to

2493
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,960
like you know

2494
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:46,560
deal with credit card information you

2495
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:49,360
want to um deal with health health in

2496
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,000
the health care industry it's like okay

2497
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,639
the model is you need centralized

2498
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:57,520
logging that's just the way it is so

2499
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,199
um

2500
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:02,560
uh so even if even if uh

2501
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,639
detections or like

2502
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:06,880
dwell time right the dwell time the

2503
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,800
amount of time hackers are in a network

2504
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,960
before people find out about it so all

2505
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,119
time is going on right

2506
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:14,639
uh it's like

2507
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:16,320
and it's like it can be up to eighty

2508
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,520
like eighty

2509
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,560
forty days two years 380 days then we

2510
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,280
went to like less and then

2511
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,360
now i see the numbers of going up and

2512
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,400
down

2513
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,239
there are some organizations that it's

2514
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,639
like being notified by the hackers that

2515
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:32,960
you've been hacked counts as finding out

2516
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,639
that hacker is in your network

2517
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:37,440
so yeah the wall time of

2518
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,239
someone who doesn't have any any type of

2519
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:42,560
managed services like manage stock or

2520
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,960
mssb or anything like that

2521
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,440
it could be up to 180 days or more

2522
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,600
definitely yeah but if you have uh

2523
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,679
practice services you know like manage

2524
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:53,440
stocks and stuff like that

2525
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,679
you know you can be alerted

2526
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:56,560
like

2527
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,760
if not in in

2528
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,920
in minutes or hours

2529
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,400
uh it could go up to like you know as

2530
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:07,280
far as like 40 days 30 days

2531
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:10,320
it really depends on on what is the

2532
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,040
managed service doing and and what

2533
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,040
technology you're using right yeah

2534
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,400
because like it's based on your

2535
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,320
detections like maybe you didn't detect

2536
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,760
them coming in maybe you didn't detect

2537
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,520
them detect them scanning the network

2538
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,199
which you probably should have but and

2539
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:25,840
and swift like pivoting and getting into

2540
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,840
other computers but then and like

2541
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,600
getting the data accessing the database

2542
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,280
but as soon as they try and exfiltrate

2543
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,520
it and send it out maybe you detect that

2544
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,440
right so like they could be in the

2545
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,199
network doing all this stuff for a long

2546
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,199
time but if like

2547
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:41,600
i mean one idea is like

2548
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:43,679
you know who cares if we have hackers in

2549
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:44,880
the network if they're not doing

2550
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:45,840
anything

2551
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,760
right like if we have command and

2552
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,880
control you know you know like

2553
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:53,440
a machine that's been uh that pain like

2554
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,400
sends out like a few packets every every

2555
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,040
day or whatever like it's just passing

2556
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,000
by to

2557
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,320
medal with the elections for instance

2558
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,320
yeah i mean like

2559
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,800
you know like

2560
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,360
you can so anyway like

2561
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,280
there's a lot of ways

2562
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,719
i think that

2563
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:15,040
we could potentially

2564
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,679
change how we do things but once you

2565
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:20,400
reach a certain size of organization

2566
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,719
it like it doesn't really

2567
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:23,840
i

2568
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,760
i trust the

2569
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,360
the standards like trying to do your own

2570
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:32,000
but you know i'm i'm interested like if

2571
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,679
you go to rsa

2572
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:36,159
conference they have every security

2573
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:38,000
product company

2574
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:38,960
and

2575
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:42,000
uh shows up there basically and there

2576
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,920
there's interest like uh there was a bay

2577
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,840
area owasp meetup

2578
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,520
where a raleigh network spoke and they

2579
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,360
have like this pretty

2580
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:52,080
new idea for how you deal with like

2581
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,480
application security um

2582
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,159
uh

2583
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,119
and

2584
01:44:57,119 --> 01:44:59,600
or it's like iam for apps

2585
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,320
and uh and they're like in the top 10

2586
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:03,520
like

2587
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,600
our rsa has like a list of

2588
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,880
you know

2589
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,480
exciting new companies or whatever and

2590
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,080
they're they're in that list so i mean

2591
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,760
like maybe maybe

2592
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,199
they're going to be like the new

2593
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,560
standard or whatever we're just going to

2594
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:17,600
do things their way um but you know in

2595
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,280
all likelihood like

2596
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,080
uh

2597
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,040
this is

2598
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,800
this is what has

2599
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:26,320
been working for the most part and uh

2600
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:29,360
is most quantifiable and um

2601
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:30,639
like uh

2602
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:31,440
yeah

2603
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,760
but this is not really static right some

2604
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,199
of that right

2605
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:37,040
stuff it's already getting compressed to

2606
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,520
ssc

2607
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,040
that's secure

2608
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,199
on this yeah yeah

2609
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:44,400
yeah so

2610
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,440
sse instead of sassy another one but uh

2611
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,520
yeah like there's all kinds of things

2612
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:52,639
that maybe a monthly update

2613
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:55,119
yeah well well there's like

2614
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:56,080
there's

2615
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,679
there was a slide and you know i don't

2616
01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:00,000
have that presentation but they had like

2617
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,080
a company a vendor for each of the

2618
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,719
different types of like zero trust

2619
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:06,159
things you can have it like every

2620
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:09,119
different layer um and so like you know

2621
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:12,880
z scaler or uh i think twin gate is a

2622
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:16,000
startup that does it too but the

2623
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,719
and that scope has it and i'm not i'm

2624
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:21,119
not fully up to date on all of the the

2625
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:24,080
vendors but the

2626
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,239
um

2627
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:27,600
the

2628
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,400
like

2629
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,320
a lot of that stuff can is sold as like

2630
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,480
a replacement for vpn

2631
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,960
you know so like that's just one part of

2632
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:37,840
this entire infrastructure like um why

2633
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:42,080
companies um like have a a

2634
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:45,840
keep acquiring other security things is

2635
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,679
why security companies or or just tech

2636
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:48,880
companies acquire all these security

2637
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,800
things like fortnite is to have a

2638
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,760
product for every single part

2639
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,679
of

2640
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:58,480
security so that you don't have to buy a

2641
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:00,800
hundred projects products which is

2642
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:03,600
still the case that you have

2643
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,239
tens of products but anyway uh there's a

2644
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:08,000
couple people that ask some questions in

2645
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,119
chat so

2646
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:10,800
is the implication that more acronyms

2647
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,239
you have implemented the more mature the

2648
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:13,760
org um

2649
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,679
i i wouldn't say

2650
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,840
explicitly that um

2651
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:22,520
i would say uh

2652
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:23,920
like

2653
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,400
the the

2654
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,760
there's a couple there's a couple ways

2655
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:29,520
of looking at that i guess like there

2656
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,960
are standards

2657
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,320
that

2658
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:36,239
are acronyms like uh you know oasp asvs

2659
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:39,040
is their application

2660
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,119
uh security vulnerability standard i

2661
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:43,920
believe which is like a testable way of

2662
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,119
seeing does your is your web application

2663
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:48,159
secure

2664
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:50,000
do you meet all these things uh then

2665
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,040
there's like

2666
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:51,920
uh

2667
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:53,360
things

2668
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:56,320
that are more organizational changes so

2669
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,480
like yes there's a lot of acronyms like

2670
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:02,000
owasp sam it's like over like this you

2671
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,719
know three year period like how how many

2672
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:06,639
of these elements have you implemented

2673
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:09,360
into your secure development life cycle

2674
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,159
um or or what have you so

2675
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:15,040
um it's not necessarily how many

2676
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:17,440
acronyms you have because like

2677
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,800
right like uh

2678
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,960
how many socks you need

2679
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:24,159
like um how many like but you know

2680
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,880
having hitting up like i like having

2681
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,760
identity and access management you know

2682
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,520
being having grc having having um

2683
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,040
a sock like

2684
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,639
having vulnerability management like

2685
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,639
those things are important but they're

2686
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:39,840
also

2687
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,239
vague and the definition

2688
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:45,360
is not static so the

2689
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:47,839
um

2690
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,800
some are more static than others but the

2691
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,480
uh

2692
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:55,040
yeah it's not necessarily that the more

2693
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,480
acronyms you have the better you are

2694
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,639
because you know

2695
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:01,920
anyway uh so are my slides available uh

2696
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:05,600
i i could make them available

2697
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,800
and uh do you have any go-to resources

2698
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,159
you would recommend for someone who's

2699
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:13,440
starting out on their journey in

2700
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,480
security

2701
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:18,159
well um acronyms wise uh i've already

2702
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:20,320
covered that but the

2703
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,560
the uh

2704
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,239
uh

2705
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:25,440
i guess

2706
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,440
the answer

2707
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,560
is like

2708
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,280
what do you want to do in security right

2709
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,639
i think that's the most important

2710
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:35,840
question that everybody who wants to

2711
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,000
cross right into this field is

2712
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
what is what do you see yourself doing

2713
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,719
right you see yourself being a blue

2714
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:43,840
teamer

2715
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,920
uh then you know there's a lot of

2716
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,520
resources for that

2717
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:51,520
if you want to do uh penetration testing

2718
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,920
then there is a whole you know path for

2719
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,719
that

2720
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:58,560
you want to do risk management i mean

2721
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:00,719
there's a whole thing to that

2722
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:03,040
it really really depends on where you're

2723
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,119
infrastructure right

2724
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:06,880
you know setting all these devices like

2725
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,400
the firewalls and

2726
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,880
that that's also that's not really a lot

2727
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,880
of ip that's also

2728
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,920
you know it has that you know ip

2729
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,280
uh

2730
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,880
thing but you know because you're

2731
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,119
touching hardware and troubleshooting

2732
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:22,480
and stuff like that but

2733
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:23,360
you know

2734
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,199
in order to configure

2735
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:27,360
uh those security devices to

2736
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,760
must have a security background

2737
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:30,719
you know

2738
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,800
but that doesn't mean that's gonna make

2739
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,119
you an engine responder or is gonna make

2740
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:36,960
your penetration sensor or actual

2741
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,360
penetration tester will be the closest

2742
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,119
thing to it because you know how to

2743
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:43,040
configure those devices you know the

2744
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:44,000
baseline

2745
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,119
you know

2746
01:50:45,119 --> 01:50:46,800
then make sure you know how to attack

2747
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:49,040
those devices

2748
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,639
those devices so

2749
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,400
yeah um

2750
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,840
like i got started because i was

2751
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,960
interested in pen test well

2752
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,239
the whole story how i got into it

2753
01:50:58,239 --> 01:51:00,000
initially but one of the things i was

2754
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,560
interested in was pen testing and as you

2755
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:05,840
start doing that like maybe you'll see

2756
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,800
you'll learn more terms right like you

2757
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,000
don't know all of the

2758
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,159
services that run on a computer you

2759
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:15,920
don't know how linux

2760
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,840
works compared to windows and how

2761
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:20,800
exploitation works like if you don't

2762
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,760
have any experience in it with

2763
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:24,880
iam

2764
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:25,760
or

2765
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:27,760
identity and access management then when

2766
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:30,400
it comes to exploiting active directory

2767
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,719
or windows ad

2768
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:34,800
you have no idea what's going on

2769
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:35,840
because

2770
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:38,159
like you have to learn like every time

2771
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:40,480
you try and exploit something it like

2772
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:43,599
it's a good way if you're curious it's a

2773
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:45,199
good way to

2774
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:47,280
start getting into it but like you don't

2775
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,040
know what you don't know which is part

2776
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,119
of why i gave this talk is like

2777
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:52,639
what like

2778
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:54,719
now you know you can be a tier one tier

2779
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:56,800
two tier three analyst you can

2780
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,719
work in a security operations center or

2781
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:01,440
network operations center you can do

2782
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,800
ot security you can do product security

2783
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,159
you can do

2784
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:07,840
um

2785
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:11,199
threat hunting you can do

2786
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:13,520
incident response you can do incident

2787
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,520
response you can be incident commander

2788
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,679
or incident response uh leader um

2789
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:21,440
i didn't mention the

2790
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,199
term some other uh

2791
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:26,800
terms which are cso or cio a chief

2792
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,239
information security officer or a chief

2793
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:31,920
information officer

2794
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,440
um

2795
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:34,960
but uh this

2796
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,679
i would say like knowing what

2797
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:39,679
exists like this isn't a comprehensive

2798
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:40,719
list

2799
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:42,480
right

2800
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:45,199
but this is cyberseek which is a good

2801
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:46,719
site for

2802
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:47,599
uh

2803
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:49,920
my sharing this correctly

2804
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,520
uh

2805
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:54,800
that has um all the different things

2806
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,480
here's a bunch of different names for

2807
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,440
roles

2808
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,760
so you can do

2809
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,679
you know they've arbitrarily defined

2810
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:03,840
some of these things like incident and

2811
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:05,440
intrusion analyst

2812
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:08,000
i would just call a security operations

2813
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,719
center analyst or a sock analyst

2814
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:12,880
they they

2815
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:14,800
they say cyber security analyst is

2816
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,719
different from that but

2817
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:17,520
um

2818
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:20,800
you know these are arbitrary separations

2819
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,400
um

2820
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,760
uh like

2821
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,920
like what is a specialist what is that

2822
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,440
what does that actually mean but these

2823
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,119
are all titles of roles you can be so

2824
01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:33,040
you can do it audit like uh and they'll

2825
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:36,080
they'll say like the type of things that

2826
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:37,760
are required

2827
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:38,840
or

2828
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:42,320
useful so um

2829
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,880
so they say you know top certifications

2830
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,040
requested that you can look into top

2831
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,920
skills requested so you know if you're

2832
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,960
uh doing it auditing um

2833
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:57,040
you know this is less uh

2834
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,880
this is more processed than it is like

2835
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,080
hacking right

2836
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,920
um

2837
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:04,880
cyber crime is one place to go um but if

2838
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,000
like if you start in software

2839
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,760
development they say

2840
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:10,719
you should go into an analyst or pen

2841
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:13,840
tester or an engineer or an architect

2842
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:16,400
but what is a cyber security engineer

2843
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,159
you know like are you working on

2844
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:20,000
applications are you doing application

2845
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,400
security are you doing cyber

2846
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:25,679
security operations engineering like and

2847
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:28,000
and soar work like working in security

2848
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,840
orchestration and writing writing

2849
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,440
programs so

2850
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,480
um

2851
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,360
like

2852
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:35,760
the this these are pretty good buckets

2853
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:38,000
and they'll tell you like what's uh

2854
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,440
what's useful like if you want to be a

2855
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,760
pen tester here's uh

2856
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,679
the breakdown

2857
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:45,840
um

2858
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:47,440
but uh

2859
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:50,320
like if you honestly don't know if you

2860
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,560
don't know what you want to do

2861
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,639
um

2862
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:57,040
you kind of just have to start somewhere

2863
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,119
and uh

2864
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:00,560
like some

2865
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,520
some people will say is like join the it

2866
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:07,440
team at a local company and do uh

2867
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:10,080
work at the help desk and then

2868
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,159
uh get certified and

2869
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:14,239
and then move move up the help desk or

2870
01:55:14,239 --> 01:55:15,920
move into the cyber security operations

2871
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:19,440
center like that's one option um but for

2872
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,760
but uh like

2873
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:23,360
you know like uh

2874
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:24,960
there's all kinds of

2875
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,800
you can get all kinds of certifications

2876
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,400
and get into whatever you actually want

2877
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,320
to do i mean some of it is a little

2878
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:31,599
expensive

2879
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:34,560
if you're not like like an organization

2880
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,719
will pay for your certifications

2881
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:39,440
um if you're already part of a part of

2882
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:40,800
it um

2883
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,080
in a lot of cases but if you you know if

2884
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,400
you're currently working um doing

2885
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:49,440
software engineering potentially

2886
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:51,040
unless you have like a good business

2887
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,199
case uh what like they're not gonna

2888
01:55:53,199 --> 01:55:54,960
necessarily cover trainings for you to

2889
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:57,280
become a network penetration tester

2890
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:58,080
like

2891
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,360
um

2892
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,520
you don't know like some some companies

2893
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,360
are really nice about it um

2894
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,400
um

2895
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,800
but for resources i mean i

2896
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,040
i have taught

2897
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,040
like i teach like middle and high school

2898
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:13,440
kids uh try and get them interested in

2899
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,880
technology and

2900
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,440
uh pen testing um

2901
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:19,119
but really it's just like everything

2902
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:20,800
that

2903
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,960
uh

2904
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:25,599
like it's just

2905
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:27,679
creating the mindset of like knowing how

2906
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:29,679
to approach these problems like

2907
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:31,679
everything is already on the internet

2908
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:34,000
right like there's plenty of resources

2909
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,520
for

2910
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,960
for things that exist already um so

2911
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,639
the

2912
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:42,960
like being able to

2913
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,080
like

2914
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,360
but uh like being able to you want to do

2915
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:48,239
a thing

2916
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:49,119
um

2917
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:52,320
being able to read the manual for

2918
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,639
the tools that the internet has pointed

2919
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:57,920
you to use um and like try and

2920
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:00,000
do this like that that's like why i

2921
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,440
think software engineering is a good

2922
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:03,040
place to start too is

2923
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:06,080
um is just like dealing with maybe

2924
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:08,960
frustration uh initially uh but just

2925
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:11,760
like having the having the uh

2926
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:14,400
the mindset of like i

2927
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,960
you can't know everything right

2928
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:19,360
with security especially you

2929
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,840
you can't protect against things that no

2930
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,560
one knows exists except

2931
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:27,199
except the bad guys right like but the

2932
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:30,000
principles of one thing are similar so

2933
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,679
maybe you start with pen testing on

2934
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:34,320
tryhackme.com like you try you learn

2935
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,840
linux uh and bash commands and you you

2936
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:40,239
learn powershell

2937
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:41,840
and

2938
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,719
you

2939
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:43,840
you know

2940
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:45,199
just get your hands on all these

2941
01:57:45,199 --> 01:57:46,239
projects

2942
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:48,480
um

2943
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:51,760
well anyway i don't

2944
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:54,880
there's a lot of stuff you can do um

2945
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:56,400
so it's it's really hard for me to say

2946
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,040
like one one place is the best you i i

2947
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,440
would recommend i mean you can look at

2948
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,920
my blog i have over 120 posts of just

2949
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:06,960
like how all the all the uh online

2950
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,639
challenges that i've done

2951
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:09,920
um

2952
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,159
is just like starting at like the linux

2953
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:15,280
stuff on over the wire and then like you

2954
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:17,040
know starting to do cyber security

2955
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:19,599
competition ctfs and like writing doing

2956
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:21,360
write-ups like if you actually have to

2957
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:23,440
explain something um

2958
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:25,280
it you know that that's a way to

2959
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,679
reinforce your knowledge like um you

2960
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:28,719
can't

2961
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:30,320
i mean i've seen some bad write-ups i

2962
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:31,679
guess uh

2963
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:33,440
where it's like i have no idea

2964
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:34,960
why this works but this is how it

2965
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,280
happened but like being able to

2966
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,280
like dig into why something happened and

2967
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:40,800
being curious about that stuff creating

2968
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,159
the mindset for

2969
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:43,119
you know

2970
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:44,320
like

2971
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,880
just uh being able to keep going and

2972
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:48,960
like and even to step away and then come

2973
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,280
back like um a lot of

2974
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:52,880
like i liked

2975
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,360
i mean i can keep talking forever um but

2976
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:56,159
uh

2977
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:58,480
the the um

2978
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:01,520
uh doing pen testing like you you work

2979
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:03,440
you might try and hack something hosted

2980
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,760
on a cms content management service like

2981
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:07,599
wordpress or

2982
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:08,560
um

2983
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,480
there's all kinds of like uh

2984
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,639
individually created ones that you can

2985
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:14,960
host as well that are open source or

2986
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,719
squarespace or whatever

2987
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:19,520
but the principles for hacking them are

2988
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,360
the same even if the systems are

2989
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:23,040
different

2990
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:27,280
and so you sort of get an image for

2991
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,679
how this might apply somewhere else

2992
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:31,280
maybe the terms are different in

2993
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:34,400
application security from you know

2994
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,280
a web you know

2995
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:38,960
group to group

2996
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,520
but the the principles of like

2997
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:44,080
access you know there's the cia triad

2998
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:46,639
like confidentiality integrity

2999
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:47,840
um

3000
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:49,599
what's the third one

3001
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:53,760
availability i mean um authentication uh

3002
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,560
like

3003
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:56,639
how what parts of these processes can

3004
01:59:56,639 --> 01:59:57,840
you actually

3005
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:59,599
intercept things like

3006
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:02,080
what are what are the ways

3007
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:07,639
like information moves so like

3008
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:18,400
sorry for the uh interruption

3009
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,800
uh we had uh

3010
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,480
the other machine guy but here here is

3011
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,840
we're back yeah uh

3012
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,639
so

3013
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:29,520
yeah so uh

3014
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:34,000
the thing is to be to be in security

3015
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,080
in my mind it's like it's about being

3016
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:38,400
curious and like

3017
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,760
people can do it just for work but like

3018
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:42,719
um

3019
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:45,040
you know

3020
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:46,400
i wouldn't like

3021
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:47,920
you know if you are interested like

3022
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,639
there's tons of tons of challenges to do

3023
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:53,360
um you just gotta find like what sort of

3024
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,360
thing you like doing like it's very okay

3025
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:57,599
if what you like doing this process

3026
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:00,560
like organizational

3027
02:01:00,719 --> 02:01:03,440
change management or something um

3028
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:05,599
a cyber security transformation like you

3029
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:07,199
can come out from a business angle you

3030
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:08,560
can come at it from

3031
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:10,000
you know um

3032
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,920
uh optimization or

3033
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:12,560
or

3034
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,360
or whatever but um it's really hard for

3035
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:18,080
me to say this is how you do

3036
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:20,000
uh to do it because

3037
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,480
security is so deep it's like so many

3038
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,960
things and it's like understanding them

3039
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:27,840
in depth so you can get focused on one

3040
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:31,840
point um but and like hacking is is sexy

3041
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:33,679
so that's why a lot of people like pen

3042
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:34,960
testing like

3043
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,440
why i started doing it probably is

3044
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:40,080
some form of that like breaking in um

3045
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:41,679
but

3046
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:43,679
the

3047
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:44,560
um

3048
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:47,840
but you know it's also like if you don't

3049
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,679
if you don't like having the i.t

3050
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:51,920
background and like actually building

3051
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:53,760
like a windows active record active

3052
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:56,159
directory environment in uh like in

3053
02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:57,679
virtual machines

3054
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:00,320
though that kind of vms like how how

3055
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,520
like

3056
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:03,840
like sniffing the packets seeing how

3057
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:06,400
these machines actually communicate and

3058
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:11,199
like understanding um you have like

3059
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:13,760
like like with some of those uh nested

3060
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,199
acronyms it's like okay i'm talking

3061
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:17,920
about one thing and then i and then then

3062
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:19,760
i bring up something else and then that

3063
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,119
reference is something else and then

3064
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:22,400
it's like all of a sudden you know it's

3065
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,320
like i'm talking about

3066
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,239
you know c-scaler when i was originally

3067
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:29,520
talking about you know um

3068
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,199
uh

3069
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:33,440
deep packet inspection or whatever it

3070
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:37,199
was but the the uh

3071
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:39,760
like

3072
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:42,639
i all i say is it's hard to rush it

3073
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:44,000
um

3074
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,400
but if you do like it

3075
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,639
you can get it right it's like it's all

3076
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:51,679
about if you if you put in the effort

3077
02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:54,480
um you can you can do any of these roles

3078
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:58,080
right yeah um the the

3079
02:02:58,080 --> 02:03:00,239
uh

3080
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:02,800
it it's just the biggest issue is not

3081
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,400
knowing what you don't know

3082
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,199
um

3083
02:03:05,199 --> 02:03:08,080
in my mind um and so that's the

3084
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:10,800
genesis of this talk

3085
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,840
is uh

3086
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:15,119
like like

3087
02:03:15,119 --> 02:03:17,599
even like you can a sock analyst maybe

3088
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:19,599
you don't want to be a level one stock

3089
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:22,159
analyst forever but like that's a great

3090
02:03:22,159 --> 02:03:24,400
way to start right

3091
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,560
help desk it's like you're dealing with

3092
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:29,119
physical systems many more hours a day

3093
02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:31,840
than you would otherwise like you can

3094
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,960
even myself who like i spent like

3095
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:38,000
years like doing these uh

3096
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,760
cyber challenges and writing all these

3097
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:42,800
blog posts um

3098
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:45,920
like uh it's hard to maintain a

3099
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:48,239
cadence of like of doing all these

3100
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:52,239
challenges while you have another job um

3101
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:53,920
but i mean like

3102
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:55,520
it's it's just a thing that you have to

3103
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:59,119
dedicate yourself to doing um the

3104
02:03:59,119 --> 02:03:59,920
like

3105
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:01,520
there's certifications that you can get

3106
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:03,040
like security plus

3107
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:06,159
or or even just study for it um that

3108
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:08,159
will cover like

3109
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:11,520
a lot of of this uh and like information

3110
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,599
about how we think about security

3111
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:17,119
and uh that's like the requirement to

3112
02:04:17,119 --> 02:04:19,280
get a job uh doing cyber for the

3113
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,880
government it's like having sex plus i

3114
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:24,159
believe it's the is is all you need like

3115
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:26,000
you don't have to have college education

3116
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,840
all you need is one certification um so

3117
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:30,639
uh

3118
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:31,920
that's

3119
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:33,840
uh

3120
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,760
that's one direction you can take if you

3121
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:38,159
actually know what you want to do

3122
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:40,480
there's more specific resources to pick

3123
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:43,040
for pen testing or for any of these

3124
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,719
things but um

3125
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:47,440
everything is connected and so you have

3126
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:49,840
to just

3127
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:52,239
just just pull the thread you know and

3128
02:04:52,239 --> 02:04:53,840
just keep uh just

3129
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,360
stay uh

3130
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:57,520
stay uh

3131
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,840
curious yep that's that's the way to do

3132
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:01,920
it any other questions from uh from you

3133
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:05,380
guys here in the uh in the room

3134
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:08,419
[Music]

3135
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:15,119
you know i actually did that already

3136
02:05:15,119 --> 02:05:17,199
all right uh but you know what it's

3137
02:05:17,199 --> 02:05:18,639
probably a good time to do it again

3138
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:20,960
because

3139
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,880
this presentation was a long long time

3140
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:25,599
ago and uh and it was also about

3141
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:28,079
great open open source oh no

3142
02:05:28,079 --> 02:05:30,639
one was what our secure operation center

3143
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:32,880
was and the other

3144
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:35,520
follow-up one was how to create your

3145
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:36,639
your

3146
02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:38,159
um you know

3147
02:05:38,159 --> 02:05:39,440
uh well

3148
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:41,440
what operation security operation center

3149
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:44,079
is all the infrastructure that requires

3150
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:46,560
and a lot of acronyms just like he show

3151
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:49,599
but then a follow-up uh presentation i

3152
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:50,800
did was

3153
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:52,880
how can you create your own operation a

3154
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,880
secure operation center using open

3155
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,960
source tools basically

3156
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:59,360
yeah so maybe uh i'll have to just have

3157
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:01,360
to update it because you know that was

3158
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:04,000
back in 2019

3159
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,480
probably and uh a lot of things have

3160
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:09,199
changed since then obviously

3161
02:06:09,199 --> 02:06:10,239
yeah

3162
02:06:10,239 --> 02:06:11,840
yeah so yeah

3163
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:14,880
um and anyone else in the other side of

3164
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:16,880
the world

3165
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:19,520
uh on the cybernet no

3166
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:21,840
uh i think uh

3167
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:25,119
