00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,960

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,840
the most affordable

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
uh possible uh other than that we'll

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
continue doing our meetings if you have

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200

75
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,599
basically trying to do the same thing

76

uh you know help people to get into

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,480

we try to place them into you know

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,120
workplaces get into the field uh but you

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,599
you know we need help and you know help

83

this activity

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,280
is to just get you started on this

132
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,960
capture the ether

133
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,840
game it's a uh it's a game where you

134
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,960
hack ethereum smart contracts i'll get

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,039
into what that is in a second but just

136
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,520
to be clear to start

137
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,840
um you're going to need a browser

138
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,880
extension called meta mask

139
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,759
so

140
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,600
metamask is a

141
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,840
it's a free add-on it acts as an

142
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
ethereum wallet um

143
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,880
you just sign up create an account

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,720
um say

145
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,360
firefox or chrome whatever you use um

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,880
and

147
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,400
you'll need that to participate today

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
so while i'm giving an introduction feel

149
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,600
free to

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
go and do that

151
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,120
um

152
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,400
the other thing we'll be using today we

153
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,479
might not have time to get to it but

154
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,320
i'll also mention it

155
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,759
is remix if you go to

156
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,759
remix.ethereum.org

157
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,919
post that in the chat maybe

158
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,400
um it's an ide

159
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,440
uh you can access it from your browser

160
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,720
and you'll be using this is what

161
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,400
you can use to write smart contracts

162
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,199
but anyway we'll get into that later

163
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,160
so

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,319
just through a bit of jargon out there

165
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,400
how many of you know what a smart

166
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,039
contract is in terms of

167
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,400
uh

168
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,479
the blockchain

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,759
bring up the chat

170
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,560
there is a question there for you on how

171
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,680
secure

172
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
is metamask oh yeah i can blow up the

173
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,880
resolution

174
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,199
um

175
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,240
so

176
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,560
metamask is

177
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
i mean it's

178
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,759
fairly secure it's uh

179
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,680
it

180
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,840
it's about as secure as you keep

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,759
your password to it it's not like a

182
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,520
hardware wallet

183
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,880
where

184
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,319
only you

185
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,120
have

186
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,520
access to it like

187
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,360
uh

188
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
you i believe you use your password to

189
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,120
get into your account and your comp your

190
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,840
account controls your uh

191
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,039
uh ethereum but other than that it's

192
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,479
it's uh

193
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,199
it's trusted it's used by people in the

194
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,800
company i just got an internship at uh

195
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,560
on chain

196
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,919
so

197
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,840
but we won't be using it to

198
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,520
we won't be working with actual theorem

199
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
we'll only be using test

200
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,199
ethereum today

201
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,560
so you don't have to

202
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,080
worry about using it for anything else

203
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,479
all right so

204
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,800
yeah if you have any more questions just

205
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,960
ask me post in the chat

206
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,240
so

207
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,199
a little bit of background

208
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,080
uh

209
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,039
it's a bit of a complicated technology

210
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,080
but

211
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,440
in the most basic sense smart contracts

212
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
are digital contracts stored on a

213
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,120
blockchain that are automatically

214
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,160
executed when certain conditions are met

215
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
um

216
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,599
and more specifically

217
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,560
take ethereum for example the ethereum

218
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,360
blockchain was built with

219
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,199
a new technology id in mind where

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,000
uh instead of just writing a transaction

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,840
to a block and then

222
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,280
writing that onto the blockchain you

223
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,759
could write code to a block

224
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,680
and then when that code is added to the

225
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
blockchain

226
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,760
all the nodes in the blockchain network

227
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,120
everyone in the

228
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,279
peer-to-peer system

229
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,120
working with the blockchain

230
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,799
executes that code on their own

231
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,880
computers and

232
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,519
changes the blockchain in some way

233
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,880
so for instance this could be used to

234
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
say i write a smart contract you can

235
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,120
think of it as a program really i write

236
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,360
a small contract that prints out the

237
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
words hello world

238
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,200
and i

239
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,519
then put that on a block the block gets

240
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,080
mined it gets put on the blockchain

241
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,240
and

242
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,160
now there's a message publicly on

243
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,600
blockchain that says hello world

244
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,800
that's a

245
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,320
that's a basic use of it it could

246
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,360
be used for many other things uh it

247
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,880
could release funds at a specific time

248
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,480
to specific people

249
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,440
you can use it to

250
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,800
register a vehicle send notifications

251
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
issue tickets

252
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
non-fungible tokens if you've heard of

253
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,519
them nfts those are written in smart

254
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,760
contracts

255
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,360
and the applications are just going to

256
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
get

257
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,519
more and more prominent

258
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,440
as this technology advances

259
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
um

260
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
so

261
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
does anyone have any questions about

262
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,279
smart contracts

263
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,800
how they work

264
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,480
it'll be a little conceptual first but

265
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,480
uh

266
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,760
well anyway um

267
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,959
going through this you may get a better

268
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,839
idea

269
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,360
um so

270
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,680
does everyone who wants to participate

271
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,120
have a bennett half metamask installed

272
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,000
um

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
on their browsers

274
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
i have a thumbs up in here

275
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,839
all right

276
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,320
okay if you're having any trouble just

277
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,560
let let me know um

278
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,720
so i'll just go ahead and get started

279
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,200
uh first thing you'll do

280
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,320
go ahead and go to

281
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,200
capturetheather.com

282
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,279
that's the uh

283
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
that's the game we're gonna play

284
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,200
and just

285
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,240
hit let's play

286
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,320
the way this works

287
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,120
the

288
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
warm-up challenge

289
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,480
has

290
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,079
basically has instructions to get

291
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,200
started

292
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
first is installing metamask which we

293
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,399
already did

294
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
and then we'll switch to the robston

295
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
test network

296
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,560
so by default we're on the main ethereum

297
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,160
test network that's where all the real

298
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,880
ethereum is it costs money to deploy

299
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,800
smart contracts there

300
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,000
we don't want to do that we want to

301
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,720
go to a test network so

302
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,560
um up here

303
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,959
there should be a little drop down menu

304
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,440
that says ethereum main net

305
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,959
if you go down

306
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,720
you may have to

307
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,279
show test networks

308
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,800
and go to the roxton test network max we

309
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
don't see what you're look what you're

310
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,639
pointing at oh is it

311
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,959
okay let me reshare my screen i bet it's

312
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,680
not

313
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,240
i bet it's only sharing the

314
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,079
browser not the pop-up

315
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,760
okay now when i click on

316
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
metamask can you see this now yes

317
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
all right great

318
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
um

319
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,800
so as i was saying in the top here

320
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,200
there's drop down menu

321
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,839
um

322
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,240
and if you click on it

323
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,079
and you click

324
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,040
uh show slid well

325
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,639
it's in the settings here if you click

326
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,720
show slash hi test networks you can go

327
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,160
to settings

328
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
turn it off or on

329
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,800
you want to turn it on

330
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
and then

331
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,639
then go back here switch the robston

332
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,560
test network

333
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,560
um

334
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,000
if you see here i currently have

335
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,639
around five ethereum and a test network

336
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,639
it's not real ethereum

337
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,399
um

338
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,200
so

339
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
if we're able to get there that's the

340
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,480
next step

341
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
um

342
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,800
next

343
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,959
next we're going to get some test ether

344
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,040
now the way you get test ethereum on a

345
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,200
test network is my connection good i'm

346
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,839
kind of

347
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,680
okay

348
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
um

349
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
the way you get tested theorem is

350
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,480
through a faucet metamask has a test

351
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,959
network faucet

352
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,000
but i'm going to be using

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,040
something a little different

354
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,399
okay

355
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
i kind of looked around for a faucet

356
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,079
that would actually give a good amount

357
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,000
of ethereum a good amount of time since

358
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,360
a lot of them

359
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,720
are kind of finicky and i found this one

360
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
it's

361
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,480
a

362
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,480
well it's a faucet it gives out 5

363
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,079
ethereum at a time to anyone with a

364
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,760
google sign on it

365
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,000
so

366
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
five ethereum is plenty

367
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,120
to do what we're doing that bigger

368
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,600
yeah sure

369
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,800
how's that

370
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,880
that's cool can you stick the um the

371
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,000
link in the chat just did

372
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,639
yes you did

373
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,800
yeah i uh shout out to the people at

374
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,839
portland state university

375
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:32,800
for

376
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,519
setting this up

377
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,399
so if you click here

378
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,760
you can sign in if you have a google

379
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,040
account just sign in

380
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,279
and uh

381
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,600
then to get your ethereum address click

382
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,920
on meta mask

383
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
um

384
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,279
and down here where it says account one

385
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,079
uh

386
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,000
your

387
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,079
your address is right below it you can

388
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,320
copy the clipboard

389
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,079
paste it here

390
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,320
and hit get ethereum

391
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,040
now i already got five ethereum

392
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,360
uh

393
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,519
i don't know if i'll give give me any

394
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,199
more but

395
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,599
we'll see

396
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,639
like i said five theorem is plenty i'm

397
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
just doing this as an example

398
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,160
it might take

399
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,279
like 30 seconds or so to

400
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,480
for the transaction to go through

401
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,399
in the meantime

402
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,240
it doesn't show anything

403
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,000
when you go to

404
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,800
when you go to this website

405
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,880
yeah the

406
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,839
this is the same screen that i got but

407
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,880
then if i click on metamask extension i

408
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,519
don't see it

409
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
oh got you um

410
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
oh maybe i need to refresh

411
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,440
the list

412
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
it'll take a it'll take a little while

413
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,959
for the ethereum to appear in your

414
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,800
account

415
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,680
so

416
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,600
we may have to wait here my theorem

417
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,320
hasn't arrived yet i already

418
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,839
this is from

419
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,920
previous amount

420
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,079
so

421
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,759
yeah just give it a few minutes

422
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,639
sam got his right away

423
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,240
ethereum i can transfer

424
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,360
a couple to you and

425
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
yeah we can we can share

426
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,279
can they use it to buy some pizza

427
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,440
unfortunately they don't they aren't

428
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,119
tied to real currency on the test

429
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,438
network

430
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,000
i mean

431
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,559
i broke my car moving on

432
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,720
it doesn't have market value

433
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,120
move

434
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,000
[Laughter]

435
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,240
uh to answer your question shannon i'm

436
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,360
not sure

437
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
i i know it works with firefox and

438
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,160
chrome it probably works with safari and

439
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,320
edge

440
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,280
i haven't tested that

441
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,480
the the only real requirement for

442
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,559
capture the ether is meta mask the other

443
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,840
stuff is optional

444
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,679
so you know some of you got you have

445
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,880
your e3

446
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,720
some of you already have your ether some

447
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
of you are still waiting

448
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,080
um

449
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,559
i'll just keep moving along and when you

450
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,600
get your ether you can

451
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
follow

452
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,000
basically

453
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,240
um

454
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
here it says to do it again because i've

455
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,679
already done it but

456
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,640
yields yours will probably say

457
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
you know start challenge

458
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,360
if you click on it

459
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
what will happen

460
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
conceptually is this code right here

461
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,000
this is solidity code

462
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,280
solidity is a smart contract language

463
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,120
um

464
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,000
and here of in solidity you can see a

465
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,160
smart contract is defined

466
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,679
in a programming sense for all the

467
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,799
programmers a spark contract is

468
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,280
comparable to a class in other

469
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,320
programming languages they can have

470
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,799
variables they can have functions

471
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,840
this one has a function

472
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,760
um and what we're doing right now

473
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,360
is we're really just

474
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,559
uh we're going to deploy this code

475
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,799
to the ethereum test net

476
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,160
uh by

477
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,960
hitting that button the start

478
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,840
challenge button

479
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,000
if everything worked well it should pop

480
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,120
up

481
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,400
with your meta mask extension

482
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,600
what just happened

483
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,919
are you guys seeing what's on my screen

484
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,960
yeah it's so horrible

485
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,840
uh

486
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,600
so this is what happens when you mess

487
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,679
with smart contracts

488
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,160
oh no

489
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,480
okay i i think it has something to do

490
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
with the sharing i have to re-share

491
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,039
but i need to

492
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,320
okay okay

493
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,919
there you are there you are okay is pink

494
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,160
give me a moment

495
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,039
okay

496
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,480
pink fuchsia same difference

497
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,559
let's try that again

498
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,720
i need to change my uh

499
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
distribution i realized i was on a

500
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,640
rolling distribution and not a

501
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,360
stable one

502
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,280
that's for another story

503
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,880
okay

504
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,760
so

505
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,360
like i was saying an extension should

506
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,799
pop up here

507
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,159
and

508
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,320
to perform any transaction on an

509
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,639
ethereum network it oh it did it again

510
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,919
what was that

511
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,120
is this a mac m4

512
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
uh

513
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,240
no i i'm on linux

514
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,799
are you running arch

515
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,880
no i'm

516
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,600
i'm running cali

517
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,760
well that's your problem

518
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,919
yeah

519
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,120
nothing ever works in college

520
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,720
yeah i've learned that the hard way

521
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,720
um

522
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,320
tell you what i will leave and come back

523
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,919
real quick

524
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,840
and

525
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
uh

526
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,240
be back soon

527
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,440
party break

528
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,760
you guys know where the restrooms are

529
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
right

530
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,559
there they're

531
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,799
that always

532
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,080
uh this recording goes on youtube

533
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,200
on youtube

534
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,440
on uh

535
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,600
do you get to see as we awkwardly wait

536
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,559
for max to come back

537
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,480
and fill our thumbs

538
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,790
not the same

539
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,829
[Music]

540
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,440
you know everybody is watching

541
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,480
the news uh it's a lot of information

542
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,200
flowing and i'll suggest you doing

543
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
there's all kinds of stuff going on uh

544
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
discussions meetings and i'm sure as

545
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,240
soon as the

546
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,400
the meetings adjourn

547
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,280
will be flooded with new intel uh it's

548
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,039
like seriously there's all kinds of

549
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,640
stuff going on right now

550
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,480
all right sorry for the weight everyone

551
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,720
uh

552
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,960
if you've been able to figure this out

553
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,000
on your own

554
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
uh

555
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
in the meantime

556
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,720
then good for you i'm gonna try i'm

557
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
gonna try again

558
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,000
okay

559
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,360
so

560
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,919
as i was saying every transaction on the

561
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,400
block on ethereum blockchain has a gas

562
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
fee that gas is paid to the miners to

563
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,280
incentivize them to mine your block

564
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
and put it on the blockchain

565
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,600
so it should be a small amount

566
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,159
relatively to what you have now

567
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,760
just go ahead and hit confirm

568
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,000
and

569
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,120
what will happen in a moment

570
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,919
usually take about 30 seconds

571
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,120
because the block has to be mined

572
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,120
before

573
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,320
the contract actually gets deployed

574
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,000
so

575
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,840
um to give some background

576
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,320
basically once this contract is on the

577
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,760
blockchain

578
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,400
it's it's compiled into

579
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,760
bytecode

580
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,960
all right so here transaction confirmed

581
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,760
it's on your metamask

582
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,919
transaction list now

583
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,159
and it says the contract is deployed at

584
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,440
this address

585
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,440
now you can actually click on this and

586
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,159
go look at it on ether scan

587
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,240
ether scan is a

588
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
it's an informational platform that can

589
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,440
give you information on

590
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,840
ethereum addresses ethereum contracts

591
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,240
all kinds of stuff

592
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,080
you know it'll show you the balance

593
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,760
that's in that address

594
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,799
here it knows there's a contract here

595
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,360
and as you can see actually

596
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,880
the contract has been written to the

597
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,440
blockchain in bytecode

598
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
uh

599
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,080
you know what you don't need to know

600
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,799
uh

601
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,840
what it is what pc do i have um

602
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,120
you'll have to be more specific i'm

603
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,840
currently running

604
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,720
kali linux

605
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
and i need to switch off of it since

606
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,039
it's not stable

607
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,309
[Music]

608
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,440
that was done

609
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,039
yeah i've been hearing about people shoe

610
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,480
bombing for years never seen it actually

611
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,400
out yeah do you know who it was casey

612
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,320
vicki rios

613
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
i should probably pick

614
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,639
john barber

615
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,279
well we can

616
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,600
do that

617
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,520
yeah that wasn't that bad not the worst

618
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,240
i've experienced

619
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,559
there

620
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,080
change the link maybe no

621
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,520
okay

622
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,840
anything else max

623
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
um

624
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,039
well

625
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,520
there was one more step and then you can

626
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,120
cut off you know try your own um

627
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,720
i'll i'll just finish it quickly because

628
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,960
this has been kind of rough um so

629
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,720
basically we've got the f we've got the

630
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,039
contract deployed at this address

631
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,159
and now

632
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,320
we can actually make another transaction

633
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,799
to call functions at this address that's

634
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,760
what we're going to do all we're going

635
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,200
to do is call

636
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,039
is complete

637
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,120
and it will return true and give us the

638
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,960
points

639
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,480
and

640
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
capture the user will do this for us we

641
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,960
hit check solution

642
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,559
it will ask us to perform another

643
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,279
transaction

644
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,240
so this time we are writing

645
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,760
a

646
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,559
function call to the blockchain instead

647
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,600
of a smart contract

648
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,000
so you do that

649
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,240
give it a few seconds

650
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,320
and we did it

651
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,799
problem solved

652
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,480
okay that's it that's my presentation

653
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,720
have fun feel free to play with it in

654
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,120
your own time

655
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,520
awesome

656
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,880
all right

657
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,960
let's see if i can

658
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,559
you should be able to share three thank

659
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,360
you max for that

660
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,240
i'll make your call right now

661
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,480
yeah

662
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,720
cool

663
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,840
handed it over to zach

664
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,240
all right

665
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,559
so

666
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,720
shall we play a game a hands-on

667
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,399
introduction to linux and powershell

668
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,799
let's

669
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,000
so if you're here

670
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,240
this isn't that necessary given

671
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,399
the sign right next to

672
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,000
right next to it but uh this is the

673
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,360
wi-fi if you haven't been on it already

674
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,799
i see your mouse

675
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,480
well

676
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,399
technical difficulties at a technical

677
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,279
meeting come on out

678
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,840
oh vicky the second is uh spamming can

679
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,800
you knock her out

680
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,919
[Music]

681
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,399
oh sorry my bad

682
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,960
so we're gonna be playing some war games

683
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,520
so what is a war game basically they're

684
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,000
fun little challenges to help you

685
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,840
practice security

686
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,399
and so they're similar to ctfs but

687
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,399
war games are usually focused on a

688
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,960
single topic and it's sort of like you

689
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,600
level up through them and you

690
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,520
it gets deeper and

691
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,480
on the same thing so uh today we're

692
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,679
doing a ctf this is a chimera because

693
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,039
we're doing a ctf comprised of war games

694
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,279
so

695
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,799
this ctf

696
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,760
is

697
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,360
if you're an absolute beginner and you

698
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,640
actually want to be

699
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,360
like read things and tell you how things

700
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,200
work you can go through linux journey

701
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,360
that is a part of the ctf so

702
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,200
you still can do it for the points

703
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,760
uh over the wire bandit which is linux

704
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,039
based puzzles also it's pitch to

705
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,760
absolute beginners but it's more of a

706
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,919
trial by fire because

707
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,480
you uh

708
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,760
like you kind of have to look stuff up

709
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
for yourself so they'll give you some

710
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,399
hints of commands to look up but

711
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,919
uh

712
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,960
definitely

713
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,640
google

714
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,919
think about like what you're actually

715
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,840
trying to do and then ask

716
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,240
like what you're what uh how to do it

717
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,039
and under the wire century is similar to

718
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,039
bandit but with powershell commands

719
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,240
so

720
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,399
you can start now this is the link

721
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,640
i'm going to be going through sort of if

722
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,720
you're a beginner i'm going to talk

723
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,279
about how to approach some of these

724
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,240
challenges

725
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,320
but if you just want to

726
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,919
get ahead and

727
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,240
start competing there's the link i

728
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,919
believe it's also posted

729
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,679
on the zoom

730
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,000
or uh in the meetup

731
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,760
oh yeah let me put that link

732
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,000
here in the chat

733
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,599
[Music]

734
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,360
all right so

735
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,320
that's it right now

736
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,159
so we're going to start with a bandit

737
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,760
just because that's the uh

738
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,440
what i'm doing so the first uh the first

739
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
thing you gotta know if you're if you're

740
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,480
a newbie is the man man the manual

741
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,159
read the manual so if you don't know

742
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,399
what a command does there's a list in

743
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,120
bandit of the things uh the commands

744
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,200
that might be relevant to the challenge

745
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,240
um just run man before it and it'll tell

746
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,399
you what to do so

747
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,840
we're going to start at bandit level 0

748
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,880
and uh sort of once we're part of the

749
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,519
way through this

750
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,279
we're gonna ask people to come up and

751
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,720
talk about some of their own uh

752
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,880
solutions because there's many different

753
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
ways to solve these different things so

754
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,320
if you come up with a creative way we

755
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,919
can sort of play uh

756
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,360
bash golf

757
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,480
or

758
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,120
any of these things trying to

759
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,240
just if you come up with something

760
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,840
interesting don't don't hesitate to

761
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,919
share it so um

762
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,279
just starting off

763
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,360
we're gonna start as basic as possible

764
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,799
ssh you need to connect to this server

765
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:39,760
so

766
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,039
the ssh information

767
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,240
is

768
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,960
the host is bandit.labs.overviewer.org

769
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,559
and port

770
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,480
2220 so ssh

771
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,640
ssh uses

772
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,320
the open ssh ssh client

773
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,159
and it's a program for logging into a

774
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,320
remote machine and for example executing

775
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,559
commands on a remote machine you don't

776
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,360
see

777
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,440
anything visually there's no gui or

778
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,079
graphical unit user interface it's just

779
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,520
uh

780
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,040
just the command line

781
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
so uh

782
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,199
how you actually connect is you have to

783
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,839
specify the

784
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:20,879
host

785
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,918
the port if it's not port 22 22 is

786
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,719
default this is 2-2-2-0

787
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,679
and then um

788
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,720
and then the password but

789
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,480
so here's all the different things you

790
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,159
can actually choose

791
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,239
in ssh there's a lot of different

792
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,320
options you can read through the manual

793
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,839
on your own if you really want to dig

794
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,119
deep into it but what i recommend

795
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,960
is for these challenges

796
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
as you level up

797
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,719
and you get to

798
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,440
as you you go from user band at zero to

799
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,359
bandit one to bandit two

800
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,320
uh

801
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,119
this is the way that i found the easiest

802
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,280
because you specify

803
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
the host

804
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,720
the port and then dash l is the user uh

805
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,560
but because you're going to be exiting

806
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
and then logging in to the next user

807
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,400
each time uh

808
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,320
if you press up on the

809
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,560
command line it'll just auto kill what

810
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,320
you already have you can just press

811
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,640
delete and press bandit one bandit two

812
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
banner three instead of

813
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,280
otherwise you would do ssh bandit one at

814
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,440
bandit that labs and so you would have

815
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,480
to go all the way to the beginning of

816
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
the frame so this is just

817
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,839
the easiest way

818
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,640
in my mind of doing it

819
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,520
so um

820
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,880
next thing

821
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,760
this is oh

822
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,960
am i not sharing that

823
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,599
so this is the

824
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,040
uh actual site that the ctf is being

825
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,440
hosted on which the link is posted in

826
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,720
the meetup and in zoom

827
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,959
so

828
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,000
so these are the different challenges so

829
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,240
this is linux journey if you want the

830
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,960
basics uh explained to you like you can

831
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,640
do getting started it'll tell you all

832
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,720
these different things that is possible

833
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,320
on linux

834
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,560
and you can

835
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,200
just go through the

836
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,440
the challenge is here

837
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,680
and it'll give you a lot of uh

838
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,720
explanation um as you go

839
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,279
the uh

840
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,960
the other way

841
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,800
the the other place you could start if

842
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,119
you're starting on if you're doing linux

843
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,920
is

844
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,359
bandit

845
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,680
uh

846
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,440
i guess

847
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,000
this is not it's the same

848
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,200
question

849
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,160
yeah so

850
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,640
here's like as i was saying here are the

851
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,160
uh the commands that you may need to

852
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,599
solve this question so if you do want to

853
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,200
um

854
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,280
look it up

855
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,599
uh you can in your terminal just go

856
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,920
uh so ls was one of those commands

857
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,280
you can run man

858
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,119
manual ls

859
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,200
maybe

860
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,760
uh and it will give you

861
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,079
all the information about this command

862
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,920
um

863
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,000
so this is for listing directory

864
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,560
contents which is probably

865
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,320
the most basic thing that you you would

866
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,079
do in linux it's basically just opening

867
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,400
up your file explorer and seeing what

868
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,920
files are in

869
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,440
a directory

870
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,680
so um

871
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,400
i'll uh let you all uh

872
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
get after it but here is the

873
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,800
here is the site for uh to start and how

874
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,079
you submit

875
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,040
once you find the answer to a level uh

876
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,240
you can enter the flags here

877
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,880
you can say which which uh series you're

878
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,000
doing b for bandit lj for linux journey

879
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,800
uh u for under the wire

880
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,040
uh which i'll get to in just a second

881
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,200
and you can say which challenge it was

882
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,760
you can submit your name and the flag

883
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,480
and so uh

884
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,320
we can see over time

885
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,280
at the scoreboard

886
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,599
um

887
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,599
this will be populated once people start

888
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,599
actually submitting flags yeah and by

889
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,440
the way heads off to sam

890
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,359
for getting that set up for us

891
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,279
[Applause]

892
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,359
and uh

893
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,560
you know

894
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,119
i think it's the tv

895
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,079
setting um so

896
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,440
yeah but i'll let people get started

897
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,200
so if you're going to start with the

898
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,800
powershell

899
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,800
um

900
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,960
[Music]

901
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,520
so they uh they tell you to join the

902
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,119
slack but

903
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,280
you don't actually need to do that

904
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,520
uh

905
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,240
the the first user is century one and

906
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,920
the first password is century one i

907
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,880
believe

908
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,760
uh

909
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,280
so if you get to that or if you're doing

910
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,200
that first

911
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,440
this will instead of connecting you to a

912
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,000
linux box it's gonna connect you to a

913
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,359
windows machine

914
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,079
where you can use powershell commands

915
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,960
so uh

916
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,040
i believe uh

917
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,880
i'll let you all uh get started and i'll

918
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,760
put up the link again

919
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,440

if you want to show off um one of your

926
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,800
solutions uh maybe

927
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,200
depending how competitive you are uh

928
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,119
maybe you'll wait till uh towards the

929
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,800
end but uh

930
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,960
we're gonna talk about uh different ways

931
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,720
of solving um

932
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,879
the bandit and uh under the wire

933
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,280
and how do i make this thing uh refresh

934
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,079
oh

935
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,599
it's in there special storyboards

936
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,280
refresh

937
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,319
and uh summary

938
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,880
thank you

939
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,078
okay

940
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,599
if you need something let me know

941
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,160
so you're actually connecting into

942
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,400
a server so

943
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,079
so no

944
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,760
so you you can connect to it from

945
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,480
windows from anything

946
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,000
yeah and if you on a mac

947
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,480
yeah i mean once you ssh in you're just

948
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,079
going to be in the linux environment

949
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:34,960
okay

950
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,720
so that's why i think this is a good

951
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,420
place to start

952
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,200
[Music]

953
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,400

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,760
yeah

955
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,000
yeah so it's better to use

956
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,880
well

957
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,720
i mean it's

958
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,959
it's going to be the same no matter what

959
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,480
like um i mean

960
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,400
all right do you have math

961
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,440
yeah you'll be found on the mac yes

962
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,040
like ssh you'll have

963
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,230
[Music]

964
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,880

oh yeah

969
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,440
like if you like ssh in your windows

970
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,960
environment

971
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,440
will no longer be using your linux or

972
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,880
unity

973
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,119
as well

974
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,359

[Music]

1037
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,720
so this is from a windows command line

1038
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,040
now

1039
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:34,400
[Music]

1040
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:47,819
[Music]

1041
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,640
the same things

1042
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:58,859
[Music]

1043
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,280
i mean like like when you're connected

1044
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,440
to this computer you're only connected

1045
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,559
in this browser

1046
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,440
yeah

1047
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,559
so i mean i can curl i don't know

1048
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,520
pearl

1049
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,340
google

00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,399
[Music]

1051
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:41,320
[Music]

1052
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:44,960
so

1053
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,440
if you this is this is an interactive

1054
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,559
chart

1055
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,720
right

1056
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:59,069
[Music]

1057
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,780
uh

1058
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:09,500
[Music]

1059
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:16,249
[Music]

1060
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,949

1061
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:50,468

1062
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,849
[Music]

1063
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,939
[Music]

1064
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,880
and just be like so how does it work if

1065
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,319
i want to

1066
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,240
combine

1067
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:45,129
[Music]

1068
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,480
there's an error you can't add

1069
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,559
so it's not just you know text to a

1070
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,839
number that's what this says

1071
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,559
yeah so so i'm like oh yeah right so i

1072
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,240
can convert it

1073
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,680
string

1074
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,558
plus a

1075
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:18,080
[Music]

1076
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,780
[Music]

1077
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,520
somewhere else i might even just open up

1078
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,359
a little python test

1079
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,799
so i'm trying to do something together

1080
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,199
[Music]

1081
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,280

1082
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,570
[Music]

1083
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,260
[Music]

1084
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,440
someone typed out

1085
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:34,260
[Music]

1086
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,599
i mean

1087
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,880
[Music]

1088
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,880

[Music]

1091
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,880
this is pretty high level right because

1092
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,119
there's building blocks essentially so

1093
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,799
this is

1094
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,680
just some event happening

1095
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,399
are there any results

1096
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:32,559
yeah

1097
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,799

um

1108
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,880

okay

1113
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,640
but like if the decision was made to use

1114
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:59,009
[Music]

1115
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,960

[Music]

1136
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,319
did you get a job oh yeah yeah that's

1137
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,850
good that's the whole point right

1138
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,759
[Music]

1139
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,319
sounds like a success

1140
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,439
hey zach i was actually able to solve

1141
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,238
uh

1142
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:31,679
b5

1143
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,920
or actually i think it was b6 i was

1144
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,600
having trouble on

1145
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,600
oh

1146
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,799
bingo

1147
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:45,040
yeah

1148
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,719
actually b7 was fun i just came up with

1149
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:52,439
a command for it

1150
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,430
really

1151
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:03,479
[Music]

1152
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,659
[Music]

1153
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,600
for some reason it's so much harder for

1154
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,600
me

1155
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:26,199
the documentation isn't as well written

1156
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:35,290
[Music]

1157
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,198
i don't know about this

1158
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,040
competition site but all the individual

1159
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,600
sites will be

1160
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,880
how long will the

1161
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,899
ctf site

1162
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:53,600
[Music]

1163
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,400
so this portion

1164
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,700
um

1165
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,800
[Music]

1166
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,880
no i mean there's a scoreboard on the

1167
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,120
site but

1168
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,800
i'm probably gonna do

1169
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,560
like a walkthrough

1170
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,560
at some point and ask people to come up

1171
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,360
and

1172
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:20,320
say how they solved it

1173
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,480
i don't know i guess it's 220. so um

1174
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,880
you think uh we should start going

1175
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,040
through some solutions sure um however

1176
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,040
you prefer uh we have

1177
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,040
well we've worked on so far but you know

1178
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,040
we

1179
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,480
whatever whatever you guys started

1180
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,520
okay

1181
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,719
well

1182
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,560
maybe i'll go through some of bandit

1183
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,280
okay get some people uh if some people

1184
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,640
have been stuck

1185
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,640
uh get them

1186
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,159
a little forward and then um

1187
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,640
okay

1188
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:03,470
[Music]

1189
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,360
so for uh

1190
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,840
linux or really any of these things

1191
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,280
you don't know what you don't know and

1192
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,719
that's what

1193
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,360
like i think is so great about bandit is

1194
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,120
it really lets you find out what you

1195
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,080
don't know

1196
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,320
and uh points you in the right direction

1197
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,719
to learn it so i'm going to

1198
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,400
i guess i'll just start at the the

1199
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:49,719
beginning and share my screen here

1200
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,920
cut off

1201
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,199
[Music]

1202
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,320
okay so uh actually let me just start

1203
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,480
very beginning

1204
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,239
so

1205
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:18,040
first log in

1206
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,480
so here's the command i was using

1207
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,360
and

1208
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,920
i'm just

1209
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,719
it's not

1210
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,159
whatever

1211
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,320
keep it big

1212
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,239
okay so uh

1213
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,920
login

1214
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,640
and zero the password

1215
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,000
and

1216
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,400
uh the password so b1 it says the

1217
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,000
password for the next question is stored

1218
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,840
in a file called readme located in the

1219
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,320
home directory

1220
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,950
so um just like in

1221
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:07,120
[Music]

1222
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,320
let's see

1223
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,520
i don't know what kind of information

1224
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,880
i'm going to be giving away by sharing

1225
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,199
my desktop um

1226
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,080
but uh the

1227
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,199
so ls

1228
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,040
which is one of the commands that they

1229
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,440
say useful uh is basically like opening

1230
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,719
up a directory so instead of

1231
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:28,480
um

1232
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,120
instead of uh

1233
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,880
like visually seeing this what you can

1234
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,080
do

1235
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,280
is you can say ls or list

1236
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,520
actually what is

1237
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,920
it say list directory contents

1238
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,960
so i ran manual so this is this is

1239
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,560
explicitly what ls stands for list

1240
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,280
directory content so you can just open

1241
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,960
the folder you're in which is actually

1242
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,400
where readme is

1243
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,640
or you can specify

1244
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,280
wherever you want to open so anywhere on

1245
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,560
the computer so linux the root directory

1246
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,560
is slash so this is

1247
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,159
basically

1248
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:07,840
everything in the computer

1249
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,440
is stored here

1250
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,360
so

1251
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,560
uh there's a few other commands cd

1252
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,719
change directory

1253
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:17,920
so if you wanted to change your

1254
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,400
directory

1255
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,000
maybe i'm getting into the weeds here

1256
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,679
but uh

1257
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:25,360
ls-a

1258
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,159
we check man

1259
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,360
dash a

1260
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,880
is all

1261
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,719
do not ignore entries starting with

1262
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,400
period so

1263
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,600
in

1264
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,640
in

1265
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,159
linux and

1266
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,320
other operating systems when you want to

1267
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,640
hide a file from normal viewing you put

1268
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,480
a period in front of the name

1269
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,920
and that is

1270
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,120
um

1271
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,360
a lot of times because you don't really

1272
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,040
need to see

1273
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,400
like

1274
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,360
every every configuration file

1275
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,719
that you have

1276
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:57,440
so

1277
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,679
you can see here these

1278
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,440
maybe you can see it's pretty small some

1279
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,000
of these folders are

1280
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,239
highlighted or different color than the

1281
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:08,560
others because some of them are hidden

1282
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,920
like this re agent intel program data

1283
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,239
uh that i don't really need to know

1284
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:14,960
but

1285
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,480
because

1286
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:16,770
i'm

1287
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:18,800
[Music]

1288
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,880
because i feel like it you can you can

1289
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,600
set it the properties to show

1290
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,520
to show hidden files so anyway

1291
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:31,199
so if we do ls-a on this linux machine

1292
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,760
we actually see

1293
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,199
a period

1294
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,880
which actually

1295
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,679
means this directory

1296
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,640
period period which is basically

1297
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,000
pointing

1298
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,480
to the directory above it the parent

1299
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,600
directory

1300
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,199
and then here are a bunch of hidden

1301
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:52,799
files dot bash log

1302
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,199
rc.profile so these are

1303
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,040
things that are run

1304
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,040
when you open

1305
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,000
a uh

1306
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:05,120
when you open a

1307
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,239
terminal window so these things get run

1308
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,560
you can check those out with the cat

1309
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,660
command

1310
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:13,520
[Music]

1311
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,440
concatenate files and print on the

1312
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,760
standard and output so the standard

1313
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,880
output is what gets printed to

1314
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,760
the screen to the to the terminal so if

1315
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,880
i cat

1316
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,360
dot batch rc this will be a lot of stuff

1317
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,080
that won't matter to you but you can see

1318
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,480
all these things are run when you open

1319
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:36,800
when you connect and and open it so um

1320
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
certain things like the color

1321
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,199
like you can see that this is green this

1322
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:42,400
is blue

1323
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,040
uh that's all decided by variables

1324
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,199
within within dash rc

1325
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,920
so um to actually get to the

1326
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,840
the challenge

1327
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,600
we can use cat

1328
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,280
to print a file to standard output

1329
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,360
um before you do that though you might

1330
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,520
want to check what type of file is this

1331
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,199
with the file command

1332
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:06,320
and it says it's ascii text so it's just

1333
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,450
it's just text

1334
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:09,360
[Music]

1335
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,159
and

1336
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,719
there it is so here is the password to

1337
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,040
the next level

1338
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,280
so uh feel free to run man on any of

1339
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,199
these commands and just

1340
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,560
spend some time figuring out what they

1341
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,640
do

1342
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,120
but uh to get to the next level

1343
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,159
you can connect internally but i just

1344
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:31,120
exit

1345
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,640
because i have this command here if you

1346
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,800
press up it'll auto fill the previous

1347
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,679
thing

1348
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,920
another fun thing is the history command

1349
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,679
you can see all the commands that you've

1350
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,840
run

1351
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,520
in since you've cleared that and uh

1352
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,360
you can actually

1353
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,080
do exclamation point 2004

1354
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,000
that's the number that this command was

1355
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,040
run

1356
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,199
and it'll actually run that command

1357
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:58,159
again that was a fun thing that took i

1358
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,080
didn't know about for a long time so i

1359
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,159
figured i'd share that uh

1360
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,679
but we're actually trying to go to

1361
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,159
bandit one

1362
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,600
so

1363
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,920
and now we have to do the password so i

1364
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,440
grabbed the password from the previous

1365
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,320
one saved it to my clipboard

1366
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,280
and

1367
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,560
thank god so i don't have to do that

1368
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,560
again uh

1369
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,719
and so now we're in bandit one so this

1370
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,880
basically just means we are

1371
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,400
another user on this computer bandit

1372
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:31,280
and if you if you run ls um like i said

1373
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,080
uh

1374
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,360
here's a

1375
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,520
a period and here's period period if you

1376
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,320
run ls on period that's saying

1377
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,560
ls on this folder

1378
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,840
so if

1379
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,640
so um

1380
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,600
that's basically default um but if you

1381
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,360
do ls.dot

1382
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,199
you're going to

1383
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:53,520
print out the list of all of the

1384
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,000
directories above

1385
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,240
above this one and on linux

1386
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,480
[Music]

1387
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,120
this command is going up two levels you

1388
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,360
do dot dot slash dot dot

1389
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,239
um

1390
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:10,559
you can see uh

1391
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,880
like where this stuff is actually

1392
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,760
located so well if you do pwd actually

1393
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,840
it'll tell you specifically you are in

1394
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,480
slash home slash bandit one

1395
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,600
and in home so if i change directory

1396
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,040
into home

1397
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,239
to ls this is all of the users on this

1398
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:29,600
machine

1399
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,320
that

1400
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,320
are like our normal users there are

1401
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,920
plenty of other um like daemons that

1402
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,440
like

1403
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,960
are doing things in the background but

1404
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,320
these are all individual users that have

1405
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,440
an account

1406
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,920
so um if we wanna

1407
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,280
so we have to go to bandit one

1408
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,800
that's where we are and you can see this

1409
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,679
little uh tilde is basically short for

1410
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,520
your home directory

1411
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,560
so

1412
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,520
your bandit one so your home directory

1413
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,719
is slash home slash bandit one so if you

1414
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,800
do ls

1415
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,040
nothing ls dot ls slash home slash

1416
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,120
bandit one

1417
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,760
uh ls slash

1418
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,159
tilde you're all going to get the same

1419
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,560
response because all those things mean

1420
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,840
the same thing or at least they're

1421
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,719
pointing to the same thing

1422
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,679
so um like if you're off in the root

1423
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,560
directory and you're messing around and

1424
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,000
you know doing whatever you can just cd

1425
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,080
back into your home directory

1426
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,120
and that's

1427
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,880
that's like this the easiest way to do

1428
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,239
that is with the tilde um

1429
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:43,520
but

1430
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,840
so why am i why am i going with all this

1431
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:46,880
well

1432
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,400
the password to the next question is

1433
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,040
stored in a file called dash located in

1434
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,800
the home directory

1435
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,840
so

1436
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,840
we can see it here

1437
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,239
right like

1438
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,040
uh we can see the dash right here

1439
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:03,920
but

1440
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,080
if we try to run the command cat dash

1441
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,120
we're

1442
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,520
put into the next line and what happened

1443
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,679
uh if i type something you know test

1444
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:18,880
it'll repeat it so this is actually

1445
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,239
and then i'm going to press ctrl c to

1446
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:23,440
um

1447
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,638
exit that little

1448
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:29,040
interactive

1449
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,080
cat command uh if you check the manual

1450
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,360
for cat

1451
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,800
you'll see that

1452
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,080
with no file or when file is dashed read

1453
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,679
the standard input

1454
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:42,159
and so this prints to standard output

1455
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:43,920
what is put into it

1456
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,159
so when i do cat

1457
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:47,840
when i run cat

1458
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,280
it's actually just going to print out

1459
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,880
exactly what i type it so this isn't

1460
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,080
that useful in and of itself

1461
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,679
you know i can have a conversation with

1462
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:59,199
myself but uh

1463
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,120
but it's useful when chaining together

1464
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,800
different things and different contexts

1465
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,840
so if i actually want to

1466
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,639
find dash if i want to actually access

1467
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:11,120
dash i have to be more specific

1468
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,280
so

1469
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,120
because of

1470
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,199
how cat works and

1471
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,199
and also like you could find other

1472
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,040
commands to print this out

1473
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,960
um but like less

1474
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,440
but that has its own problem because it

1475
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,680
has its own functionality with dash

1476
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,920
[Music]

1477
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,760
and does anyone know how to exit left

1478
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:47,450
[Music]

1479
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,719
well i busted it

1480
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:58,159
[Music]

1481
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,239
yeah i think it's because i did dash so

1482
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:02,250
this is this

1483
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:05,040
[Music]

1484
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,960
have you tried is it off and on again

1485
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,320
yeah so maybe i'll just do that

1486
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,600
yeah

1487
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,320
i'm just uh

1488
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:33,600
so here we are in bandit 2 and

1489
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,960
actually i'm gonna go

1490
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,000
zero

1491
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:43,360
[Music]

1492
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,880
this is this is why it's good to write

1493
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,320
this stuff down uh cat read readme

1494
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,239
grab that

1495
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,280
uh exit

1496
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,599
one

1497
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,719
paste it

1498
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,320
and now we're back here

1499
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,320
so and i've been using the clear command

1500
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,199
to clear the the screen it still exists

1501
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:08,239
if you scroll up but um it's just for

1502
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:09,840
presentation why i'm doing that to make

1503
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,520
it easier to read

1504
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,760
so um ls

1505
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,440
uh we have this dash

1506
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,199
so i i did

1507
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:20,080
talk about um a lot of different ways to

1508
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,560
access

1509
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,800
the to talk about a location on the

1510
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,960
machine so we're in uh we're in

1511
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,880
right um

1512
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,159
if we print

1513
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,000
i'll just show the man page for that

1514
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,400
print name of current working directory

1515
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,520
print the full name of the current

1516
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,320
working directory we're going to

1517
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,120
um we're going to see that it's

1518
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,880
home bandit one um and it's also tilde

1519
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,719
so where this actual file is right we

1520
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,520
know it's within this folder

1521
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,639
uh we know explicitly

1522
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,360
the location uh so what we could do is

1523
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,280
we could do cat

1524
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,320
um

1525
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,360
dot slash dash

1526
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,880
and that'll actually work because we're

1527
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,480
specifying it's not dash as a special

1528
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,800
character it's like

1529
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,400
an actual like

1530
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,880
file name located in this folder so you

1531
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,040
can do all those other things as well

1532
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:22,800
you can do cat tilde slash dash

1533
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,560
you can do cat

1534
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,400
slash home

1535
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,120
slash bandit one

1536
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,040
slash dash

1537
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:35,199
may even be able to specify it in quotes

1538
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:36,860
no you can't do that

1539
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,120
[Music]

1540
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,440
but uh there's so if anyone has another

1541
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,040
way of doing that and wants to share

1542
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,159
feel free

1543
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:45,199
but uh

1544
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:47,040
that's this is

1545
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,560
there's like a lot of things that are

1546
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,280
like

1547
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,520
tangential that you kind of just

1548
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,040
learn as you try and solve this problem

1549
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:56,080
like you could just google

1550
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,080
how to open

1551
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:02,239
a file with a dash file name

1552
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:03,120
right

1553
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,000
and

1554
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,840
stack overflow tells you

1555
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:10,480
um i tried get it nano v leafpad and

1556
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,719
other text editors it won't open

1557
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,400
um

1558
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,638
so

1559
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,840
using dash as an argument

1560
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,560
usually refers to standard in and out

1561
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,040
which is standard out is printing to the

1562
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,880
the screen so

1563
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,400
if you want to open this type of file

1564
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,159
you have to specify the full location of

1565
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:32,400
the file

1566
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,920
so that's what

1567
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,679
that's what uh

1568
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:37,280
i've been doing

1569
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,120
so um

1570
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,400
and you know you wouldn't have known

1571
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,719
that about cat unless you how it worked

1572
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,000
unless you checked the man page you

1573
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,199
won't know about these things unless you

1574
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:47,280
look them up and so this is kind of just

1575
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,360
um a way of even there's a helpful

1576
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,560
reading materials about special

1577
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,440
characters and dashboard names there

1578
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,960
so um

1579
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,520
we have the password

1580
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,440
um

1581
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,159
now yeah the dash change the

1582
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,719
characteristics of the file

1583
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:08,560
usually with any cat it will print out

1584
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,400
the content of file yeah right so the

1585
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,840
dash is changing

1586
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,920
the characteristic so it's not changing

1587
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,600
the characteristic of the file it's a

1588
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,400
characteristic of the cap command itself

1589
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,760
if you remember

1590
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,800
in cat

1591
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,920
when it

1592
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,639
when file is dash it has different

1593
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,560
behavior

1594
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,239
so that's just like

1595
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:30,840
someone read this and was like oh

1596
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,400
um

1597
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,120
i'll write a challenge about that

1598
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,320
so um

1599
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,519
now on to bandit two

1600
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,480
uh

1601
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,159
there's

1602
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,760
a lot of stuff installed that you really

1603
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,679
don't need uh for any of these

1604
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:50,400
challenges so

1605
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,400
remember that take that as you may so

1606
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,840
the the passwords the next question is

1607
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,600
stored in a file called spaces in this

1608
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,920
file name located in the home directory

1609
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,679
so in our home directory

1610
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:02,560
this looks like four separate files from

1611
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,560
what we've seen before right

1612
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,440
um

1613
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,960
and so if i try to do cat spaces in this

1614
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,120
file name

1615
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,760
uh it's trying to actually open five

1616
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,520
separate files because that's how cat

1617
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,320
works if you can open multiple files if

1618
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,159
you do ls-a

1619
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:24,320
you know i can do cat dot dash logout

1620
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,080
dot dash

1621
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,520
rc and it will concatenate it'll print

1622
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,520
both of those things in a row

1623
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,440
so that's that's the the behavior we're

1624
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,280
trying to avoid so how do you actually

1625
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,639
open this file

1626
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:37,840
um

1627
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,520
there's there's a couple things to know

1628
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,480
so

1629
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,520
you can

1630
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,480
do what's called escape a character so

1631
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,880
normally it's going to read a space as a

1632
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,520
as a separation between file names but

1633
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,480
if you

1634
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,120
use a backslash and then a space you're

1635
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,159
telling it interpret this next character

1636
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:57,120
as

1637
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:57,470
um

1638
01:28:57,470 --> 01:29:00,560
[Music]

1639
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,360
as text you're you're escaping it that's

1640
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,199
what it's called

1641
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:06,560
yeah yeah

1642
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,840
human language so uh

1643
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,280
in this

1644
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,840
and i might have done the wrong slashes

1645
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,000
but there we go so that works

1646
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,600
the other thing you can do

1647
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,920
is actually

1648
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,960
put a plot around it

1649
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:24,480
[Music]

1650
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,480
and that will also work

1651
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,440
um

1652
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,560
and

1653
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,840
if you just do

1654
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,159
s and then hit tab it will actually

1655
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,239
auto-complete

1656
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,000
if there's only one file in that folder

1657
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,840
starting with s it'll auto complete it

1658
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,520
for you so you don't even have to

1659
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,840
write it

1660
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:45,120
also if you do that with uh

1661
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,470
within the quotes that'll also work

1662
01:29:47,470 --> 01:29:49,360
[Music]

1663
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,440
but if you only do spaces and then slash

1664
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,440
and then tab it won't

1665
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:54,560
won't do it

1666
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,800
sorry

1667
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,679
i just think if you do spaces

1668
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,440
slash tab

1669
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,440
will it actually fill out all the rest

1670
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:04,159
uh

1671
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:08,639
spaces slash tab will work

1672
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:09,840
but if you do

1673
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,120
like

1674
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,880
if you're misinterpreting it and you do

1675
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,080
spaces

1676
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,719
slash space

1677
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,960
it'll actually fix it for you

1678
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,480
but um

1679
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,440
like it won't work if you do

1680
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,800
[Music]

1681
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,400
if you're escaping it

1682
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,080
while also

1683
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:31,080
uh

1684
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,719
because there's no such file that exists

1685
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:40,639
i could make that file but

1686
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:41,520
um

1687
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,920
if it's also the only file in the

1688
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:46,080
directory you can do sp and then

1689
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,320
asterisk

1690
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,159
that's true

1691
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:51,600
yeah so

1692
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,960
or or even just s star is a a special

1693
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,120
character it's a wild card which means

1694
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,159
anything

1695
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,239
so uh that's useful in regular

1696
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:01,580
expressions

1697
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:04,320
[Music]

1698
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,760
basically what this is going to do so

1699
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,600
you can't actually make new files on

1700
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,800
uh

1701
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,400
in this

1702
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,320
because they've locked it down in that

1703
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,960
way but you can go to

1704
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:19,890
um

1705
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:22,560
[Music]

1706
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,360
the

1707
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,840
temp directory you can see it has a

1708
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,440
special

1709
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,840
characteristic that you can basically

1710
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,120
always use it

1711
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,159
oops

1712
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:35,040
cd into slash tmp

1713
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,320
because this is

1714
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,480
in the root directory

1715
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,760
uh so you can't actually run ls

1716
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,440
this is the one directory you can't do

1717
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,159
that unless you set another directory to

1718
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:49,600
have those permissions but um

1719
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,880
what you can do is make a directory

1720
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,199
mkdir

1721
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:57,040
and just name it whatever you want so

1722
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,920
just e3

1723
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,040
test

1724
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:04,560
so i can't actually see that but i can

1725
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,600
change directory into it

1726
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,440
and now i have

1727
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,679
now i can do whatever i want so touch

1728
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,360
basically

1729
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,840
makes a file i mean what it does is it

1730
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,480
updates the time stamp

1731
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,800
but if the file doesn't exist it creates

1732
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,440
it with nothing in it so now i have a

1733
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,679
file called a but if i cat it there's

1734
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,120
nothing in it

1735
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,080
so um

1736
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,239
so what does home look like again

1737
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:39,520
so spaces in this file name um

1738
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,280
i don't even remember why i was doing

1739
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,159
all this

1740
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:44,638
but uh

1741
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,760
i can't find spaces in this phone

1742
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,800
well anyway

1743
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,800
uh that'll be useful later but

1744
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,560
i'm just going to cat

1745
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,320
space oh yeah the you're going to do

1746
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,639
star right you're saying star so if i

1747
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:06,639
create multiple files um

1748
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,040
so touch well i guess

1749
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,050
um

1750
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:13,229
[Music]

1751
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,400
i'm going to echo which prints

1752
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,040
uh prints to the screen

1753
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,400
without like

1754
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,880
making a file uh and what i'm gonna do

1755
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,760
is i'm going to redirect the output so

1756
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:26,800
normally

1757
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,719
it it's directed into standard output

1758
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:32,320
std out

1759
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,600
um

1760
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,000
but i can redirect it with this symbol

1761
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,639
and put it into a file so i'm going to

1762
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:40,960
create a file called

1763
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,760
a or a

1764
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,639
a file

1765
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:49,440
so i tap a file

1766
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,679
oh actually i already have a right so

1767
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:53,840
when i hit tab to auto complete it's

1768
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,520
like oh there's two files here which one

1769
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:56,800
do you mean

1770
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,560
but if i wanted to

1771
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,480
i believe there's nothing in a so i'm

1772
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,639
going to echo

1773
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:03,679
test

1774
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,600
2

1775
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,040
into

1776
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,800
a

1777
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,040
now there's something in both files

1778
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,520
so if i do

1779
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,880
uh cat

1780
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,120
a star

1781
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,560
it's actually going to print both those

1782
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,000
files out

1783
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,159
because

1784
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:25,040
a basically means zero or more

1785
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,880
of anything

1786
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:27,840
so

1787
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,520
a fulfills this

1788
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:33,280
and then a file also fulfills this so if

1789
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,199
so what i was saying before

1790
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:36,000
was

1791
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,360
in in here if there is more than one

1792
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,119
more than one

1793
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:42,880
file that starts with s

1794
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,960
i would need to

1795
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,960
i would want to be careful about using

1796
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,800
the star so if there was something that

1797
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,920
started with s but not sp i could do cat

1798
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,760
s

1799
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,639
p star and that would be specific enough

1800
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,239
i mean you can do

1801
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:01,520
you can do as as specific as you want

1802
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,719
um

1803
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:06,159
but i always i'm like it's always good

1804
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,400
habit in cyber and all this stuff is to

1805
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,239
be as lazy as possible

1806
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,960
and uh you know let the computer do the

1807
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,080
work for you so i'm just going to

1808
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,360
and that's why i spent so much time

1809
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,560
explaining all the different ways to do

1810
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,320
this so uh

1811
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,880
i'm gonna go to the next

1812
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:25,960
level um

1813
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:29,370
[Music]

1814
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,520
so what is the next level um the

1815
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,280
password for the next level is stored in

1816
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,440
a hidden file in the in here directory

1817
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,040
so i've already sort of given the answer

1818
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,920
to this with uh reading the man page to

1819
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,639
ls but if you do dash a

1820
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:44,560
it does not ignore the entry starting

1821
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:47,440
with dot all the hidden files so i can

1822
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:51,760
just do ls-a and here or actually

1823
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:56,159
in here isn't hidden but if i cd in here

1824
01:35:56,159 --> 01:36:00,080
and then do lsa here is the hidden file

1825
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,880
and also i said before you can specify

1826
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,520
what folder you want to run ls on so i

1827
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,679
can do ls

1828
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,600
a

1829
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,880
in here

1830
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,400
and it's going to open that file and run

1831
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,639
run whatever i've decided these are

1832
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,560
called flags the dashes

1833
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,480
like the dash characters

1834
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:23,119
um so if i want to cap that i can just

1835
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:25,679
do cat

1836
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:27,040
in here

1837
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,040
and then it'll know

1838
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,480
that's the only file in there so i can

1839
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,320
just press tab

1840
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,679
um

1841
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,760
or i can do dot tab

1842
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,560
actually i can't because there's

1843
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,080
the pointers to

1844
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,920
the that directory and the parent

1845
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,119
directory

1846
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:46,000
um as you can see here

1847
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,400
you have a question

1848
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:49,679
no

1849
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,760
how about sub

1850
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,719
to the

1851
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:54,560
parent directory but how about the

1852
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,360
subdirectory so the subdirectory is just

1853
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,520
uh it's just going to be named

1854
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,480
like in in this folder

1855
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:05,280
uh we can see everything that's here so

1856
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,560
there's a

1857
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,480
i'll call it a pointer to the current

1858
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,360
directory the parent directory and then

1859
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,040
anything that's named is going to be a

1860
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,480
subdirectory

1861
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,440
um

1862
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,480
if it's blue that's how it's shown here

1863
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,400
if it's white it's a file

1864
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,920
um i can run file on in here

1865
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,640
and it'll tell me it's a directory

1866
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:28,679
[Music]

1867
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,040
yeah that's true

1868
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:34,239
and if you do a cat

1869
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:35,280
star

1870
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,800
would it list

1871
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,280
the content of the files in their

1872
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:42,560
subdirectory also uh no

1873
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,040
generally not the

1874
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:46,480
there's um

1875
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,080
if you want to list the files in a

1876
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,360
subdirectory you would probably use find

1877
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,520
and you can recursively

1878
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,030
do that ls might have a recursive

1879
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:59,600
[Music]

1880
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,239
yeah it has a recursive thing so if you

1881
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:04,639
want to run ls

1882
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:05,840
applebar

1883
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,440
it'll print out

1884
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,199
dot so in dot colon this is inside the

1885
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:14,000
current directory is in here and then

1886
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,719
dot slash in here colon there's nothing

1887
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:20,400
inside here but if you do dash

1888
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,679
ls ra and you can do it you can separate

1889
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,320
these flags like this or you can stack

1890
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,880
them up it depends on the command and

1891
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,560
it's pretty inconsistent

1892
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:32,400
but uh if you read the manual for each

1893
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,679
one it'll tell you

1894
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:36,239
uh and you can see here's every file in

1895
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,920
our current directory and here's all the

1896
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,960
files inside this directory

1897
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,040
so i'm going to

1898
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:47,360
just catch in here dot hidden

1899
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,920
and there we go

1900
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,560
any uh any comments

1901
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:58,199
i should probably be

1902
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,159
the name hidden is just

1903
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,880
carva curry right yes yes

1904
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,840
so

1905
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,159
q okay yes

1906
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,360
so fun fact i i tried to open it with

1907
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,159
less

1908
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:24,480
uh it's the opposite of more what is

1909
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,000
more

1910
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:26,880
uh

1911
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,440
a file perusal filter so you can open

1912
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:30,960
things with more and then some like

1913
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,679
there's a lot of people being clever um

1914
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:35,920
in their naming conventions of things

1915
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,360
and uh

1916
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,400
so

1917
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,510
yes why is

1918
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:44,999
[Music]

1919
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,600
[Music]

1920
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,560
so okay so this is the the name of the

1921
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,199
file isn't

1922
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,678
in here

1923
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,600
slash

1924
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,840
dot hidden right that's it's the

1925
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,920
location so if

1926
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,800
there it's all the the spaces after the

1927
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,199
slashes was was more i think that was

1928
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:12,480
just escaping the spaces

1929
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,839
for the spaces in the file name

1930
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,880
yeah so

1931
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,440
remembering to do forward or backslash

1932
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,320
it can be kind of annoying especially if

1933
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,840
you're working in between

1934
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,800
windows and linux because windows

1935
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,960
doesn't separate directories

1936
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,080
like this

1937
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,960
uh i can just open up my uh

1938
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,400
like command line you can see

1939
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,280
here it's c

1940
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:46,719
is that backslash does that board slash

1941
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:47,920
that's back

1942
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,000
so this one uses backslash to separate

1943
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,760
the directory so in my c

1944
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:52,719
drive

1945
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,000
slash users

1946
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,600
arrow is my username

1947
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:56,560
um

1948
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,400
but in linux

1949
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,239
uh you can do pwd

1950
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,800
you know it's forward slash home form

1951
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,639
slash

1952
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:06,400
so you know

1953
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,960
this this is kind of the

1954
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,000
syntax

1955
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:10,719
yeah

1956
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:12,719
this is the kind of thing though that it

1957
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:14,560
just takes all i mean you'll still mess

1958
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,639
it up you know even if you're doing it

1959
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:19,520
full-time uh every so often no other

1960
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,199
fancy words for backslash and forward

1961
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:24,480
slash that's it

1962
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,600
i've never heard it anywhere

1963
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:31,120
okay um

1964
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:34,220
[Music]

1965
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,840
yeah

1966
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,199
well

1967
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:51,520
like any anyone that's hacked into your

1968
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,280
machine will probably know how to search

1969
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,800
for hidden files

1970
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,400
uh

1971
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,920
because that's

1972
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,920
like

1973
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,400
well so so a lot of hidden files are

1974
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,119
just configuration files so right beyond

1975
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:12,480
that

1976
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,959
is any

1977
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:28,050
[Music]

1978
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,960
well if i run the directory command on

1979
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,080
windows

1980
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,800
like

1981
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,880
i still get these dots and i get all

1982
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,480
these configuration

1983
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,560
files that i don't necessarily need i

1984
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,000
mean some of these are directories these

1985
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:46,960
are the

1986
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,159
config but if i'm just looking for like

1987
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:51,760
you know my desktop downloads i don't

1988
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,119
really care about that kind of stuff

1989
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:54,840
right

1990
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,960
so like

1991
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,239
bash rc

1992
01:42:58,239 --> 01:42:59,840
like you may want to change that every

1993
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,440
so often

1994
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,400
like

1995
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,199
for

1996
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:05,600
you know adding aliases or

1997
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,520
stuff to make your life easier but like

1998
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,360
that gets run every time you open the

1999
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,880
terminal it's not something that you're

2000
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,679
like going to be editing every time you

2001
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:16,080
open a folder right so i don't need to

2002
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,960
see everything

2003
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,280
i mean

2004
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,960
anyway

2005
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,230
uh okay so

2006
01:43:25,230 --> 01:43:27,360
[Music]

2007
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,080
oh yeah so

2008
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,639
there's other ways i think if you didn't

2009
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:34,480
find dot

2010
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,360
uh

2011
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,600
find dot will

2012
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,320
print everything

2013
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:44,400
and i can just do cat

2014
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,520
this

2015
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,320
and i describe it

2016
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:59,409
[Music]

2017
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:04,320
so for

2018
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:08,960
this one getting from b4 to b5

2019
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,119
there's

2020
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:13,280
something stored there's a password

2021
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,960
stored in a file inside this directory

2022
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,080
so what's in this directory

2023
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,840
many files and they all start with dash

2024
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,360
which is annoying

2025
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,599
uh

2026
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,800
but we need to get something that's

2027
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,679
human readable and

2028
01:44:30,679 --> 01:44:35,119
1033 bytes in size and not executable

2029
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:36,239
so

2030
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:38,960
this one it's easy enough to not

2031
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,280
uh

2032
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,239
to uh

2033
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:45,280
not there

2034
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:48,679
wouldn't hello

2035
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,760
well nothing is executable so

2036
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,679
that is actually

2037
01:44:57,679 --> 01:44:59,840
what we're looking for but that doesn't

2038
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,840
narrow it down right besides this match

2039
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,360
so

2040
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:09,520
you can get uh more specific um i think

2041
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:13,000
the fine command

2042
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:19,440
find command has a size

2043
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,719
uh

2044
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:21,600
flag

2045
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,239
so file uses n units of space rounding

2046
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:27,280
up the following suffixes can be used so

2047
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,960
c for bytes

2048
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:32,000
so if you run find

2049
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,119
in

2050
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,480
in here

2051
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,400
specify location

2052
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:37,530
dash size

2053

01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,719
1033c

2055
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:46,719
i may need to switch this

2056
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:54,840
no i was wrong

2057
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,840
what

2058
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,970
[Music]

2059
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:25,239
all the files

2060
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,400
and

2061
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,199
okay well

2062
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:47,480
it says rounding up

2063
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:07,440
so it is um

2064
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,560
it's going to be

2065
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,800
[Music]

2066
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,440
the option

2067
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,320
what would it be find dash size and then

2068
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,239
the path i

2069
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:23,839
i tried that

2070
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,800
well i have my

2071
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:28,880
so this is the time if anyone has solved

2072
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:31,510
this what about it

2073
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:34,609
[Music]

2074
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,119
what about adding a star after the

2075
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,570
forward slash into the path

2076
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:43,920
[Music]

2077
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,400
i'll just try 33 it looks like all of

2078
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,750
those are 50 bytes

2079
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:49,119
[Music]

2080
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:50,719
yeah

2081
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:54,800
so maybe is this even the wrong one

2082
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:57,840
the password this might i might be

2083
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,239
doing the wrong level

2084
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,718
uh so

2085
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,480
so um

2086
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,239
if you do

2087
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:07,440
file

2088
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,080
in here star

2089
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,199
we can see

2090
01:48:11,199 --> 01:48:12,880
only one of these is actually human

2091
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,239
readable

2092
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:16,080
so that would be

2093
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:19,020
my solution to this um

2094
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:20,880
[Music]

2095
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,199
and

2096
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:30,719
so that's an answer but there's um

2097
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:34,400
there's different ways of like

2098
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:35,840
so

2099
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,600
if you don't want to have to copy

2100
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,480
anything you can do many steps of like a

2101
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,239
little text string and string

2102
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,239
manipulation so

2103
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:45,760
okay

2104
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,480
i'm gonna use the pipe command which

2105
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,719
basically is like redirect but it's

2106
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:53,119
redirecting it into another command and

2107
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:54,880
not into a file

2108
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,800
um i would that's how i would specify it

2109
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,199
if anyone else

2110
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,320
um wants to say anything but uh the

2111
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,080
the um

2112
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:09,119
so here's a bunch of files oops

2113
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,199
here's here's a bunch of files right

2114
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:13,360
we're looking for the human readable one

2115
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:16,480
so we can actually use the grep command

2116
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:19,199
to basically filter for to include

2117
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:20,719
something so we're looking for something

2118
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,000
that

2119
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,719
if we didn't see all this we say grab

2120
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:27,119
text because we know human readable it's

2121
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,119
going to be readable as text

2122
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:30,560
but

2123
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:31,599
maybe

2124
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:34,000
like i can't actually open that

2125
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,480
so i'm going to pipe it again

2126
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,759
and try to cut

2127
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,599
i'm going to set the delimiter

2128
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:45,760
to

2129
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:48,320
colon

2130
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,400
and

2131
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:52,159
i actually have to specify the field so

2132
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:54,480
if i say field 1 it's going to cut

2133
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:57,360
everything before the colon if i say

2134
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,679
field two it's gonna say everything

2135
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,119
after the colon

2136
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:03,360
so now i actually

2137
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,920
just have the file name

2138
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:09,400
and i can

2139
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:13,280
i can now uh open it

2140
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,880
anyone has any ideas of how to do that

2141
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:20,239
so you can try to cat it

2142
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,560
sometimes if that feels i just use nano

2143
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,560
just

2144
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:29,839
well i think you can do x arcs

2145
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,880
yeah

2146
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:38,400
so um

2147
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,639
x-arbs

2148
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:42,800
basically

2149
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,239
will run

2150
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:46,880
will run commands for you uh it reads

2151
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,920
items from the standard input

2152
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:53,360
and executes the command so this is kind

2153
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:54,639
of

2154
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:56,719
a nice uh

2155
01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:58,320
workaround because

2156
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,400
you can't actually pipe anything into

2157
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,599
cat

2158
01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:04,159
um and you can't actually like you can't

2159
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:08,080
redirect it into cat if you try that

2160
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:09,520
it's going to try and create a file

2161
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:10,639
named cat

2162
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:11,920
so um

2163
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,400
x-args is a really powerful command

2164
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,000
that'll basically just pass the

2165
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,159
arguments from the previous

2166
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:20,480
whatever is directed into it into the

2167
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,000
command as if it were

2168
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
standard input

2169
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,080
so that's a fancy way of doing it i

2170
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,840
don't know if anyone else

2171
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:31,280
wants to do it i have a fast way

2172
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,440
go for it strings strings

2173
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,360
yeah

2174
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,599
so man strings

2175
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:41,199
uh prints the strings of printable

2176
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:43,280
characters and files

2177
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:46,800
so you can use this on

2178
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:49,440
photos with metadata you can use this on

2179
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,040
any it's like one of the first things

2180
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:54,000
you do in like a ctf trying to identify

2181
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,080
uh is there any information in this in

2182
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,320
this of this file that uh give me

2183
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:02,000
something so if i run strings on in here

2184
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,199
star

2185
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:06,320
it's going to print out all of the human

2186
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:09,280
readable strings

2187
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:11,280
as in like there can be a lot of byte

2188
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,320
code

2189
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:13,760
in different files and this will just

2190
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:16,320
print out the human readable so that's

2191
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:17,840
that's really useful

2192
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:21,440
um but if there was a lot of

2193
01:52:21,440 --> 01:52:23,679
if there's a lot of stuff in these files

2194
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:25,599
uh even if it's human readable it still

2195
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:27,440
can be nonsense i mean this is human

2196
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,840
readable but like

2197
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,679
like if you know exactly how long the

2198
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:32,960
password is

2199
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:34,560
which i believe all these passwords are

2200
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,159
the same length you could sort by that

2201
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:38,159
but imagine that there's pages and pages

2202
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,239
of output here like you you want to be

2203
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:42,960
able to be as specific as possible and

2204
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,320
just just preparing for like the future

2205
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,080
in case there's some edge case that

2206
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:49,760
you're not aware of like being as

2207
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:52,159
specific as possible with your commands

2208
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:54,080
um if you're going to save them and like

2209
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:57,119
rerun them um in a script

2210
01:52:57,119 --> 01:53:00,080
is can can help you a lot uh

2211
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,440
on the way there but

2212
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,199
like there's many many different ways

2213
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:05,280
you can get to these these passwords

2214
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,840
and uh

2215
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:11,960
so here we go

2216
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:17,440
i think i hit s before i pasted

2217
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,719
all right

2218
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:24,239
so i'm gonna do like

2219
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:26,480
a couple more i guess

2220
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:27,679
um

2221
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:30,560
and then uh and hopefully you'll you'll

2222
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,960
uh have enough inspiration to

2223
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,560
do the rest of them there's some that

2224
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,400
are really interesting i might just do

2225
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:39,280
like 20 28 or something

2226
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,080
um just to show but uh since this is

2227
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:44,560
kind of like a for for beginners or like

2228
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,119
just some linux tricks that

2229
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:51,840
anyone will find useful uh i figured i'd

2230
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,320
keep going so all right so again in the

2231
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:57,040
in here directory

2232
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:59,679
so now we have subdirectories

2233
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:01,679
so if you remember r

2234
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:04,480
recursive so we can see

2235
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,159
oh lord here's a bunch of files with

2236
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:08,080
dashes in front of them so we can't cap

2237
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:08,960
them

2238
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,199
there's spaces in the files so we're

2239
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:13,360
going to probably want to use

2240
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:15,599
some sort of regex to open it instead of

2241
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:18,480
or like a wild card instead of

2242
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,920
like actually going through and trying

2243
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,920
to open all these files individually

2244
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:25,599
doesn't make sense right so

2245
01:54:26,050 --> 01:54:28,719
[Music]

2246
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:30,560
it's a green invite

2247
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,000
so um

2248
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,480
you can run file to see

2249
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:36,799
um

2250
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:47,199
[Music]

2251
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:48,239
so

2252
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:51,280
the file one green this is ascii text

2253
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:53,119
with very long lines that's gonna show

2254
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:55,040
the same color as ascii text

2255
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,639
dash file

2256
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,320
three

2257
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,080
gosh

2258
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,639
so file two huh

2259
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:04,960
usually it's uh it actually means a

2260
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,440
different thing

2261
01:55:11,199 --> 01:55:14,080
if i run ls in here yeah same same

2262
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:17,080
coloration

2263
01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:20,639
it usually indicates a different um

2264
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,639
file type so let's see

2265
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:25,920
spaces file two

2266
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:41,059
[Music]

2267
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:47,520
so

2268
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:50,960
it's actually the permissions i think

2269
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:52,320
um

2270
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:55,360
yeah so if it's executable it's green

2271
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:59,799
if it's not executable it's white

2272
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:05,840
okay so

2273
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:08,000
what are we actually looking for

2274
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,159
um i think this is now the human

2275
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:11,360
readable

2276
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:12,159
thing

2277
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:15,119
so if we want to do find

2278
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:17,519
dot

2279
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:21,280
size 1033

2280
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,840
oh uh we need to recursively check does

2281
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,080
that

2282
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:29,840
how do you reverse and find

2283
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:40,280
let's do it automatically

2284
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:48,880
so it does

2285
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:51,040
it does uh

2286
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,960
find every file within this directory

2287
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,199
and the subdirectories so if i do find

2288
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:56,560
in here

2289
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:59,199
uh type

2290
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:00,960
f for file

2291
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:06,400
and size 1033 oh i didn't specify bytes

2292
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,879
there we go

2293
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:12,080
so uh i was just saying 1033 that's why

2294
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,199
there wasn't anything

2295
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:15,280
so i don't even think we need to specify

2296
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:16,400
the type

2297
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:18,159
but

2298
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:20,480
being as specific as possible is good uh

2299
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:21,920
practice

2300
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:23,920
and so if i want to open this i can do

2301
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:27,040
xrs cat

2302
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:28,160
actually

2303
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:31,349
[Music]

2304
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:34,239
there is an exec

2305
01:57:34,239 --> 01:57:36,480
for find command specifically there is

2306
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:39,839
an exact

2307
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:53,890
execute so i think you can do

2308
01:57:53,890 --> 01:57:55,199
[Music]

2309
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:59,638
dash exact like this

2310
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:08,229
[Music]

2311
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:14,799
so the exact option of find

2312
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:17,760
so

2313
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,040
with the

2314
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,840
um

2315
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,960
so the basic usage of exec

2316
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,080
takes

2317
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:33,760
an external utility with optional

2318
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:36,000
arguments as its argument and executes

2319
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,159
it if the string

2320
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:39,840
is present anywhere on the given command

2321
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:41,840
each instance of it will be replaced by

2322
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:45,599
the path name currently being processed

2323
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:49,440
so we're gonna basically

2324
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:52,800
replace the output here with

2325
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:55,040
inside these uh

2326
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:56,320
these

2327
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,920
curly braces

2328
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,080
so i believe you can i

2329
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:03,440
might be this no

2330
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:07,040
so it's a goal to do it in one command

2331
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:10,719
because we know exact file

2332
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,599
yeah i mean we can just we can just cat

2333
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:16,239
it but i just thought it would be uh i

2334
01:59:16,239 --> 01:59:17,760
think i think it's just you have to

2335
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,719
follow it up with um

2336
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:52,040
oh that looks right

2337
02:00:00,830 --> 02:00:04,920
[Music]

2338
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,080
and then you see if it's

2339
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:14,290
[Music]

2340
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:24,320
oh

2341
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:27,040
let's

2342
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:38,000
[Music]

2343
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:42,159
the other way to do that is just uh

2344
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:44,639
grab it

2345
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:47,199
copy it

2346
02:00:47,199 --> 02:00:49,360
but i thought i would make it difficult

2347
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:51,599
but because of all the spaces

2348
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:53,040
you could also

2349
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,920
if you didn't want all that um

2350
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:58,400
you could run strings like uh

2351
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:01,360
max pointed out

2352
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:05,040
and that's also all text so

2353
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:09,639
that still counts as a string oh well

2354
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:20,069
[Music]

2355
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:22,080
also

2356
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:25,149
[Music]

2357
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:32,369
[Music]

2358
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:36,400
this is about like user groups

2359
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:38,560
users and groups so the password to the

2360
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,400
next question is stored somewhere on the

2361
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:42,719
server and has the following properties

2362
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:46,400
so you can run any find command on slash

2363
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:47,520
on root

2364
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,599
but that's gonna go through every file

2365
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:51,760
in the whole computer including folders

2366
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:53,040
that

2367
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,040
just contain processes because

2368
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,199
everything in linux is a file

2369
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:59,360
so

2370
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:02,159
having these specifications will narrow

2371
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:03,760
it down a bit but you're still going to

2372
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,360
try to open a bunch of files you don't

2373
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,960
have permission to open

2374
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:10,400
so what you can do is

2375
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:12,480
type that output

2376
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:15,840
redirect the output rather to

2377
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:17,280
a device

2378
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,040
on linux called null

2379
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:21,199
that you can just basically send

2380
02:02:21,199 --> 02:02:22,800
everything you don't want into the

2381
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,080
garbage can

2382
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:25,670
into so

2383
02:02:25,670 --> 02:02:27,840
[Music]

2384
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,280
so

2385
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:32,239
standard and standard out

2386
02:02:32,239 --> 02:02:34,239
there's a couple different

2387
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:36,560
a couple different things there so

2388
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,920
zero i believe is standard in

2389
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:42,480
one is standard out and two is standard

2390
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,360
error

2391
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:44,840
so if you wanna

2392
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:48,000
redirect the output

2393
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,159
the normal output you can you can do

2394
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:51,599
that

2395
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:53,920
with one or it'll you don't even need to

2396
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:55,520
specify that

2397
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,480
because

2398
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:58,560
just using

2399
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:02,400
here i'm going to go into cd temp slash

2400
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,960
what was it

2401
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:08,819
[Music]

2402
02:03:10,239 --> 02:03:11,280
test

2403
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:14,280
444.

2404
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,960
[Music]

2405
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:21,440
cd and here's a little neat thing

2406
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:24,320
uh if the you can select the last

2407
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:25,170
the last um

2408
02:03:25,170 --> 02:03:26,960
[Music]

2409
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:28,480
valid uh

2410
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:31,599
submitted argument with uh in bash with

2411
02:03:31,599 --> 02:03:34,320
dollar sign underscore

2412
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:37,599
and so that actually

2413
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:39,040
filled that in

2414
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:43,159
i always think that's neat

2415
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,199
will fill in

2416
02:03:47,199 --> 02:03:50,400
the last argument that was

2417
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:53,400
valid

2418
02:03:53,530 --> 02:03:56,480
[Music]

2419
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:58,880
uh well let's see so i'm gonna make

2420
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:01,760
directory temp

2421
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:02,880
uh

2422
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:05,280
test four four four i'm just gonna say

2423
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:06,639
i mean some of these will probably be

2424
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:07,960
taken

2425
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:09,840
but

2426
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:11,599
maybe just for ease i'm just gonna go

2427
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:16,560
here uh make directory a b c d e

2428
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:19,360
and then i'm gonna cd into it

2429
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:21,679
it's the last valid

2430
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:24,800
argument that was passed

2431
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,760
that's like just a fun thing that i

2432
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:32,040
found extremely useful

2433
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:33,119
[Music]

2434
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:34,239
uh

2435
02:04:34,239 --> 02:04:36,880
so i showed the history command too

2436
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:37,760
um

2437
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,360
which

2438
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:41,119
prints a list of all your previous

2439
02:04:41,119 --> 02:04:43,360
commands and it's stored in dot bash

2440
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:45,520
history in your home directory i believe

2441
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,280
and if you do

2442
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,760
question or exclamation mark

2443
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:51,599
and then the number so i'm going to go

2444
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:53,360
up a directory

2445
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:55,599
so that'll that'll that'll it'll tell me

2446
02:04:55,599 --> 02:04:58,159
what the commando is wrong right there

2447
02:04:58,159 --> 02:05:00,400
but another thing you can do is actually

2448
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,000
the wrong one too

2449
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,360
let's say you have to draw a whole bunch

2450
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,639
before you get it right

2451
02:05:04,639 --> 02:05:06,639
the history would list everything yeah

2452
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:08,239
yeah the wrong one

2453
02:05:08,239 --> 02:05:11,679
yeah so you can so now though

2454
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:13,599
dollar sign underscore the last valid

2455
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:15,360
argument that was passed

2456
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:16,480
is different

2457
02:05:16,480 --> 02:05:19,119
so now if i run that

2458
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:21,599
i'm actually i'm i'm actually going up a

2459
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:24,079
directory right because the last valid

2460
02:05:24,079 --> 02:05:26,079
argument that was passed is

2461
02:05:26,079 --> 02:05:27,119
dot dot

2462
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:29,599
so this is actually

2463
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:31,440
re-running this command

2464
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:33,199
which is fine um

2465
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:34,400
one fun thing

2466
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:35,360
uh

2467
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,840
also is exclamation point exclamation

2468
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:39,119
point

2469
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:40,560
uh which will

2470
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:44,480
run the previous command you just ran

2471
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:46,159
so that'll that'll that's not just the

2472
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:48,320
argument that was passed it's the entire

2473
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:51,520
thing so that's that's useful and you

2474
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:53,760
can also

2475
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:55,520
you can also uh include it in other

2476
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:57,199
stuff so

2477
02:05:57,199 --> 02:05:59,519
um

2478
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:02,719
what's uh what's the command

2479
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:05,719
interpolations

2480
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:16,770
[Music]

2481
02:06:21,190 --> 02:06:34,400
[Music]

2482
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:37,400
um

2483
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:53,280
shell embedding

2484
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,760
and substitution

2485
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:59,199
yeah so back ticks i was just trying to

2486
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:01,598
look up

2487
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:04,000
there's another way of specifying

2488
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,440
command substitution besides backticks

2489
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:10,239
yes dollar sign sorry

2490
02:07:10,239 --> 02:07:11,599
so you can

2491
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:13,760
you can um

2492
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:15,280
run a command

2493
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,119
within so

2494
02:07:17,119 --> 02:07:18,320
if you're like combining a lot of

2495
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:20,960
different commands um sometimes like

2496
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:24,239
having to pass into x args instead of

2497
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:26,239
doing whatever running exact instead

2498
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:28,320
like instead of piping like piping is

2499
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:29,920
the most simple thing where it's like

2500
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:31,920
here's the output put into this pipe

2501
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:34,079
into this pipe into this uh but then

2502
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:35,920
you'll run into fans like cat that you

2503
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,480
can't pipe into so you have to there's

2504
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:41,840
all these things so like you can run

2505
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:43,760
inside another command

2506
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,360
you can run

2507
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:46,880
you can basically

2508
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:49,599
specify another kind of run so uh if you

2509
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:54,159
if you did something like um

2510
02:07:54,159 --> 02:07:55,920
i don't know uh

2511
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:56,719
so

2512
02:07:56,719 --> 02:07:58,480
cat a

2513
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:00,000
and then

2514
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,880
i wanted to

2515
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:06,239
like echo

2516
02:08:06,239 --> 02:08:07,840
that command

2517
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:10,560
output into a file

2518
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:13,280
i could say

2519
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:14,639
i can

2520
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:18,000
basically i'm going to

2521
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:19,199
insert

2522
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:21,599
a substitute a command

2523
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:23,119
and this is going to be the previous

2524
02:08:23,119 --> 02:08:24,079
command

2525
02:08:24,079 --> 02:08:25,760
and i'm going to

2526
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:27,679
pass it into b so this is the actual

2527
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:29,360
full command that was just run

2528
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:31,280
so i'm going to let's see what actually

2529
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,040
happened in b

2530
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:34,840
so what happened

2531
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:37,360
was um

2532
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:38,800
i

2533
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:41,360
printed out the output of this command

2534
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:43,360
which was something being printed and

2535
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:45,920
then redirected that output into b so

2536
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:48,000
this is like a pretty cool

2537
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,400
thing that has a lot of implications but

2538
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,638
um

2539
02:08:56,239 --> 02:08:59,920
uh these a and b are files

2540
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:01,520
so there's double explanation means the

2541
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,199
previous command yeah

2542
02:09:03,199 --> 02:09:04,800
so these are just like little linux

2543
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:06,880
things that i learned at one point and

2544
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:07,760
then

2545
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,040
i'm like you don't know what you don't

2546
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,239
know it's like

2547
02:09:10,239 --> 02:09:13,440
like these things are so useless

2548
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:17,040
and i don't know for is it on there

2549
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:20,079
uh yeah but it's like to get to the

2550
02:09:20,079 --> 02:09:23,920
point where you would read that yeah

2551
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:25,440
so i don't know if anyone has cool linux

2552
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:27,440
stuff they want to show up

2553
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:29,599
i'm trying to make this beginner and

2554
02:09:29,599 --> 02:09:32,599
also

2555
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:35,040
um

2556
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:37,119
so hopefully i'm not like overloading

2557
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:40,799
people that are just starting but um

2558
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:44,639
redirecting yeah

2559
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:47,840
so um

2560
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,440
piping is

2561
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:50,320
uh

2562
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:53,679
taking the output of

2563
02:09:53,679 --> 02:09:55,040
another command

2564
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,679
it's basically redirecting

2565
02:09:57,679 --> 02:10:01,560
standard in i believe

2566
02:10:04,159 --> 02:10:06,639
it's redirecting into standard in so

2567
02:10:06,639 --> 02:10:07,679
it's like

2568
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:10,000
where where a command expects to get

2569
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,840
information from so normally

2570
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:16,880
here a a is like the

2571
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:18,880
um

2572
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:20,560
what we're typing in like we're typing

2573
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:23,119
in cat a so that's that's standard

2574
02:10:23,119 --> 02:10:24,320
um

2575
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:25,840
what just got printed out is standard

2576
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:29,040
out if there is an error like

2577
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:31,280
uh if we run ls here

2578
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:34,000
you can't open this permission denied

2579
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,119
uh

2580
02:10:35,119 --> 02:10:38,000
if i don't want to get that

2581
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,679
what i can do is i can redirect

2582
02:10:41,679 --> 02:10:42,560
to

2583
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,760
which

2584
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:46,960
is not very explicit but i said before

2585
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:48,400
standard n

2586
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:49,679
is zero

2587
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:50,800
standard

2588
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:51,840
or

2589
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,599
standard out is one

2590
02:10:53,599 --> 02:10:55,760
and standard error is too

2591
02:10:55,760 --> 02:11:00,079
so i can actually redirect this into

2592
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:03,440
i mean i can redirect it into uh

2593
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:04,960
e slash

2594
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:05,679
c

2595
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:06,800
well

2596
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,560
can i no

2597
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:12,239
i guess maybe all right go into e

2598
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:15,119
and now there's c if i can't see

2599
02:11:15,119 --> 02:11:16,880
here is that error

2600
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:18,960
so i redirected the error instead of

2601
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:21,199
printing it to the terminal i printed it

2602
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:22,320
to a file

2603
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:23,599
if you want to just throw it into the

2604
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:24,960
void

2605
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:26,719
um

2606
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:29,360
so if i do ls

2607
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:32,320
ls dot dot here's this error you can do

2608
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:34,480
two redirected into

2609
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:35,760
device

2610
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,040
null

2611
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:38,320
this is just a thing you have to

2612
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:39,360
remember

2613
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:41,520
or write down

2614
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:42,639
and uh

2615
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:44,239
it doesn't go anywhere it's basically

2616
02:11:44,239 --> 02:11:47,280
piped into the garbage can

2617
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:49,199
so if you print it out if you're

2618
02:11:49,199 --> 02:11:51,520
printing out a lot of stuff that had

2619
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,719
good and bad

2620
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:54,560
you want and you just want to get the

2621
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:56,159
good stuff

2622
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:58,239
you can pipe the bad stuff somewhere

2623
02:11:58,239 --> 02:12:00,880
else and just save the good stuff yeah

2624
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:02,639
so that's actually what we're gonna do

2625
02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:05,199
this all had a point uh for this for

2626
02:12:05,199 --> 02:12:08,560
this uh for this thing so if i run find

2627
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:09,440
on

2628
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:10,719
slash

2629
02:12:10,719 --> 02:12:13,599
like here's every file on this computer

2630
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:16,079
i'm gonna get a lot of permission denied

2631
02:12:16,079 --> 02:12:17,920
um

2632
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:19,440
i'm actually not seeing that much of

2633
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:21,119
that but i am seeing a lot of stuff that

2634
02:12:21,119 --> 02:12:23,040
i don't need to see right

2635
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:24,239
um

2636
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:27,360
does the null get cleaned out instantly

2637
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:28,560
yeah yeah

2638
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:30,159
it's

2639
02:12:30,159 --> 02:12:31,280
so if i

2640
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:33,599
find something i

2641
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:35,280
end it

2642
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,119
user bandit seven

2643
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:38,639
so i can do

2644
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:40,800
user i believe

2645
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:43,360
ended seven

2646
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:45,599
group

2647
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:45,950
six

2648
02:12:45,950 --> 02:12:47,119
[Music]

2649
02:12:47,119 --> 02:12:50,239
and dash size

2650
02:12:50,239 --> 02:12:53,280
uh 33 bytes

2651
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:54,719
uh you can see there's all this

2652
02:12:54,719 --> 02:12:56,400
permission denied here

2653
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:58,480
so we do find this password here but say

2654
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:00,719
i just want the good stuff

2655
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:02,580
i can say 2 2

2656
02:13:02,580 --> 02:13:05,720
[Music]

2657
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:09,599
and i just get the right thing

2658
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:10,719
so uh

2659
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:12,530
yeah that's it

2660
02:13:12,530 --> 02:13:14,880
[Music]

2661
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:17,119
so um didn't really spend much time on

2662
02:13:17,119 --> 02:13:18,719
under the wire

2663
02:13:18,719 --> 02:13:20,239
but uh

2664
02:13:20,239 --> 02:13:21,840
you can definitely do that on your own

2665
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:22,719
time

2666
02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:25,280
uh there's more than enough things to

2667
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:28,159
learn about linux

2668
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:31,599
forever uh but uh i hope that that was

2669
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:33,840
uh at least somewhat interesting i

2670
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:36,400
