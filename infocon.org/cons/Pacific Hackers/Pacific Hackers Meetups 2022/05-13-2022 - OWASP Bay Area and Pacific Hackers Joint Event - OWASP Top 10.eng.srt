1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,000
so

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,639
injection can happen in a lot of ways so

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,840
one of the

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,160
like even in like security orchestration

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,960
environments so like maybe uh like a

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,000
security uh operations engineer

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
uh wrote a

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,240
a uh security orchestration automated

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
response that's that sore means uh wrote

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
a uh a script that will repeatedly call

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,520
an api to get logs to go into

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,320
a centralized logging environment uh a

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
sim

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,840
so

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,800
you know maybe you trust your

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,079
mssp

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,680
or whoever

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,399
you know built this api or you know what

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,960
have you but if you aren't actually

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,320
escaping that stuff uh you can have

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,000
i guess this is technically supply chain

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,399
compromise uh but it's you know it's

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
just a trusted trusted partner

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,319
compromise in that sense so

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,639
um

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
so you wanna even if you don't think

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,159
this this code even if your code is not

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,840
uh outward facing even if it's not a web

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,920
application uh you definitely want to

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,280
make sure you

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
know what you're taking in and you're

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,200
you're uh

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
escaping it uh and parsing it

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
uh safely

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,600
and there's a lot of different uh

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,240
generally the advice is uh you don't

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,640
wanna reinvent the wheel um there's

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,960
already existing uh functions in

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,159
whatever

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,680
there's already a library for

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
cryptographic stuff but uh for

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,159
for for any of this uh safe safe

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,920
escaping for whatever language you're

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,040
using

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,840
so

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,079
you definitely want to

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,119
use

48
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,880
one of those functions instead of trying

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,600
to create your own parsing because

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
um

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,920
and create like a block list

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,360
of uh

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,240
like

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
various uh

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,000
like uh characters or or sub strings

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,720
that uh refer to like some form of

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,239
objection

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,760
because it's

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,080
it's it's a fun game to try and uh beat

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
the block list and

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
get it

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,000
so uh this is one of the factors that

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,120
uh

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
you know

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,680
it contributes

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
oh sorry one of the factors that

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,840
contributes to insecure design

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,519
is the lack of business risk profiling

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,560
inherent

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,200
in a software system being developed

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,280
and thus

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
the failure to determine what level of

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,599
security is required

74
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,200
insecure design

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
is really broad

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
and represents different weaknesses

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
expressed as missing or ineffective

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
control design but this is very vague

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
and you can't really test this

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
right but the general idea is that

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,760
insecure design can't be fixed by

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,800
perfect

83
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,040
implementation

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
whereas

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,599
secure design can still have

86
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,679
issues uh vulnerabilities um

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,440
but insecure design isn't designed to

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
defend against specific attacks so you

89
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
can still have problems with it with a

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,319
secure design application but um it's

91
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,920
just something you have to

92
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,720
do

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,959
um

94
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,519
so the oauth.10 is good to check your

95
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,280
app for

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,799
but uh

97
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,360
really you want to use the af av

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,720
asbs

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,599
os asps

100
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,080
so number five security misconfiguration

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,560
uh application might be vulnerable if

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,239
uh default accounts and their passwords

103
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,959
are still enabled and unchanged uh

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,120
that's uh

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,840
terribly common um unnecessary features

106
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
are enabled or installed

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,159
um like just the other day one of my

108
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,640
clients it's like why is rdp open on

109
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,480
every workstation um when you know that

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,160
that's that's not that's not necessary

111
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
like uh

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,959
no one

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,120
and it'll just be open all the time uh

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
that the portal just be open for uh when

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,479
you're on a

116
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,000
coffee shop like you could just try and

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,120
connect to your computer

118
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
software is out of date or vulnerable

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,479
this is really hard to

120
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,560
to like that's one of the best things

121
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,120
you can do as an individual right

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
is every time you have an update patch

123
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
it immediately but when it comes to

124
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,400
complex uh infrastructure uh and

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,520
patching

126
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,600
caching is its own specific problem like

127
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
vulnerability management and uh

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
and patching

129
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
because there's so many

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
uh you know nested dependencies and

131
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
whatnot uh

132
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,160
the

133
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,639
you know even with for upgraded systems

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,199
uh you know

135
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,440
features are disabled or uh not

136
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,199
configured securely you know

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,680
it's it's really unfair you know uh the

138
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,520
offensive guys have to find one problem

139
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,320
and everyone else has to

140
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
have no issues at all

141
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
uh

142
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,240
one and one another common uh issue is

143
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,919
error handling reveals overly

144
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,960
informative messages to users you can

145
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,560
you know when you log in

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,600
uh

147
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,199
when you try to

148
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,280
you know get into someone else's account

149
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,240
uh you can see oh this email

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,039
uh exists it's like can i reset this

151
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,199
this email does it tell me uh this

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,960
account exists or doesn't it or does it

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,800
is it does it have a vape message that

154
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,199
says if this account exists then the

155
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,039
reset email was sent like that sort of

156
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,199
thing

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,039
vulnerable outdated components that's uh

158
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,039
sort of an element of

159
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,520
previously described uh

160
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,600
if it's vulnerable and supported or out

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
of date

162
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,680
um definitely want to

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,840
keep everything up to date

164
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,960
for equifax that breach happened because

165
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,639
apache struts

166
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,199
a server wasn't updated

167
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,600
the patch was released

168
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,919
and within three days of the patch being

169
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,960
released and remaining unpatched uh

170
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
attackers got in found a configuration

171
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,680
file escalated privileges um

172
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,199
and uh

173
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,400
owned everything

174
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,039
uh so

175
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,520
uh it's really it's really its own um

176
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,880
organizational

177
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,199
processed issue of how you actually keep

178
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,560
everything

179
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
updated in timely fashion um but there's

180
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
a lot of solutions out there for doing

181
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,840
that

182
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,080
one one of the recent talks was about a

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,520
software uh bill of materials or s-bomb

184
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,560
which is required for

185
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,319
creating software for the government in

186
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,120
a lot of cases i think all cases now um

187
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,680
and you like that requires you to

188
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,759
actually list all of the

189
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,479
uh components in your software every

190
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,479
every dependency like every library

191
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,160
everything you're importing i mean you

192
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
don't have to show like internal uh

193
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
information but you uh

194
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
like internal libraries that you've

195
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,479
developed but like everything external

196
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,440
so in every version so that uh of every

197
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
component so

198
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,680
it's very easy to check oh this new this

199
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
new exploit came out are we vulnerable

200
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
to this uh

201
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
this uh library was

202
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,639
uh

203
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,840
uh co-opted by

204
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,599
uh some malicious actor

205
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,160
um and the updates went out or what have

206
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,720
you you know exactly what version

207
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,360
um of your applications are vulnerable

208
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,879
to these issues if you keep version

209
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,479
control of your software bill materials

210
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,080
identification and authentication

211
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
failures

212
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,639
confirmation of the user's identity

213
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,440
authentication and session management

214
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,520
is very important

215
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,440
there may be weaknesses in the

216
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
application

217
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,879
if it permits brute force or other

218
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,039
automated attacks like

219
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,479
are you actually locking people out

220
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,160
after five attempts or three attempts um

221
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
are they are you tracking

222
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,479
how often and where these attempts are

223
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,840
coming from like

224
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
um do you know exactly where your user

225
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,440
is supposed to be like there's all sorts

226
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,958
of things that

227
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,200
can help you

228
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,519
keep it safe

229
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,360
and prevent people from not coming in

230
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,399
that

231
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,039
aren't supposed to so

232
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,120
another issue is uh

233
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,760
passwords um the

234
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,120
you know you don't want default

235
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,640
passwords you don't want insecure

236
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,920
passwords basically every application

237
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
requires you to have good passwords but

238
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,240
at the same time they say exactly what

239
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
is in the secret

240
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
sauce right it's like you have at least

241
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,519
one character

242
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,120
that's capital you have at least one

243
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,920
number you have one at least one symbol

244
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,720
um

245
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
and basically from all the password

246
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,160
breaches

247
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
uh

248
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,640
all the uh statistical analysis on all

249
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,800
of the passwords that are uh out there

250
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,040
is we very clearly see that there are

251
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,560
patterns for how humans at least that

252
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
are creating passwords english

253
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,680
uh

254
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
passwords uh or english speaking uh

255
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,320
what happens is like if it requires a

256
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
number and a

257
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,560
symbol they put those at the end what's

258
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
the easiest thing one exclamation point

259
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,200
so uh

260
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
you would think that like well the

261
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,880
longer the password is the harder it is

262
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,680
to crack right so the longer longer it

263
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,440
takes to try and

264
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,880
brute force it

265
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,680
uh

266
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
so you really want as long a password as

267
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,519
possible right but

268
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,880
uh

269
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,519
but you still will know potentially the

270
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,800
last two

271
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,120
characters so if it requires an eight

272
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,519
character password you know maybe it's

273
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,320
really only six characters because

274
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,600
you'll you'll know certain things and

275
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
people can also look and features for

276
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,120
associated accounts

277
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
um and

278
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,000
uh

279
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,839
use that sort of information of how a

280
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,200
previous password you used you used to

281
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,399
um

282
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,959
create better guesses like uh there's

283
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,839
there's one uh i think spectrum was uh

284
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,920
is a telecom

285
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,000
uh that their all their routers used to

286
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,800
be

287
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,120
have the same format for their password

288
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
uh which was

289
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
like a

290
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,519
a color

291
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,279
an animal and then a number

292
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,600
and you could create that word list

293
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,440
fairly easily

294
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,640
and crack any any router in like

295
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,279
15 seconds

296
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,320
anyway that's my uh

297
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,839
myself and password um

298
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,240
there's all kinds of issues with uh

299
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,519
knowledge based answers like

300
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,760
all these all these things of

301
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,560
verification you know what you are

302
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,880
what you know and what you have like

303
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,760
these things that you know are uh

304
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,560
essentially passwords but

305
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,720
so much of those questions

306
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,399
answers is already public knowledge like

307
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,920
you can look up what high school you

308
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,360
went to with just open source

309
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,120
intelligence you can look up what street

310
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,720
you grew up on

311
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,800
potentially like

312
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,440
all sorts of things like

313
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,519
and really the best the best advice is

314
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,360
just using um

315
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,680
fake answers to all those things so that

316
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,399
uh even if those answers get leaked

317
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,760
um

318
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,079
you're not you're not exposing anything

319
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,120
uh

320
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,040
the last thing i'm going to say is does

321
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,200
not correctly invalidate session ids

322
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,639
if you supposedly log out at a time that

323
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,120
that session id shouldn't keep existing

324
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,920
um

325
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,519
and that's uh

326
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,279
that's a problem for uh

327
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,959
you people can steal your session

328
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,320
session hijacking and uh

329
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,440
if those

330
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,240
if those controls aren't um in place to

331
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,079
destroy that effectively

332
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,240
uh second to last uh software or

333
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,480
software and data integrity failures

334
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
basically code and infrastructure that

335
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,800
doesn't uh protect against integrity

336
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,519
violations uh where an application

337
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,440
relies on plug-ins libraries or modules

338
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,120
from untrusted sources

339
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,959
uh repositories and content delivery

340
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,000
networks

341
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,200
um

342
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,120
an example uh

343
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
which i brought up slightly before an

344
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
auto updating app can update without

345
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
sufficient integrity verification and

346
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
apply malicious changes to a previously

347
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,519
trusted application so uh your library

348
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,200
uh could be uh

349
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,399
you know um

350
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,800
like open source can be compromised you

351
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,120
know someone can add something that uh

352
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,880
and people miss the uh

353
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,040
the backdoor or what have you and uh it

354
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,120
gets pushed out to every single person

355
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040
using it

356
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,000
and

357
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
that's an issue

358
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,800
so

359
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,560
actually second to last penultimate

360
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
security logging and monitoring failures

361
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,240
without logging and monitoring there can

362
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,560
be no detections

363
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,440
and

364
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,360
that's a problem if you want to actually

365
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
like know what's happening so threat

366
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
detection and response you can't respond

367
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,240
if you don't know it's there um you need

368
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,760
auditable events

369
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,720
such as logins scale logins transactions

370
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,399
you need everything to be logged and

371
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,480
that's sort of the direction that uh

372
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,000
security operations is going is you know

373
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
log everything get really fat pipes to

374
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,959
just handle like all the logs coming

375
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,839
from every single uh source like your

376
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,760
firewall every host-based firewall

377
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,240
every workstation every server every

378
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,880
everything

379
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,440
uh warnings and errors generate no in a

380
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,839
cut inadequate or unclear log messages

381
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,040
like you can't

382
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,120
like i said you can't know um what you

383
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,000
don't

384
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,160
what you don't know um and if you don't

385
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,519
get logs

386
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,440
you can't uh do anything but the the

387
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,240
other uh so monitoring just reinforcing

388
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,199
is the

389
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,120
is core so you have to log everything

390
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
but if you're not actually looking at it

391
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,920
uh

392
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,279
you know what's gonna happen like one of

393
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,560
my one of the clients i i pen tested

394
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,680
uh

395
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,160
they had a honeypot user but no one was

396
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,839
actually monitoring it

397
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,360
so

398
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
so like what what's the point of having

399
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,399
canaries or or uh honeypots if you're

400
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,880
not actually triggering alerts when

401
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
those things are detected uh

402
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,600
so

403
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,040
when those things happen when

404
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,880
exploitation happens

405
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,839
uh the other uh core element is logs are

406
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,760
only stored locally you need to have

407
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,600
um like a cloud solution or some some

408
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,160
way to get the logs from individual

409
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,720
devices or the the application server

410
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,120
somewhere else so that those logs can't

411
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,959
be immediately compromised at least they

412
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,880
just have to be backed up but uh you

413
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,839
want to have as many

414
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,199
redundancy um

415
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,440
because also if there's an investigation

416
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,480
if there's a

417
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,360
real incident um you need to provide uh

418
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,959
this sort of stuff and show that you've

419
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,399
done your due diligence and that you're

420
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
complying for uh various regulations

421
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,079
depending on who you do business with

422
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,480
centralized logging is pretty uh

423
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,079
pretty uh core to

424
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,260
modern security operations um

425
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,600
[Music]

426
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,880
uh this is more a part of uh

427
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,279
like tuning the out of

428
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,920
alerting so if you're you know if your

429
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,639
security team is getting alerts

430
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,720
you know they're getting uh

431
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,160
100

432
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,839
events a day of like

433
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,759
uh 100 isn't that much but like a

434
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,279
hundred of the same

435
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,680
same alert triggering uh they're just

436
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,519
and they're all false positives when

437
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,639
there's actually a positive uh like they

438
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,839
probably

439
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,000
like won't look at it they won't they'll

440
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
probably assume it's false right so you

441
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,199
want to have

442
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,320
a as

443
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,199
as explicit messages as you can

444
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,560
um

445
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,360
or and as accurate because like there's

446
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,279
only so many things you can look at a

447
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,120
day you won't you only have so many

448
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,199
analysts and you only so many eyes on

449
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,360
the screen

450
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,079
so uh

451
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
you have to alert um

452
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,399
you have to tune your alerting process

453
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,720
and also uh like if you don't actually

454
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
have the

455
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
the uh

456
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
process in place you don't have a

457
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,279
playbook for what you do when something

458
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,240
happens

459
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,959
like

460
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,560
uh

461
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,320
you know that's

462
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,839
then you're kind of like oh my god

463
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,279
there's a hacker

464
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,880
on the server or

465
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,160
what have you and you don't know you

466
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
don't have like you have to learn

467
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,120
everything like on the fly and it's a

468
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,800
lot more stressful than like we know

469
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,480
exactly what we're going to do so i mean

470
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,560
a lot of cases in an organization they

471
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,959
won't have a specific issue so like oh

472
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,039
all the executives just made a big deal

473
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:07,919
with

474
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,880
some uh middle eastern client you know

475
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,640
and they're all going to fly out to

476
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,160
that country and like well do we want to

477
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,079
have any more uh

478
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,760
like like what do we do in this case

479
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,839
like even i mean this is this is not a

480
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,359
web application but

481
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,600
when you have uh

482
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,840
like

483
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,120
uh how do you how do you build out a

484
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,039
program for what you're what you do when

485
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,200
your employees travel like

486
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,320
um

487
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,240
so you don't have to

488
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,400
or like here's some malware what are we

489
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,679
gonna do when

490
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,679
the the application server is

491
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,000
attached so um

492
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
actually building that out having even

493
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,679
if you haven't done it yourself

494
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,720
uh having the playbook there is a lot

495
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,799
more comforting because you know exactly

496
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,559
where to look and you can update it as

497
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,799
needed of course but uh like uh

498
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,400
it definitely uh reduces the stress um

499
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,520
when it happens uh so this is this is

500
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,919
sort of the last element uh if you're if

501
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,840
you're being tested if you're being

502
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,240
scanned if you're being

503
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,480
you know

504
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,280
like

505
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,600
someone is actively hacking you like

506
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,360
you want to know that so

507
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,080
so like having penetration tests uh even

508
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,919
just running uh a scanner um

509
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,200
can uh

510
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,880
let you know uh

511
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,640
are you detecting things and uh

512
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,600
and you cannot modify your your uh

513
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
alerts on that

514
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,120
uh lastly server side request forgery

515
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,559
this is new this year uh on the top 10.

516
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,320
uh it's basically whenever an

517
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
application is fetching a remote

518
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,200
resource

519
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,200
uh and you don't validate the url

520
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,520
so this can happen

521
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,840
um

522
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,600
a lot like you can you can send a very

523
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
specific request and

524
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,400
get a lot of unexpected

525
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,799
results

526
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,000
and

527
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,360
ssrf is increasing

528
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,880
there's so many uh

529
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,120
cloud services and architecture is

530
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,679
becoming more complex uh

531
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,600
the uh

532
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,039
it's really hard to keep track of

533
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,799
server-side issues so this is this is

534
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,880
another thing that's hard to explicitly

535
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,559
uh test i'll cover all your bases but um

536
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
it's definitely very important so now

537
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,160
let's actually do things uh

538
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,120
so

539
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,000
uh hopefully you have uh signed up for

540
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,120
the

541
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,760
avatar platform i'm just to show their

542
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,480
website real quick

543
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,799
the idea is security awareness which is

544
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,720
the point of the top 10 initially

545
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,720
provide continuous training for

546
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,919
developers

547
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:04,840
and

548
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
uh basically support your security

549
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,240
culture

550
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,280
so

551
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,600
has everyone in the room at least uh

552
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,158
logged in

553
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,880
it won't let you log in

554
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,840
uh not on your phone it won't no but i'm

555
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,039
very sorry oh really

556
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,400
uh the the invite link is in the uh

557
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,039
the meetup

558
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,000
or do you want us to log into uh

559
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,760
the avatar

560
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,720
yeah

561
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,320
okay thank you so uh

562
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,240
so here's the invite link there's only

563
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,679
99 seats so

564
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,039
uh that might be an issue but

565
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,840
so like actually uh when i start with it

566
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,120
um uh can you explain about uh

567
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,520
how can i go and take the exercises

568
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,559
uh yeah i'll be explaining the platform

569
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,200
uh shortly but uh what was your question

570
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
thank you

571
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,000
oh um

572
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,880
so it's in the oauth

573
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,520
a lost version of this i guess

574
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,520
okay

575
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,360
okay uh can you

576
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,600
can uh

577
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,159
i guess i can just post this in the uh

578
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,159
zoom

579
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,480
i actually

580
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,440
zoom

581
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,559
but i already have one

582
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,960
so there's 15 people that have joined

583
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,360
the team

584
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
so far

585
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,159
chat

586
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,039
all right thank you

587
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,640
is everyone on the uh oh

588
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
is everyone uh on zoom uh

589
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,240
logged in i guess

590
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,960
i can wait for chung

591
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,840
are you still typing

592
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,679
uh

593
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,240
i believe you can get back to it um

594
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,120
did you did you complete one already the

595
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,720
uh

596
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,240
yeah yeah uh the so the uh

597
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,039
uh

598
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,480
so um

599
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,760
it's a it's a secure code

600
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,200
learning platform it's a training

601
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,440
platform for developers and also just

602
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,840
for for anyone for security awareness so

603
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
i'm just let me know

604
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,959
sorry to rush it

605
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,000
so there's all these different learning

606
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,080
paths for any uh

607
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,279
for all kinds of uh

608
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,880
whatever you're looking to get better at

609
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,039
so there's like currently secured back

610
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,120
end development in python secure full

611
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,919
stack development devsec cops

612
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,640
uh back-end and c-sharp that kind of are

613
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,360
you showing a screen actually zac uh it

614
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,520
showing your meetup screen are you

615
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,679
trying to explain with avatar

616
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,080
yeah uh

617
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
i'm not showing it yet

618
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,440
okay okay

619
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,440
okay

620
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,360
so

621
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,200
so there's a lot of different uh

622
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,440
learning paths so you can

623
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,320
whatever you want to focus on uh you can

624
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,039
uh get better at so python flask you

625
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,520
know uh you can uh

626
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,360
join any of these things i'm the leader

627
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,159
so

628
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,840
i can assign any of these things to you

629
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,520
but right now uh i just assigned uh

630
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,840
a few uh modules of

631
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,320
so here's the uh

632
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,399
here are the different um

633
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,240
modules i assigned for today so these

634
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,200
are all uh owasp related there's the

635
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,399
onboarding module which uh we'll go

636
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,520
through just to

637
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,520
learn about the platform so

638
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,039
um i believe

639
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,080
it's already a sign but uh here's the

640
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,320
here's how tutorials work um

641
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,320
basically there's two types of uh

642
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,919
challenges or there's two types of

643
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,320
exercises there's tutorials and then

644
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,640
there's challenges so challenges are

645
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,760
more like ctf you don't actually get any

646
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,200
uh

647
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,360
uh they don't give you the answer um

648
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,720
tutorial however uh does is like a fully

649
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,320
guided exercise so they explain that

650
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,399
here you have to solve these by yourself

651
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,320
uh and submit a flag

652
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,279
um but there are hints

653
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,080
so

654
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,960
i'm just gonna start this what happens

655
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,760
is

656
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,000
it opens a docker container here's the

657
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,159
uh

658
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,799
you click on the web service

659
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,000
and you can check solution so this is

660
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,559
once you've done the tasks it can verify

661
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,480
that you've uh you've completed through

662
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,960
unit tests on the back end so

663
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,000
i'm just going to uh

664
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,279
so here's their netflix here's the url

665
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,080
which

666
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,120
uh

667
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,679
sometimes i forget right uh

668
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,640
which one but um here on the side is the

669
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,799
the framework for uh

670
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,799
basically

671
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,480
uh

672
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,240
it'll tell you uh

673
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,559
generally the direction to take if uh if

674
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,120
you don't know on the side there's uh

675
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,279
different uh examples so here's just the

676
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,679
website they generally show you just the

677
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,360
one that you uh

678
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,000
specifically need for that exercise but

679
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,080
here is the

680
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
in this case it's a

681
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,039
text file but uh you can also it can

682
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,279
also show you code and then here you

683
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,360
have access to the terminal

684
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,240
uh that's running this web service and

685
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,600
the console

686
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,200
in case you're printing you're printing

687
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,159
anything to the console on the site so

688
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,640
right now

689
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,799
we're just gonna see uh

690
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,279
or it just says click one of the links

691
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,159
um

692
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,120
here we're gonna log in

693
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,120
so we're gonna

694
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,559
yeah so the

695
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,039
we're gonna try to probably uh

696
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,640
break in here

697
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,880
um

698
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,880
but uh well actually i think this is

699
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,080
just a tutorial example so hello world

700
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,720
i'm gonna say hello

701
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,600
uh hello

702
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,360
oh wasp

703
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,480
attackers

704
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,760
uh and you can see here's the console

705
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,080
we're gonna see what's actually in this

706
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,960
folder with ls list content

707
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,799
and we can

708
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,399
cat

709
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,480
or concatenate print

710
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,320
uh example.txt

711
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,760
uh

712
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,679
here we see

713
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,559
uh

714
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,320
what was changed in this file is

715
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,720
automatically updated on the server

716
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,640
and uh we can see the

717
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,120
effect of that change by checking the

718
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,600
server so uh

719
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,440
you can hit check solution

720
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,600
um to

721
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,640
uh finish it you do need to like close

722
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,559
this this uh

723
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,080
app this page to uh

724
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,360
like once you're done it doesn't like

725
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,760
tell you you're done so you have to come

726
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,679
back it was the check solution

727
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,679
got it you got it um so you can rate it

728
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,840
uh

729
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,240
and uh

730
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,799
i'm confident i'm fully confident

731
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,640
that i could do this again

732
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,399
so here's a

733
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,000
second one

734
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,799
uh this is an actual uh broken object

735
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,440
level authorization bola or insecure

736
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,240
direct object reference

737
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,480
uh this is an example of the first

738
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,279
number one on os top 10 or 2021 broken

739
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,919
access control so uh here's a

740
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,240
recommended reading for all of these

741
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,880
examples i will say uh

742
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,360
rtfm you should read everything they

743
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,000
give you uh um before but i will of

744
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,440
course answer any questions that anyone

745
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,320
has uh and don't be afraid to ask your

746
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,399
neighbor as well um everyone has

747
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,640
different uh skill sets so

748
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,039
um and we're all here to learn so we're

749
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,960
just going to uh

750
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
see what

751
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,240
this

752
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,039
okay so here

753
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,240
broken access control um

754
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,679
you ever want to know who you're working

755
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,360
with feel free to register and check the

756
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,919
profile of anyone so let's uh let's do

757
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:30,720
that

758
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,960
um

759
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,399
test test

760
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,640
username not available

761
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,640
test

762
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,039
and we save that password so now we're

763
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,559
online

764
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,200
uh logged in and they'll show you online

765
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,559
users

766
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,679
um

767
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,799
noah francesco kate so

768
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,559
let's see for profile

769
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,159
they tell you the id some of the stuff

770
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:08,880
is

771
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,640
exposed

772
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,159
in

773
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,480
cookies sometimes

774
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,399
it usually doesn't tell you explicitly

775
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,799
on the page

776
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,799
what the id

777
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,240
for any user is

778
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,080
but uh so kate is eight bob

779
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,240
two

780
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,240
looks like uh the the users change every

781
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,440
uh

782
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,240
every time but in the uh the side here

783
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
they uh

784
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,559
they asked is it possible to load user

785
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,519
profiles

786
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,519
knowing only their ids

787
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,279
so how would we uh

788
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,080
how would we uh

789
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,919
how would we check that

790
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,760
or like is there anything you notice on

791
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,200
this page

792
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,640
um for

793
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,080
uh

794
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,519
how we're selecting

795
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,880
how this profile is selected

796
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,919
yes

797
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,640
so here we can see in this web service

798
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,480
it's selected

799
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,839
um we can we can check the user by uh id

800
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,839
so who's who's won

801
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,040
is there anyone

802
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,918
on

803
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,159
is there a zero

804
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,399
doesn't exist um is there

805
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,239
i believe they ask for 19

806
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,520
admin

807
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,759
yeah

808
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,359
administer you made a user

809
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,079
uh admin user instagram

810
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,000
yeah try admin

811
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,119
yeah

812
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,079
so i assume that uh

813
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,839
the since this is uh the ids are an

814
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,599
integer

815
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,639
that uh you know potentially we could

816
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,040
see if uh different things break it you

817
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,079
know

818
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:56,879
but

819
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,118
uh

820
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,800
uh generally i would assume

821
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,920
uh

822
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,240
like admin i would assume maybe that's

823
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,119
user zero but that doesn't uh exist in

824
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,960
this exercise but

825
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,280
um they say what if we happen to change

826
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
the number in the url to 19

827
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,839
easy

828
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,000
get here profiles private

829
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,800
but

830
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,320
if only there was another page that

831
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,160
shows a user's username like a

832
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,240
vulnerable profile page

833
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,119
so if we go to our profile we see what

834
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,640
id we are we see our name

835
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,440
um but what do we see in the url

836
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,119
profile id

837
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,240
equals 21.

838
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,400
so

839
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
let's see can we see another user's

840
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,000
profile

841
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,480
yes we can

842
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,640
so

843
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,079
for some reason he uh

844
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,400
he posted his address that's probably

845
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,240
not his address and a credit card but uh

846
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,400
why an attacker would make

847
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,720
i mean you would make an uh an account

848
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,280
to sort of go on the happy path right uh

849
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,359
see what sort of things you can see uh

850
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,200
when you're testing an application what

851
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,040
are like the normal actions you can take

852
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,200
as a user you can sort of map the entire

853
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,640
site um and then you can start looking

854
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,240
for stuff like this can you break the

855
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,880
profile can you when you're uploading uh

856
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,640
your profile photo is there any way you

857
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,560
can

858
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,760
you know

859
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,960
upload a

860
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,560
reverse shell

861
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,400
into the image field because you can uh

862
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,119
you know you can just

863
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,599
you know preface a

864
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,040
script with uh bmp

865
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,160
or

866
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,760
and then that

867
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,640
it will be read as a an image file but

868
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,440
actually it's just a script

869
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,119
that when it gets loaded from the server

870
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,440
it can open reverse shell for example

871
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,760
so here we see the actual

872
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,000
code

873
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,040
which is

874
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,599
you're always authorized it looks like

875
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,520
on your profile

876
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,560
so current user is an integer

877
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,440
um

878
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
these are type hints which is nice in

879
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,599
python 3. but

880
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,760
it's not required and it doesn't i don't

881
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,760
think it actually stops you from putting

882
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
in

883
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,400
variable type in there but uh basically

884
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
uh

885
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,320
what do we want to check like what do we

886
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,520
want to do

887
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,119
who do we actually want to see here we

888
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,320
only want

889
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,000
the current user

890
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,520
um

891
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,960
to access a profile if it's uh the same

892
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,480
id as the profile id as the user id so

893
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,000
what you can do is

894
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,839
if current id equals equals id

895
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,400
uh return true else or turn false

896
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,880
or you can just say

897
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,960
return

898
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,880
uh current user

899
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,320
equals equals

900
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,599
id

901
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,200
because

902
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,040
if this this

903
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,520
state this statement will be evaluated

904
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,520
to true if the user is

905
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,079
correct and it'll evaluate to false if

906
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,920
it's a different user

907
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,400
and then we can hit deploy

908
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,480
and uh now when we try and load this

909
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,359
page

910
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,960
uh there's an error

911
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,800
so we're not uh we're not allowed so

912
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,839
this is

913
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,520
you know this is a code snippet of

914
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,759
what's going on in the background but um

915
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,680
so this is uh just check this

916
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,200
yeah

917
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,760
it works

918
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,119
liz

919
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,200
uh your application shouldn't rely on

920
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
security by obscurity

921
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,560
um you shouldn't uh deny it by default

922
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,800
rather than allow by default

923
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,040
um

924
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,720
make sure uh don't even think about

925
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,240
random user ids as a prevention

926
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,160
mechanism because even with an extremely

927
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,560
long

928
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,400
alphanumeric string or something as your

929
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,720
id that can still be uh that can still

930
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,760
be guessed

931
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,000
um

932
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,839
but definitely not just plain editors

933
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,680
so uh that's the end of this tutorial

934
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,640
and we can exit here check solution

935
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,119
check solution

936
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,760
and uh

937
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,680
let's go um

938
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,920
so here's here's the uh here's a

939
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,880
challenge

940
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,040
uh introduction to challenges

941
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,000
so

942
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,200
this is

943
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,440
this is one that'll give you hints but

944
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,520
you have to uh

945
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,160
submit a hidden

946
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,680
string that you'll find

947
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,760
and you'll know it when you see it so

948
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,839
let's start this exercise there are two

949
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,359
readings

950
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,599
um

951
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,320
so definitely take take advantage of

952
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,960
that

953
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
but uh i'm just going to show this and

954
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,320
uh let someone tell me why

955
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,760
what the first place they would look for

956
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,560
trying to break into this

957
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,359
yeah dp-link archer c7 so

958
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,160
what device is this actually um this is

959
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,440
a like a standard password issue

960
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,720
on routers

961
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,079
like i mentioned

962
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,920
uh spectrum routers at one point

963
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,520
all kinds of routers people generally

964
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,480
don't change uh the default password and

965
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,560
you can just look that up so

966
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,560
uh i mean we can look up wire guide

967
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,160
um

968
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,920
potentially it's uh it's fake uh let's

969
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,640
look up uh tp link

970
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,160
archer c7

971
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,319
so this is a standard

972
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,400
router

973
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,920
[Music]

974
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,280
actually real

975
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,160
and let's just look up default

976
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,640
password

977
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,640
so this is this is a

978
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,400
pretty common um

979
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,680
that uh you know if you forget

980
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,119
that if someone forgets uh

981
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,079
they want to be able to change it but

982
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,520
you know this is like

983
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
a very simple issue to fix

984
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,040
but we see here are a few uh

985
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,599
answers probably the admin admin you

986
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,079
probably could have guessed that as well

987
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,560
but uh

988
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,800
yeah so that lets us in and here's our

989
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
flag congratulations

990
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,040
um

991
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,960
so this is all you knows

992
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,319
but

993
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,800
you can say you know if we're logging in

994
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,280
instead we can say admin and then quote

995
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,000
and then that will close you know

996
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,839
that'll uh

997
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,280
include just

998
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,680
or it'll end the the uh

999
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,280
the very like the variable and you can

1000
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
comment out the rest of the line

1001
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,920
and uh

1002
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
that's like the most common way in but

1003
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,359
there's a there's like a lot of

1004
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,079
different um like payloads all the

1005
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,359
things

1006
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,880
is a classic

1007
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,880
commonly used

1008
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,720
cheat sheet for this sort of thing

1009
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,920
so there's all these different types of

1010
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,920
databases you potentially don't know

1011
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,599
what you're looking at what type of

1012
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,440
database so there's different ways to

1013
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,359
check which one you're which one you're

1014
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,240
in

1015
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,319
um

1016
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,760
so here's like the

1017
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,520
database management system uh

1018
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,720
identification you can uh enter specific

1019
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,480
things and see what kind of results you

1020
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,280
get

1021
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,160
um the

1022
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,839
i'm looking for the actual

1023
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,480
here's uh here's the classic off bypass

1024
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,800
uh list so you can just try

1025
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,280
this entire list of potential

1026
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,800
uh bypasses and if they're using a block

1027
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,359
list instead of an uh

1028
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,599
like paired statements or something you

1029
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,599
can potentially bypass all kinds of uh

1030
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,480
auth

1031
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,560
um

1032
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,160
and

1033
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,640
you can hide uh you can hide uh your

1034
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,119
characters if they're they're blocking

1035
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,359
uh specific characters you can you can

1036
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,720
uh they can code it uh within sql so

1037
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,079
here's uh

1038
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,839
but what we're doing right now is

1039
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,680
we can also comment out everything after

1040
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,200
the row id right that's what i was

1041
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,200
showing um

1042
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,880
try to call the syntax error to prove

1043
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,400
the application is vulnerable you will

1044
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,200
see the message in the logs file

1045
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,160
so they actually pre-type this for you

1046
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,920
we're curling

1047
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,079
one two seven zero zero one which is

1048
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,240
localhost

1049
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,359
is running from the server on port uh

1050
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,480
one one one one

1051
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
we're curling the index so that's just

1052
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,440
uh

1053
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,880
the main page

1054
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,400
um where the dash h is for header um

1055
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,160
connection keep alive

1056
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,079
content type

1057
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,839
publication

1058
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,960
performance

1059
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,000
and then we're adding this cookie

1060
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,400
and uh

1061
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,200
here's the actual data that we're

1062
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,400
sending

1063
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,800
console equals one delete id equals five

1064
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,160
so here's the actual uh

1065
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,359
beautiful soup of html we get um

1066
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,000
that's that's the content of this actual

1067
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,520
page so

1068
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,079
that'll be the same as

1069
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,520
uh you pick source

1070
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,359
or actually not not the page source the

1071
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,359
uh expect here

1072
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,079
this specific part of it

1073
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,640
but uh we can't uh

1074
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,240
we don't have enough space on this uh

1075
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,040
on the window so um

1076
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,000
we see here's a new log coming in we

1077
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,920
tried to delete

1078
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,160
row id5 again

1079
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,839
uh here's the cookie

1080
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,799
it's the same thing

1081
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,839
so we can delete anything we want now

1082
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,119
uh

1083
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,839
we can delete

1084
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,920
or

1085
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,040
you know

1086
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,720
uh

1087
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,640
as long as we uh

1088
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,759
change what the idea is

1089
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,720
so now we uh

1090
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,400
we get this out this other message you

1091
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,839
can only delete your own items

1092
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,240
so what other things would we want to do

1093
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,240
here

1094
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,359
you can try and add something for the uh

1095
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,760
what did we get last time was there

1096
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,640
anything generated here

1097
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,720
maybe

1098
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,680
so how do we want to remove this fake

1099
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,680
item

1100
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,359
um

1101
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,680
so

1102
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,559
yeah you can't go down into the linux uh

1103
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,640
terminal and put remove

1104
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,000
i mean yeah i don't think this is the

1105
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,680
one of the exercises

1106
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,799
yeah probably not memory

1107
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,640
so i picked a bad example

1108
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,599
i mean potentially it's that it's the

1109
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,240
same issue

1110
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,240
the other the other tutorial had hints

1111
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,640
but i'm not seeing him on this one

1112
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,760
yeah this is

1113
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,400
this might be a challenge

1114
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,440
i think it says uh

1115
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,359
i mean potentially this session could be

1116
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,359
bad

1117
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,160
so

1118
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,839
you can only delete your own items is

1119
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,520
there a way that we can change what our

1120
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,839
user id is in this request

1121
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,319
so i think it's probably just we need to

1122
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,960
log in as the

1123
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,280
that user

1124
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,920
do we have any information about this

1125
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,599
user

1126
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,079
oh added by user id 19.

1127
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,760
we have the actual

1128
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,760
url

1129
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,720
you just logging in as admin and see if

1130
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,759
you can do anything from there

1131
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,680
potentially we can

1132
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,280
delete it from here right the the actual

1133
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,440
uh delete request right when we add

1134
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,040
something and then delete it

1135
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,960
we delete this

1136
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,160
so maybe we want to say

1137
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,319
can we uh

1138
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,680
and then that the notes there

1139
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,079
says that i'm sure you read it there but

1140
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,480
it says

1141
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,480
add and then remove a new item to

1142
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,400
generate the valid session cookie after

1143
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,559
that you can copy it from the log file

1144
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:19,839
in the terminal

1145
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,160
yeah that's what that's what we were

1146
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,118
doing before right

1147
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,960
i

1148
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,000
thought so but it's still there you know

1149
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,599
and all the other tutorials like give

1150
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,280
you a new little

1151
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,079
thing

1152
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,040
when you finish that one

1153
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,800
and it does say like remove it doesn't

1154
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,000
say delete i don't know sorry

1155
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,559
it's all good

1156
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,240
i mean we i mean supposedly are we not

1157
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,599
we're not admin

1158
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,760
but

1159
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,160
i can try a bunch of these uh

1160
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,399
you know

1161
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,440
injections does anyone else have ideas

1162
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,480
or manage to crack it

1163
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,078
i'm pretty sure

1164
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,720
bunch of new people welcome

1165
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,480
yeah

1166
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,240
maybe i should move on to something else

1167
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,839
what challenge are you on

1168
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,920
oh let's see what they i mean they just

1169
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,480
link us to this right

1170
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,920
yeah i looked through that and couldn't

1171
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,040
figure it out

1172
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,319
they showed the examples but

1173
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,760
i guess i'm wondering if it's

1174
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,160
not adding it actually in there

1175
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,720
but i don't want to miss direct to

1176
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,280
so can we actually add

1177
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,799
what does this do

1178
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,400
that just adds up directly

1179
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,240
well i don't want to waste any more time

1180
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,920
so

1181
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,920
we can do a different one but

1182
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,359
this was supposed to be a tutorial

1183
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,599
so actually how is this workshop we need

1184
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,040
to work on like

1185
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,200
we all solve the one questionnaire

1186
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,680
problem together or uh no you can work

1187
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,440
on whatever one you want i was just

1188
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,640
trying to show off some of the

1189
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,640
okay

1190
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,319
let's do uh

1191
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,119
they have some

1192
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,680
cool uh

1193
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,760
security breach examples as well

1194
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,599
um hi i have a question until when do we

1195
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,760
have access to these exercises

1196
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,359
uh when do you have access to them no um

1197
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:24,799
until when

1198
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,880
um until next week

1199
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,559
on friday

1200
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,319
okay i was we can uh start the actual

1201
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,240
competition

1202
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,479
um

1203
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,640
is there a way to like extend that

1204
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,359
access this is a really neat platform

1205
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:46,558
yeah i was thinking i can ask the uh

1206
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,279
the

1207
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,599
platform owners that would be so cool if

1208
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:53,980
you could

1209
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,000
[Music]

1210
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,440
it's really neat and i don't know if i

1211
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,119
can get all the way

1212
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,240
through

1213
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,359
what i have access to in a week but if

1214
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,760
if not no worries it'd be cool to just

1215
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,720
try thank you

1216
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,040
i mean i'll put this till

1217
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,839
you know

1218
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,640
12 but i think we're uh

1219
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,720
approaching the end of this angle uh

1220
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,240
or not i mean i can put it till 5 pm

1221
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,119
today

1222
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,160
at the end of jesus

1223
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,960
all mixed up

1224
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,680
uh the

1225
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,640
i mean even seven but yeah

1226
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,799
but even but aside from the ctf stuff

1227
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,839
just like the the rest of the

1228
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:42,880
stuff

1229
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,319
uh

1230
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:49,000
the mod you know the modules and whatnot

1231
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,640
shorter ones

1232
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,319
so these all have hints i'll put the

1233
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:12,279
hints on but uh

1234
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,000
and we'll put the uh the long hard one

1235
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,319
then i think there's three in a row that

1236
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,240
i did via

1237
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,879
sadness

1238
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,200
okay

1239
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,839
thank you so much

1240
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,559
well i do want to be able to announce it

1241
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,160
before the end of the day so maybe i'll

1242
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,640
just say so uh

1243
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,040
it's a one

1244
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,400
yeah for some reason as the leader they

1245
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,280
don't keep track of my progress

1246
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,520
we know you're good at this

1247
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,079
supposedly supposedly

1248
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,079
except when everyone's looking which is

1249
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,640
always the case

1250
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,599
jackie

1251
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,280
so click jacking isn't actually that

1252
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,440
common but

1253
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,200
uh today but you know

1254
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,400
it can be a part of more sophisticated

1255
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,440
stuff

1256
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,040
where a user is tricked to click on

1257
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,880
something different from what they

1258
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,839
they're

1259
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:30,400
expecting

1260
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,799
so let's see the attacker creates a page

1261
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,359
that contains a site in a hidden iframe

1262
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,559
where the victim is already logged in

1263
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,160
the victim thinks he's clicking on the

1264
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,319
attacker page however he's clicking in

1265
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:49,160
the invisible iframe in executes

1266
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,839
notify

1267
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:24,480
profile

1268
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:29,000
so we can delete the profile

1269
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,920
so here is

1270
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,319
the click jacket site

1271
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,400
so this is this is a common thing where

1272
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,880
they'll just show you the same page that

1273
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,039
you'd like to log into something that

1274
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:05,119
you're already logged into that's a very

1275
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,119
common thing on like

1276
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,920
facebook exploitation too it's like you

1277
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,520
click on a link that

1278
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,520
was sent to you that was a scam

1279
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,119
and then uh

1280
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,480
then it'll take you to another page that

1281
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,640
looks exactly like facebook tells you to

1282
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,880
log in to see the stuff and then people

1283
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,440
will just do it so uh

1284
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,079
here let's log in again

1285
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,319
but uh

1286
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,520
missing user

1287
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,319
how did that happen

1288
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,079
the user profile has been recreated to

1289
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,319
check the attacker page without hiding

1290
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,480
the iframe

1291
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,400
so let's look at the attacker page

1292
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,439
so there's an opacity issue

1293
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,200
so

1294
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,720
there's an invisible uh

1295
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,039
capacity zero uh this this

1296
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,119
element is a physical

1297
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,520
style

1298
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:39,760
so the reason why click jacking isn't

1299
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,720
as big of an issue

1300
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:46,400
you can prevent it with uh

1301
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,520
simple fixes but

1302
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,599
let's see where's their app

1303
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,440
yes

1304
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,599
so now we just deny the

1305
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:21,160
extra options

1306
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,480
actually

1307
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,520
so there's an invisible iframe right

1308
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,839
that's uh that was placed over it

1309
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,319
and so when you click the link it just

1310
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,839
was actually clicking the delete but

1311
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,400
deleting your account is a very odd

1312
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,839
uh thing to click jack to do

1313
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,839
anyway

1314
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,440
so this is another insecure profile

1315
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,200
access uh

1316
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,078
we could do that one

1317
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,599
let's do a hashing pass or tracking

1318
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,760
so

1319
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,160
for those that don't know hashing is

1320
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,599
like a one-way

1321
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,440
function where encrypting you can

1322
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,839
decrypt it afterward

1323
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:40,319
so generally the only way to figure out

1324
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,079
what the original string was that was

1325
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:43,119
hashed

1326
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:44,960
is to

1327
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,720
run a bunch of different

1328
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,160
strings in

1329
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,920
into the hash function to try and get

1330
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,960
the same hash as the existence

1331
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,960
so

1332
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,160
let's see uh

1333
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,440
we have a zip file

1334
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,960
yeah there's two ways

1335
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,760
right here rainbow tables pre-computed

1336
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,599
hashes you can check those hashes

1337
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:23,039
against what you have

1338
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,640
um brute force

1339
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,119
you can uh

1340
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,119
just try a bunch of passwords and push

1341
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,920
them through the hash

1342
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,520
so md5 is

1343
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,079
not secure but still useful for getting

1344
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,039
files for identifying files or processes

1345
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,520
for malware checking

1346
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,319
python3

1347
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,920
and then

1348
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,280
here's the cache here

1349
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,880
this

1350
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,359
hashing it again

1351
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,479
so

1352
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,880
to prevent needing to uh

1353
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,040
to prevent uh like the rainbow table

1354
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,799
attack you can add salts to your

1355
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:28,080
passwords so that uh

1356
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,799
the hash will be different

1357
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,839
than uh just just uh

1358
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,759
than the actual password so you can't

1359
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,679
just run the uh

1360
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:39,198
the password through the hash to get the

1361
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,000
answer but uh

1362
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,319
but the salt is usually stored locally

1363
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,198
so

1364
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:47,040
it's if they have access to the

1365
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,880
passwords they can see what the salt is

1366
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,880
so this is uh still uh um

1367
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,799
still more effective than just hashing

1368
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:56,880
but um

1369
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,759
it's just one one more step so let's see

1370
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,000
uh you can crack it

1371
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,880
you're just saying hash

1372
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,560
and it should only take slightly longer

1373
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,399
like very very slightly longer because

1374
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:24,158
you're just concatenating

1375
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:24,960
the

1376
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,319
salt to the the hash but uh salt to the

1377
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,640
password but it depends on how it's uh

1378
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,839
actually

1379
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,679
uh implemented like you put it before or

1380
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,399
after in the middle or something but uh

1381
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,158
it has to be done in the same way

1382
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:40,319
because if it's not

1383
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,319
uh you can't verify that

1384
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,000
the password coming in and the password

1385
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,158
that already exists are the same so

1386
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:49,839
let's just uh go through

1387
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,480
raising it might make the login process

1388
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,040
too slow

1389
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,360
but

1390
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,760
but the longer it takes to actually

1391
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,239
compute the hash um the longer it takes

1392
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,040
for someone to crack it right so

1393
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,760
that's the issue with quantum uh

1394
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,120
quantum tracking is uh supposedly right

1395
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,040
we can take the the amount of time the

1396
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,320
amount of uh

1397
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,840
iterations essentially down a lot

1398
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,760
but there is quantum safe photography uh

1399
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:34,960
that exists

1400
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,640
but it just uh takes longer so i mean

1401
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,320
like theoretically

1402
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,560
if we're encrypting or uh hashing

1403
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,719
well

1404
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,280
i guess i mean uh for for encryption

1405
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,760
quantum safe photography but uh for

1406
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,480
for uh hashing like

1407
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,320
potentially you could you could just

1408
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,120
make uh it take a really long time but

1409
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,120
uh quantum computing

1410
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,600
is able to crack it faster i think

1411
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,320
let's see what we have

1412
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:17,920
so this is a hash

1413
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,159
um

1414
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,840
you see these a lot

1415
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,239
but uh

1416
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:27,199
we can look this up on google

1417
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,199
google

1418
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,400
does anyone uh

1419
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,839
know the password of this one

1420
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,000
did you let me in

1421
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,640
um

1422
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,040
yes

1423
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,519
[Music]

1424
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,840
it's not what

1425
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,920
how did you how did you find it

1426
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,960
just google it

1427
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,520
so uh

1428
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:34,080
goddammit thing

1429
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,080
yeah

1430
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,400
i did say try google so you know that is

1431
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,559
the problem

1432
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,840
anyone know what that is off the top of

1433
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,239
their head

1434
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,880
top row or all the symbols shifts

1435
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,280
across

1436
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,920
sorry is that a trick question

1437
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,800
i don't know what that is

1438
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,000
yeah i mean you just uh

1439
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,719
should be here

1440
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:25,640
one two three four five six seven eight

1441
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,640
md5 is really uncommon now for uh

1442
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,400
password hashing

1443
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,559
but

1444
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,239
because you can get the answers on

1445
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,559
google

1446
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,920
yeah i mean there's there's there's uh

1447
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,719
issues with collision with md5

1448
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,360
even where like two different passwords

1449
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,960
could potentially

1450
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,960
uh

1451
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,360
turn into the same hash uh which is

1452
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,800
definitely a problem

1453
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,239
um but for

1454
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,679
it's still like

1455
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:03,679
extremely rare and so

1456
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,880
and it's also a very quick hashing issue

1457
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,159
so

1458
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,560
a hashing method so if you're trying to

1459
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,159
cache like a file to verify integrity um

1460
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:15,920
that's generally

1461
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,480
uh okay like if you check virustotal

1462
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,840
like it will uh

1463
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,760
it'll turn into a shaw

1464
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,159
hash see this one isn't actually a file

1465
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,679
or a process

1466
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,320
but uh it's uh

1467
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,000
that's kind of the way you would check

1468
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,520
uh if

1469
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,120
a file was uh

1470
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,280
what you thought it was or if it matched

1471
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,759
something else

1472
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,360
like that's also what happens in like uh

1473
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,920
police databases and whatnot it's like

1474
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,920
does this file exist on this other

1475
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,000
person's computer can we correlate

1476
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,120
um

1477
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,480
this person definitely sent this thing

1478
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,000
to this other person

1479
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,800
um and prove something happened so this

1480
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,120
is uh i think this is about

1481
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,320
about it you're free to continue to uh

1482
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,920
do the exercises

1483
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:22,960
um

1484
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,560
until uh next week

1485
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,480
and the uh

1486
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,840
the ctf uh i'll call at uh at one and uh

1487
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,840
i'll let everyone know when uh what the

1488
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,560
uh

1489
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,800
um

1490
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:41,040
who the winner is but uh

1491
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,960
i'll just walk around see if if i can

1492
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,239
help anything but uh

1493
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,840
uh for a week

1494
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,120
so there's other platforms like this uh

1495
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,560
similar but not

1496
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,280
this is the only one i've seen that does

1497
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,600
this whole uh experience of you can see

1498
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,000
the web application you can exploit it

1499
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,080
you can then you know see the files you

1500
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,800
can see the file system the uh

1501
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,400
you know all these different elements

1502
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,840
you break it and then you can learn to

1503
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,880
fix it

1504
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,480
um like there's other platforms like

1505
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,640
secure coding warrior but that one is

1506
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,560
more of you don't actually do any coding

1507
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,679
yourself

1508
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:20,560
uh

1509
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,480
it's like

1510
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,440
um

1511
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,679
like this is the topic we're talking

1512
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,239
about this specific coding language here

1513
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:31,440
is uh an example application here's all

1514
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,360
the code you don't get to see anything

1515
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,080
um but it's more of like a teaching you

1516
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,280
code review

1517
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,640
um and then you have to identify like

1518
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,199
what the different

1519
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,360
what it is but the problem is how to fix

1520
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,040
it but it's more like clicking from a

1521
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,040
drop down list rather than actually

1522
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,679
doing anything yourself so i prefer this

1523
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,920
one um

1524
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,360
the uh

1525
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,040
it's definitely pretty sweet

1526
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,520
until 1pm so

1527
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,640
yeah

1528
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,000
i think uh

1529
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,719
that's one question

1530
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,440
so after that will this avatar available

1531
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,480
for me to try and test the uh like

1532
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,880
exercises and challenges

1533
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,960
yeah so avatau is uh

1534
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,920
avatau is uh

1535
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,199
generally for uh to be sold to companies

1536
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,480

1538
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,000
