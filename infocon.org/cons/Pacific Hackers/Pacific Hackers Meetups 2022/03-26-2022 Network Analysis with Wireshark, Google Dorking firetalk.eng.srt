00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,599
underrepresented communities

70
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,920
you know to get into this field and you

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,560
know so since we're starting we launched

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,280
this back in august of last year

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,760
uh since this is very new not you know

74
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,480
we

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
don't have a lot of members yet uh but

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
we have so far we have a successful

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,519
success story and uh it's actually on

78
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,360
our youtube channel uh we're gonna

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,280
promote in the next few weeks

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,200
but um you know there's a few ways you

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
can help us obviously we have a i don't

82
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,000
know if you can scroll to the right uh

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,959
it's actually to the left

84
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,760
yeah

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,879
keep going

86
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,640
we have to fix that but there is a

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
donate button i know it's hiding you

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,799
know and that's probably why we can't

89
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,959
get any donations right because it's not

90
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,439
internet right so anyways uh we have a

91
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,120
donate button where you can actually

92
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,319
help uh you know you know monetary but

93
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,159
then also there's other ways you can

94
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,760
help us right so obviously students

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
we're not expecting you to pay and and

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
this by the way we're not going to

97
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,959
charge this or anything like that but

98
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,879
the way you can you know help us is by

99
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,040
spreading the work if you know someone

100
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,360
who who wants to get into the field

101
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
regardless of honestly the race doesn't

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,759
matter uh where you came from or or

103
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,759
anything their status just just send it

104
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,079
our way you know we're gonna take them

105
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,080
to to the level of eventually they're

106
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,440
gonna get to

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,199
get a job in cyber security that's our

108
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
goal right so um so one way is obviously

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,759
donate with money to spread the word and

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,600
you know and tell your your your

111
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,280
companies you're already working for a

112
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,040
company and they have a

113
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,840
donation uh match or something like that

114
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440

stuff like that so um i mean again there

118
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,880
is many ways you can do it or or just uh

119
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,919

127
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,960

128
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,360
and then uh so let's uh go ahead and

129
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,199
click on the uh um

130
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,479
this yeah so alan you know it was very

131
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,680
generous to share a link on the meetup

132
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,759
comments and if you haven't uh just go

133
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,240
to meetup.com pacific hackers and you

134
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
will see the comment there um so alan

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,479
you know mentioned something that i

136
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,759
think we should talk about and it's

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,199
about the county

138
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,919
you know the county group right so

139
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,440
i think uh this has opened the eyes for

140
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,280
everybody uh in at all levels because

141
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
i think from the higher up perspective i

142
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,039
think

143
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,919
they see us securing people as their

144
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,479
lunatics they just want money they just

145
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,479
want this and that but there there's

146
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,600
actually no

147
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,840
no cyber crime out there you know or or

148
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
it's not going to happen to me or or

149
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,759
only big corporations are in danger you

150
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,160
know small corporate you know small

151
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
businesses are not and that's not true

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
and and the county leagues provost that

153
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,680
you know

154
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,000
there this is an uh uh

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,919
or not an organization

156
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,880
that is

157
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
very well organized there's

158
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,199
documentation to do the uh

159
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,800
uh exploits and stuff like that it's

160
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,759
very well written even better than you

161
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,479
know

162
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,919
like some schools that they you know

163
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,000
they have actually like education stuff

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
like that you know they doesn't even

165
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
show how powerful they can be in terms

166
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,520
of making them you know uh an impact

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,919
negative impact to companies right

168
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,880

against that so he disgruntly

191
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,919
uh decided to to steal all the

192

um so what is uh googling so

340
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,839
it's searching for information about

341
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,760
someone or something on the internet

342
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,839
using the search engine google

343
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,319
sorry

344
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
via google.com

345
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,000
so

346
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,120
so how does google search work

347
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
so google

348
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,440
uh engine

349
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,880
crawls

350
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
and indexes

351
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,320
websites

352
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,440
and they serve

353
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,160
various results depending on

354
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,399
[Music]

355
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,000
your profile unless you use like an

356
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,519
anonymous profile

357
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,440
um it's like

358
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
not as personalized to your account

359
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,880
so crawling

360
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
is uh when google searches the web with

361
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,199
automated programs called crawlers

362
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,040
and they're looking for pages that are

363
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,440
new or updated on the web

364
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,079
google stories source these urls

365
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,000
in a big list or database or several

366
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,959
so

367
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,079
you can

368
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,079
look at them later

369
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,550
there are many ways to look at these uh

370
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,160
[Music]

371
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,759
there are many ways to crawl

372
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,960
but um how they do it

373
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,920
[Music]

374
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
is kind of like secret

375
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,320
um

376
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,000
[Music]

377
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
and the way they crawl is they go

378
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,639
to se i just probably send like

379
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,959
um some code that this girls and then

380
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,959
they go within each

381
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,360
arrow that's inside of this url and then

382
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,279
they collect all the information

383
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,839
on that webpage

384
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,440
links content

385
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,000
all the texts and whatever's on there

386
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,920
you store it and then they make this

387
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,680
like huge

388
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,800
graph

389
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,240
or like

390
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,199
and just add it to like their databases

391
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,359
and then what they do is they index all

392
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,760
this information um

393
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,439
and they try to analyze what each page

394
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,919
is about

395
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,240
they analyze everything try to

396
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,400
understand it

397
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,079
and the information stored is in

398
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,280
something called a google index

399
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,079
and they serve

400
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,839
uh the results

401
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,359
when

402
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,360
everyday people like you and i or

403
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
whoever

404
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,840
uses their search engine

405
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
so what i'm aware um

406
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,120
so

407
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,280
nowadays there's a lot of devices right

408
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,360
like everyone has like a laptop cell

409
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,160
phone

410
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,679
smart watch smart tv et cetera

411
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
and most ilt devices come with

412
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,039
a browser built in

413
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,919
and

414
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,440
if not it's

415
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,039
there's also some way where it connects

416
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,280
to the web

417
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,720
so so why should we google better

418
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,679
um

419
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,760
so it's to save you time

420
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,000
and

421
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,039
save you effort actually um so how this

422
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,720
came about was

423
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
uh the other day i was helping a

424
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
classmate in our security plus class on

425
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,919
a quiz

426
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,280
and i was working my classmate john

427
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,480
and i noticed um the googling for the

428
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,320
answer was a very

429
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,880
like ask.com style if anyone remembers

430
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,679
that

431
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,320
uh com was this

432
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
different search engine a couple years

433
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,440
earlier than google where you just asked

434
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,600
a question and it would try to find

435
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,120
answers for you

436
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,559
based on your question

437
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,120
but uh ask.com was very hit or miss

438
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,919
because uh you know early days of search

439
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,000
uh it is what it is i think just kind of

440
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,559
still alive for some reason not sure

441
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,640
um

442
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,840
let's see

443
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,480
so present day there are like tons and

444
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,440
tons of search engines like bing

445
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,320
go yahoo but today i'm only kind of

446
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,000
mainly focused on google

447
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,039
um

448
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,400
so the way google works

449
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,080
uh less is more

450
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,000
you're using their database of index and

451
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,400
crawl website information to find

452
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,360
uh the top results or the best results

453
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,559
they're uh

454
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,799
machine learning ai and algorithms

455
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,840
um i think are relevant to you and based

456
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,200
on other people's

457
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,000
similar searches

458
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,919
but the way you search and how you

459
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,760
search really affects your results

460
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,799
so a quick example is like

461
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,400
uh let's say

462
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,840
um you're going for a job interview you

463
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,880
go in

464
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
once you can talk about your entire life

465
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,080
but you know it's going to take a long

466
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,039
time

467
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,360
a better way just to be

468
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
giving a summary a 30-second elevator

469
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
pitch by yourself so you're like clear

470
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,679
concise to the point

471
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,200
and

472
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,160
if

473
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,919
you need more information to

474
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,280
if you need to give out more information

475
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,120
you can just add more and that that's um

476
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,640
more efficient than like

477
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,120
just saying about your entire life etc

478
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,600
okay so i have seven main tips on how to

479
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,039
google better

480
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,799
um so

481
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,559
definitely keep it simple

482
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,240
narrow down your keywords and be very

483
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,000
specific

484
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
use important words

485
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,960
um only

486
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
be as descriptive as you can in a few

487
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,280
words because google search uses

488
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,200
keywords mostly to search

489
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,039
the name you're looking for

490
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,520
and if you're looking for like a pdf

491
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,720
image

492
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,559
video or

493
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,440
some type of file it could be a username

494
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,679
or password you know for uh

495
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,600
educational purposes

496
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,799
and maybe a webpage or someone's email

497
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,360
etc

498
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,360
number two you should gradually add

499
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,640
search terms

500
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,440
um

501
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,880
so

502
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,799
i'll have an example later

503
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,039
and i can explain that a little better

504
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,400
but um

505
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,400
definitely uh less is more

506
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,679
the third one sometimes when you arrange

507
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,240
your search terms in a different order

508
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
it affects your search results

509
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,400
um

510
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,840
so i recommend playing around with your

511
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,120
search order

512
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,159
uh i personally haven't had too much

513
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,400
trouble with this but i was reading on

514
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,760
the articles uh for this presentation

515
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,760
that uh sometimes it actually does

516
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,120
the fourth one

517
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,840
uh don't include your answer in your

518
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,158
search um

519
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,760
let's see how to explain this uh

520
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,600
so if you kind of know what you're

521
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,440
looking for

522
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,640
but you're not looking for

523
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,320
something uh

524
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,960
about that exact thing

525
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
um

526
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,039
you can kind of throw off uh the search

527
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,240
engine

528
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,039
uh

529
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,039
i don't have the example at this point

530
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,039
right now um but it's

531
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,440
it's kind of like

532
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,559
redundant in a way

533
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,400
i do apologize for this very fresh

534
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,520
presentation

535
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,760
uh

536
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,960
five you can actually exclude

537
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,640
sites words

538
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,600
and etc in your search with a minus sign

539
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,120
so when you're searching for something

540
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,240
you put

541
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,600
let's say pacific hackers

542
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,520
wore it

543
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
you don't want to search for you put the

544
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,679
minus sign in my name and you could

545
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,400
exclude uh topics like that from your

546
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,760
search so it's kind of like wait for

547
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
uh six

548
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,000
um so google search uh

549
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,200
as everyone has a hopefully done

550
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,280
um you go to google.com

551
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,039
and you're searching for stuff

552
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,520
there's a certain tabs they have there

553
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,919
that are like our images videos shopping

554
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,400
textbooks etc so everything's already

555
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,159
capped pre-categorized

556
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,000
so you don't really have to search as

557
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,960
hard

558
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,600
and you might get better results

559
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,360
uh and seven

560
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,720
there's an advanced

561
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,120
search feature we can change different

562
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
change different constraints and use uh

563
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,400
your like

564
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,039
a range of filters

565
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,480
like time

566
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:28,770
uh

567
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,970
[Music]

568
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,200
it's just a

569
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,559
little like uh

570
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,840
bells and whistles that comes with the

571
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,280
search engine for you to refine your

572
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,159
search

573
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,880
and it saves you a lot of time um but it

574
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
does take a lot of practice

575
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,919
and

576
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,520
some of them i didn't know i mentioned

577
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,360
muscle later

578
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,039
one cool thing you can actually do i

579
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,960
didn't know this you can view uh public

580
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,039
webcams um

581
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,000
that are out there it's kind of

582
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,960
interesting what uh you can do google

583
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,360
okay next

584
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,919
okay i'll briefly mention this um

585
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,159
because uh the presentation isn't

586
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,120
uh

587
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,880
focused on

588
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,919
uh

589
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,760
google docking and

590
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,000
it's more like googling in general

591
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,159
so like google door game is a hacking

592
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,000
technique that makes use of google's

593
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
advanced uh search services to locate

594
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
valuable data data or hard to find

595
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,240
content

596
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,600
it's also known as google hacking

597
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,679
you can find a whole bunch of google

598
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,440
search uh bunch of stuff that google

599
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
search

600
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,679
let's say you're in cyber security and

601
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,679
you want to find things like usernames

602
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,240
passwords emails numbers

603
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,200
files

604
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
servers

605
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,919
and databases this is h keys api keys

606
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,000
environment variables etc

607
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,840
um

608
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
if someone's put it out there it's

609
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,520
probably out there so uh

610
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,279
we hear a lot about

611
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,679
these uh cyber security hacks from

612
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,679
different groups from like big companies

613
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,559
small companies goes into the news

614
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,799
and it's because someone misconfigured

615
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,880
their

616
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,720
api keys they put it into their github

617
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,520
or

618
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,320
some

619
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,159
they put their passwords like a plain

620
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,159
text file we can just read passwords one

621
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,080
two three four five six where they don't

622
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,520
change your passwords

623
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,840
um things can be looked up things are

624
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,799
available to public

625
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,159
so

626
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,559
my recommendation is uh definitely try

627
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,919
to

628
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,760
limit what you put out there

629
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,390
and

630
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,919
[Music]

631
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,039
definitely

632
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,559
be more worried about

633
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,880
the information is shared and

634
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,559
learn cyber security best practices

635
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,760
um

636
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,320
how much time

637
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,880
a couple minutes couple minutes okay i'm

638
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,440
gonna try to do a live demo

639
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,159
but because it's live no guarantees

640
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,360
how good the results will be

641
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,799
so

642
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,559
my first example

643
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,600
that i

644
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
a couple days ago was

645
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,640
um

646
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,919
trying to figure out what pacific

647
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,200
hackers was because

648
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,919
it's the first time i've ever been here

649
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,600
i never heard of pacific

650
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,679
tigers despairs

651
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,279
and i didn't know what it was then it

652
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,600
was like a media group an online group

653
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
maybe like club or something so

654
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,760
i was searching and then

655
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,159
i went through some really weird

656
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,720
websites it wasn't this location it was

657
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
some other place

658
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,679
but i'll

659
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,840
i'll search and we'll see

660
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,720
what the results show

661
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,760
but because we're on this profile i have

662
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,679
i'm going to call incognito so my

663
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,840
searches aren't um

664
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,760
personalized to my profile but more like

665
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,320
a general person to make it more

666
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,720
inclusive to everyone's channel

667
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,250
so let's go to google.com

668
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,240
[Music]

669
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,120
to

670
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,559
uh reiterate from what i mentioned

671
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,960
earlier i was working with my uh

672
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,520
classmate john um

673
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,240
we were trying to figure out his quiz uh

674
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,640
but then we didn't know

675
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,080
um

676
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,520
how to google

677
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,120
super efficiently uh it does take a lot

678
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,240
of practice

679
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,120
um and then things i was encountering

680
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,840
with my classmate and also on my search

681
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,399
for pacific hackers

682
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,320
was i

683
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,720
or we use like very

684
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,919
broad

685
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,080

day and i was like

714
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,559
a good question though yeah so that kind

715
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,440
of throws off your searches

716
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,760
um

717
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,080
yeah let's let's take a quick look at it

718
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,120
so this uh pacific hackers association

719
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,760
uh like you mentioned the non-profit yes

720
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,960
and then

721
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
and you know for me personally coming

722
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,760
here to speed up like oh is this this is

723
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,159
what i'm looking for so i kept searching

724
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,080
so let's go back to the

725
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,200
browser

726
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,399
and then our

727
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,120
uh

728
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
search engine the next one says p hacks

729
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,440
so what is p hacks.org

730
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,320
let me click this

731
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,679
oh it looks very similar to the last one

732
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,399
um and it was talking about like summer

733
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,679
camp

734
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,640
um

735
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,080
and some other things

736
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,320
and it hasn't been updated since last

737
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,440
year

738
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,640
um

739
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,279
so i was looking around on all these

740
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,000
like different uh web links and tabs

741
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,799
like schedule to figure out like

742
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,600
oh is this gonna

743
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,760
be in person or something for tomorrow's

744
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,480
uh

745
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
presentation

746
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,679
and i looked here there's

747
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,960
things from 2019 i was like this

748
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,720
is correct you know

749
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,240
so i went back

750
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,080
and i searched up

751
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,279
i i remembered seeing uh irving's

752
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,799
discord channel

753
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,159
mentioning about something about vita

754
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,399
right okay um

755
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,480
to go back on what i mentioned earlier

756
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,000
uh

757
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,399
i think it was gradually add terms to

758
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,640
make your search uh more defined

759
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,520
so i can look up pacific hackers meter

760
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,760
and the first result is uh

761
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,320
media.com pacific hackers

762
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,240
and i was like okay what is this maybe

763
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,360
this is

764
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,720
a different result

765
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,399
and i found

766
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,520
here

767
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,279
um

768
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,799
and i was looking through the webpage

769
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,640
and i wasn't really sure if this was the

770
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,600
one

771
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,840
but i remember uh ever telling me

772
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,360
uh tomorrow or today 26 saturday 1pm so

773
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,720
i clicked this one

774
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,120
i scroll down

775
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,520
and i saw urban's name on there okay

776
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,760
this is probably it i signed up for the

777
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,679
meetup and here we are

778
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,480
yeah

779
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,480
um

780
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,799
it's

781
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,200
42 so a minute or so

782
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,679
a minute or so

783
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,080
okay um quickly i'm going to mention the

784
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,919
fun things you can do with

785
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,399
googling or slash google torquing

786
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,399
some things

787
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,880
that i kind of do but also didn't know

788
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,159
about

789
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,320
so you can do pronunciations you can

790
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,600
search like

791
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,320
how to pronounce this word and it'll

792
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,640
have like a

793
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,480
speaker icon where you can click it you

794
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,720
know to like sound out the words for you

795
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,399
which is pretty cool you can look up

796
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,679
definitions

797
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,200
um you can do something called reverse

798
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,919
image search uh it's really good in like

799
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,840
cyber security or

800
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,760
you just want to find like the origin of

801
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,720
the image or if the image is real or

802
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,039
whatever use cases you like drag and

803
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,679
drop your image or you upload it and

804
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,679
google search will find very similar

805
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,720
results

806
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,399
or you can use it to like confirm if the

807
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,559
image is actually real it's been used

808
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,679
before someone else owns it etc but

809
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,760
you know it's very limited to their

810
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,919
engine not the other engines

811
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,039
i think

812
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,559
um

813
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,960
some uh new ones i didn't know about you

814
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,799
can use the uh

815
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,360
or operator like in uh programming like

816
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,640
canon or

817
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,760
um

818
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,760
i haven't used it yet but i think you

819
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,200
can

820
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,440
have it like filter your results more

821
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,960
specifically

822
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,919
um

823
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,519
and you can also search within a body

824
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,279
title or earl

825
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,919
or for example certain websites

826
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,679
so that's very interesting

827
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,600
you can also

828
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,440
find a patent

829
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,600
uh haven't used that either which is

830
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,720
pretty cool

831
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,960
um

832
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760

team for yourself

953
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,400

954
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,920
and if you're gonna do that then share

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,440
this is not meant to be a actual contest

1031
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,880
where we're kidding each other and

1032

1034
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,319
always say in all my classes i don't

1035
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,599
care about that kind of stuff so

1036
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,880
feel free to work together to solve

1037
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,079
if you're stuck on the question let me

1038
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,240
know

1039
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,160
but i can very much uh showcase some of

1040
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,599
the beginner categories unless you guys

1041
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,520
just want to hit the road

1042
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,319
and

1043
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,079
hit those the the questions on your own

1044
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,880
go for it so maybe you can go

1045
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,720
just first one

1046
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,560
sure so this very first one in the

1047
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,560
beginner category 1001

1048
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,680
the question at the bottom

1049
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,680
is the question

1050
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,040
for this

1051
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,720
so it wants you to open

1052
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,040
uh wireshark download slow okay

1053
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,480
right here open http why should download

1054
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,720
slow

1055
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,880
yeah so in that analysis

1056
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,640
we'll just scroll all the way down

1057
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,319
to uh

1058
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,280
where to go wireshark

1059
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,800
download slow there it is

1060
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,240
so i double click this

1061
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,760
open with wireshark

1062
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,119
use as the default please

1063
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
so the question here is at what packet

1064
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,839
does the user request slash

1065
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,839
download.html

1066
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,280
so

1067
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,800
[Music]

1068
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,640
we look here

1069
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,160
and i see

1070
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,760
in packet number 10

1071
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,319
a get request

1072
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,279
for the home page

1073
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,760
i can see that in

1074
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,480
hypertext transfer protocol

1075
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,440
there is the get request

1076
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,480
for the home page

1077
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,319
well

1078
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,480
if i'm looking as the question is asking

1079
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,599
me

1080
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,800
for the slash download

1081
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,640
the easiest thing that i can do with

1082
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,240
wireshark

1083
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,720
is open up hypertext transfer protocol

1084
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,160
as you see here

1085
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,440
open up the get request find the actual

1086
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,400
request method

1087
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,359
right click that

1088
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,880
and say apply as a filter

1089
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,079
that way

1090
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,880
it shows me only the packets that are

1091
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,680
get requests

1092
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,599
because there's

1093
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,160
23 000 packets and i am not about to go

1094
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,319
through every single one

1095
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,200
but

1096
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,319
i can apply the filter selected

1097
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,160
and instantly i get all the get requests

1098
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,119
i just went from 23 000 to 74

1099
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,319
in just that one click so you can just

1100
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,440
scroll down

1101
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,520
and you'll find the get request for

1102
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,680
slash download

1103
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,440
that packet number

1104
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,359
on the left side that number is the

1105
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,000
answer to that question

1106
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,640

so i'll repeat that one more time

1109
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,319
i have the first question in the

1110
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,319
beginner category

1111
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,240
it has me open up

wiresharkdownloadsload.pcapp

1113
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,200
the question

1114
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,280
is that what packet does the user

1115
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,910
request slash download.html

1116

[Music]

1117
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,319
i open up that file

1118
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,280
but i am not about to look through 23

1119
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,319
000

1120
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,760
on my own that would be very stupid

1121
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,599
i'm going to find the first get request

1122
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,520
that i see which is asking for the home

1123
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,599
page

1124
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,920
in the details pane

1125
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,800
i have hypertext transfer protocol i'm

1126
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,040
going to open that up

1127
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,200
i have a get request here i'm going to

1128
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,200
open that up

1129
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,520
i'm going to go to the actual section

1130
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,800
that is

1131
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,040
the get request

1132
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,520
i'm going to right click that

1133
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,319
and i'm going to apply it as a filter

1134
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,160
because the only thing i want to answer

1135
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,599
the question

1136
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,839
is the the packet number for the get

1137
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,079
request to the download page

1138
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,319
i don't need anything else

1139
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,760
so i hit that

1140
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,520
i instantly filter

1141
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,200
out of the 23 000 packets to just 74.

1142
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,879
now it's just a matter of scrolling

1143
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,079
until i find

1144
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,920
that html

1145
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,599
and it is

1146
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,480
right there on that screen

1147
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,240
we're looking at the answer is in the

1148
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,720
number column

1149
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,200
leftmost

1150
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,319
so i will walk around and help anybody

1151
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,720
else who needs help

1152
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,230

uh you can minimize wireshark

1179
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,640
just right click on the bar itself

1180
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,279
all the files are in here

1181
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:39,480
and then find the http download slot

1182
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,400
and open up the get request

1183
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,559
so now you can see where is this request

1184
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,880
again

1185
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,119
and apply it as a filter

1186
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,280
that way you just look at only

1187
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,119
all the get requests and now just by

1188
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,280
scrolling you'll find the one that that

1189
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,280
is the answer to the question and again

1190
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,800
it's the number

1191
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,119

00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,599

1200
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,839
find a workaround

1201
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,319
yeah so just scroll all the way down

1202
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,720
wireshark and say you know what let's

1203
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,839
just be the default

1204
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,510
another right there

1205
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:03,619

1211
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,559
um

1212
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,840
[Music]

1213
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,839
you want to dig in so find the first

1214
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,040
packet that has a get request

1215
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,558
scroll down just a bit like packet 9.

1216
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,520
and then i dig into the protocol itself

1217
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,960
yep double click it to open it and uh

1218
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,720
and dig into the get request itself

1219
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,559
and now there's request method so what i

1220
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,720
do is i right click that

1221
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,559
and then i apply it as a filter that way

1222
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,040
it shows me only get requests and then

1223
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,400
it's just a matter of scrolling because

1224
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,880
it's easier to sculpt with 74 than it is

1225
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,119
right so once i apply it

1226
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,280
yeah

1227
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,640
success yes overall

1228
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,240
success good

1229
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,770
[Music]

1230
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:14,720
good also yeah so they changed this

1231
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,640
now we have to look at the question

1232
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,960
again

1233
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:21,680
what packet does

1234
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,040
again if you are already proficient

1235
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,640
and we want to skip the beginner section

1236
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,799
and do other ones go for it i did see

1237
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,319
that permission issue but i think with

1238
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,640
uh chmod you can change that permission

1239
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,000
and you'll be good to go on any file

1240
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,330
[Music]

1241
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,760
let's go back to the question and let's

1242
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,400
write the answer it says

1243
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,200
go back to the question now are you

1244
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,480
looking at this or are you looking at

1245
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,680
the question

1246
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,720
go up

1247
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,919
scroll up scroll up scroll up

1248
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,680
departure green you got it right

1249
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,720
so

1250
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,240
it's that number yeah that was the

1251
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,200
answer

1252
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,720
so now you can close that question and

1253
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,280
open up the next one and then can i just

1254
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,200
click on it yeah all right so then the

1255
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,680
next one

1256
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,720
there you go

1257
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,280
kind of similar

1258
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,119
so you open up a different

1259
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,160
uh different files

1260
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,640
the question is open vlan channels

1261
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,599
communication happening

1262
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,599
let's go to

1263
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,440
let's go to the network

[Music]

1294
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,079
how long will our accounts persist after

1295
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,960
we log out they will persist until

1296
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,839
i reset this game for another event

1297
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,680
on this

1298
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,680
one

1299
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,920
if you feel like using your local

1300
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,000
wireshark

1301
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,119
over

1302
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,160
the

1303
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,400
the browser instance

1304
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,240
i put the link in the chat

1305
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,920
it's in chapel university

1306
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,520
if you want to download the files it's

1307
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,640
the

1308
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,200
they range anything from a gig to two

1309
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,240
gigs or i think this is the smallest one

1310
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,720
um but you can download these

1311
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,160
it all the

1312
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,760
all the package user files from our

1313
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,799
package

1314
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,000
pcap files

1315
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,359
the the workbook 101 troubleshooting and

1316
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,839
the big book

1317
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,280
okay so you can click on the

1318
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,440
supplemental pages

1319
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,280
for example if i click on this guy

1320
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,599
there is a supplement one and a half

1321
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,480
gigs to download

1322
01:05:59,119 --> 01:05:59,920
so

1323
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,039
these are these are all been

1324
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,559
pre-downloaded

1325
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,000
on that instance that you're using but

1326
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,680
if you feel like you want to use your

1327
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,640
local

1328
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,880
wireshark instead that's that that would

1329
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,760
be the way to go so download those

1330
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,880
those supplemental files

1331
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,520
and open up locally

1332
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,559
so you can you can do it either way

1333
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,240
um i just go to

1334
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,920
i just searched wireshark books

1335
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,240
and you find the chapel university link

1336
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,440
oh yeah

1337
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,920
yeah that's the place

1338
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,160
so if you want to do it locally you just

1339
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,760
have to download the files if you want

1340
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,839
to just not download anything and use

1341
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,319
everything from your browser it's all

1342
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:54,880
there for you

1343
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,119
all right

1344
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,039
let's see here this

1345
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,160
really you use the same file to answer

1346
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,680
the questions

1347

1369
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:15,120
is

1370
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,120
just right click

1371
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,080
right click on this one

1372
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,799
those those green boxes are hiding the

1373
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,279
the actual answer applies as plus filter

1374
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:26,719
right selected

1375
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,960
for what that one or

1376
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:33,560
is that what the ins what i wrote to do

1377
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,759
so i didn't say to do that i just said

1378
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,479
look at frame one

1379
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,198
right look at 802.1 q section

1380
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:47,279
which is right there the third

1381
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,279
and that'll tell you to see those boxes

1382
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,640
that's where the answer is lying

1383
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,439
[Music]

1384
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,199
sometimes you don't gotta overthink it

1385
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,440
okay

1386
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,760
so we have this one id 0

1387
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,159
id 32 so packet 32.

1388
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,920
here

1389
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,000
oh this is

1390
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,559
yeah yes you're right

1391
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,920
um

1392
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,040
ah this one

1393
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,080
let's go back

1394
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,120
and i want to know the time

1395
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,480
between uh packets

1396
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,560
oh what is the initial round trip time

1397
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,360
oh that's easy

1398
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,040
packet one is the beginning of the

1399
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,239
of the capture so it has all zeroes

1400
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,920
so how long did it take packet two to

1401
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,800
show up

1402
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,400
oh god so just the one below yeah

1403
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,199
yes okay

1404
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:09,559
right sometimes don't overthink it

1405
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,800
the one that follows it though

1406
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,880
uh 2002

1407
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,960
is the same question but asking packets

1408
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,800
nine and ten

1409
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,719
so uh

1410
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:24,880
you don't need to use a calculator

1411
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,600
because wireshark does it for you

1412
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,120
so for example

1413
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,360
if you go to

1414
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,960
uh packet two let's say we wanted to

1415
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,320
know the difference in time between

1416
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,800
packets two and three

1417
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,640
you would right click

1418
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,600
packet number two

1419
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,520
and set time reference

1420
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,080
so rather than busting out a calculator

1421
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,600
and doing what is sixteen seven five

1422
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,400
five six minus that i can just

1423
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,960
set it as the time reference

1424
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,679
and now we find that packet three

1425
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:02,080
happened that many milliseconds from

1426
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,880
packet two

1427
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,480
and when you're done you can always

1428
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,760
right click

1429
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,400
and set on set and everything restores

1430
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,880
let's see going back to the chat i'm

1431
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,840
having trouble with uh 113

1432
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,560
[Music]

1433
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,110
where'd it go

1434
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:26,139
[Music]

1435
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,080
113.

1436
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,520
how many milliseconds did it take to

1437
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,880
download this file when the get request

1438
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,120
was made in packet 561

1439
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,719
i'm not sure how to tell when the packet

1440
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,600
finished downloading

1441
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,920
uh that is

1442
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,400
download slow

1443
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,080
why shark download slow

1444
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,719
so first of all we got to get to packet

1445
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,679
561.

1446
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,400
there it is

1447
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,719
hey there is the request

1448
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,320
for

1449
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,159
that file

1450
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:20,640
the easiest way that we can figure this

1451
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:21,920
out

1452
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,600
is by following

1453
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,840
the

1454
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,560
stream

1455
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,320
that way we ignore everything else

1456
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,840
except this conversation

1457
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:39,280
we have this pop-up of the stream itself

1458
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,360
that's cute

1459
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,280
but we can follow the same exact thing

1460
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,040
that i just did

1461
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,000
of right clicking this

1462
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,719
and setting the time

1463
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,480
and then scroll to the bottom and see

1464
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,440
how long it took at the end

1465
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,920
does that make sense eileen

1466
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,000
cool

1467
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,640
yeah sure which question

1468
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:17,260
okay

1469
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:20,439
[Music]

1470
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,519
this is all what's this

1471
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,519
um

1472
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,760
it's in the wireshark ctf folder

1473
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,159
internet analysis or that so everything

1474
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,719
is going to come under that in that file

1475
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:43,719
yes

1476
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:53,600
[Music]

1477
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,960
all right so we don't care about that

1478
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,280
that's just talking about a response

1479
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,120
from again

1480
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:03,670
you may get requested 200 okay

1481
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:06,739
[Music]

1482
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,000
okay

1483
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
so

1484
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,120
because on packet 10 it's requested the

1485
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,120
homepage

1486
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,760
since that is a valid get request

1487
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,360
i can uh you can close that

1488
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,040
identification

1489
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,560
values

1490
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,880
open

1491
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,239
because that that packet is getting less

1492
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:03,120
and we are looking

1493
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:20,700
[Music]

1494
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,600
that's why i have everybody open up

1495
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,679
hypertext transfer protocol in the

1496
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,840
packet details pane

1497
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,440
open this yep

1498
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,199
that's what i just did

1499
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,599
got that

1500
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,639
so then open up the get request itself

1501
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:43,719
and now there's request methods

1502
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:04,470
[Music]

1503
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,679
further down and you remember five two

1504
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,360
one all right so here

1505
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,400
that's right and apply the filter

1506
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,640
selected one

1507
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,520
six

1508
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,560
seven

1509
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,440
hey

1510
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,840
now you have just the get request and

1511
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,600
now it's just a matter of scrolling

1512
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,000
until you see the one that's where they

1513
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,320
appear through here

1514
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,560
and now you can find the one that has

1515
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,320
html yeah

1516
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,799
how can i

1518
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,480

23 000.

1520
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,360
why does the show the http okay packet

1521
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,880
in the conversation

1522
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,199
wait poorly worded i'll ask again later

i think so i don't know

1540
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,960
what's that different

1541
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:37,080
let's try this

1542
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:56,819
[Music]

1543
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,679
there's a feel for everything

1544
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:12,560
[Music]

1545
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,400
no

1546
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,560
is there any math involved to figure out

1547
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,400
the time well i actually can do time for

1548
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,320
you you can do time math

1549
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,040
so

1550
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,520
we have one time it starts and then time

1551
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,000
ends yes we need the difference yes okay

1552
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,719
so

1553
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:37,760
wireshark does that for you

1554
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,560
that's what i showed earlier

1555
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,199
um i'm just going to open up this one

1556
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:47,280
just for kicks and giggles

1557
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,480
if i wanted to see the difference

1558
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,840
between two and three

1559
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,520
not going to bust out a calculator okay

1560
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,040
this thing can do it for you just right

1561
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,440
click on the packet you want

1562
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,239
and set it as the time reference

1563
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:01,520
immediately

1564
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,840
it tells you how many seconds

1565
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,960
packet three came from packet two oh

1566
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,239
okay

1567
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,639
this is which friend

1568
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:14,159
that you're learning how to do so

1569
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,320
what question was that

1570
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,799
what number was it

1571
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,639
random number

1572
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,440
oh okay

1573
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,920
you're right no you're not right click

1574
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:49,480
i hope not

1575
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:56,589
[Music]

1576
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:01,639
okay

1577
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,320
too many people it's overflow well good

1578
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,320
thing is you can get the questions the

1579
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,760
questions you can still get to the

1580
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:08,960
questions

1581
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,080
and the the files you can get them from

1582
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,519
wireshark from the wireshark book site

1583
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,960
but good to know because this this is

1584
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,639
actually the first time we're trying i'm

1585
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:24,560
trying this system with

1586
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,800
20 plus 24

1587
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,840
plus 5 6 7 8 9 10 thirteen fourteen

1588
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,280
fifty sixteen

1589
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,360
seventeen whatever that number is thirty

1590
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,639
forty people

1591
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,120
there's not an error

1592
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,960
and then click on this one now memory

1593
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,600
just hit a hundred percent change

1594
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,560
that's all

1595
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,880
you know

1596
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,679
good to know which is a good test for

1597
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:50,159
you right oh yeah absolutely

1598
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,600
because i want to i actually do want to

1599
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,760
take this platform to defcon

1600
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,080
so this is a good test to see a good

1601
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,440
stress test

1602
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,840
and go okay it needs more ram

1603
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,159
i gotta download more ram

1604
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,480
actually

1605
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,800
right yes

1606
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,040
your attention really quick so i forgot

1607
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,600

1629
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,000
[Music]

1630
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,560
sure is there a link for that and is the

1631
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,320
training free

1632
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,600
you get a pass to rsa so if you're

1633
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,520
in person okay

1634
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,760
so first question what was the first

1635
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,320
question is there a line is there a link

1636
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,960
hi you guys the link is right here

1637
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,360
it's two physical links so yes

1638
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,679
email me if you guys are interested in

1639
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,280
helping or presenting yourself so

1640
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,120
presenting better let me let me put it

1641
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,480
this way this is a way for you to

1642
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,000
promote yourself

1643
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,800
so because i'm not sure

1644
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,000
but i think you can eventually send us a

1645
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,800
value and a picture they will post you

1646
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,880
basically basically will have your name

1647
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,880
in the rsa page right

1648
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,840
okay so but don't quote me on that

1649
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,600
that's what we're hoping it's going to

1650
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,360
happen

1651
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,520
so to answer your question

1652
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,760
there's no link to sign up the link is

1653
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,239
sending him or me an email

1654
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:57,440
and uh we will uh

1655
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,080
you know we will put it in there for the

1656
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,960
online talks

1657
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,880
obviously it's going to be pre-recorded

1658
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,440
what we ask is whenever we put in the

1659
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,440
time frame that we put you in

1660
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,600
be available for questions and answers

1661
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,280
so even though you're not gonna not

1662
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,760
gonna be talking like live

1663
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,000
but people are gonna have questions and

1664
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,679
then you potentially can i don't know

1665
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:21,280
how that's actually going to work

1666
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,760
potentially can speak you know for the

1667
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,440
questions or just type the questions i

1668
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,800
think it's going to be typed i think

1669
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,239
it's going to be yeah yeah

1670
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:30,639
the live response if you are

1671
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:33,199
helping us in person

1672
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,560
uh you're going to get a rsa pass

1673
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,400
and uh

1674
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,679
i mean

1675
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,239
but what else you want

1676
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,920
i say it's getting i don't think they're

1677
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,440
doing the passes like they used to

1678
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,960
anymore they're getting more like

1679
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,239
changing

1680
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,239
so um they changed

1681
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:51,360
yesterday

1682
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,440
oh yeah yeah they didn't have a free

1683
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,760
pass for expose and now they do oh they

1684

different so it will get you

1704
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,080
i think it's not just the basic it's a

1705
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,600
little bit

1706
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,280
like from the levels

1707
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,239
so um you'll get something in return for

1708
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:39,840
sure for just helping

1709
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,080
you know and and then the reason why so

1710
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,920
let me let me talk about that

1711
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,440
should we get one for just being a nice

1712
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,239
guy

1713
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:47,840
no

1714
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,280
not yeah

1715
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,440
so the dark car so

1716
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,800
so villages um actually in in rsi are

1717
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,400
called sandboxes so

1718
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,400
the way you're going to find this is

1719
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,280
under sandboxes so if you go rsa

1720
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,239
um

1721
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,320
look for on there

1722
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,719
online or not the what oh nevermind the

1723
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:08,880
darkhearts village yeah yeah if you want

1724
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,159
to just go to the star card

1725
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,239
you can yeah there you go

1726
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:18,400
yep yeah that one

1727
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,520
the first one here we go

1728
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,480
we're so dark even the background's dark

1729
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,880
actually match so

1730
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,560
so these those are the

1731
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,880
the sandboxes that are going to be in

1732
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,600
there now villages usually you find in a

1733
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,719
def con

1734
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:37,679
uh uh or rsa or v sites or something

1735
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,000
like that but in rsa they call it

1736
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,320
sandboxes but dark cars is a it's a

1737
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,360
village that it's actually participates

1738
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,000
in black hat and defcon right

1739
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,159
so

1740
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:55,040
i um lost my final thought uh okay so

1741
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,760
rsa this year or because the newer

1742
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,159
seasons are becoming are

1743
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:03,040
more technical than the previous ones

1744
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,280
they want to see more of the hands-on

1745
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,920
technical things right so

1746
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,080
this year rsa is

1747
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,800
giving us the opportunity to make this

1748
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:16,239
rsa more technical not just selling you

1749
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:19,040
a bunch of equipment and and

1750
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,040
hopefully you'll you know configure them

1751
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,360
right so you'll prevent all the bridges

1752
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,960
uh this year we're actually going to

1753

if you never attended rsa let me

1820
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:48,400
oh actually

1821
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,800
let's start there how many have attended

1822
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,560
rsa

1823
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,360
so not that you know half and half uh

1824
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,639
for the ones that have not attended rsa

1825
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:00,320
this this conference is one of the

1826
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,159
biggest in the world but

1827
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:05,280
it's meant for executives who are

1828
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,840
actually budgeting for you know how much

1829
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,719
i'm gonna give you for to buy your toys

1830
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,080
you know security so it's it's a

1831
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,400
combination of both but it's

1832
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,520
it's meant for um uh those executives

1833
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,040
who are gonna be signing up those uh

1834
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,159
checks

1835
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:22,320
um all the companies in the past it's

1836
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,280
still not going to center all four right

1837
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,520
yeah so they uh

1838
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:32,159
yes so they have over 2 000 vendors um

1839
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:34,719
so that's when he said uh uh t-shirt

1840
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:37,199
shopping it's not really shopping

1841
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:38,159
because

1842
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:41,600
you go every single booth that you go in

1843
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,280
you know they try to talk to you for

1844
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,960
like five minutes and then you get a

1845
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,040
free t-shirt right so by the end of the

1846
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,800
day or the three or four days that you

1847
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,360
attend you'll get like bags of t-shirts

1848
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,639
so actually

1849
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:54,320
all the t-shirts that i use i personally

1850
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,520
use are t-shirts from rsa

1851
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,600
and that's i've been accumulating from

1852
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,400
for the last five years um so yeah it

1853
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,560
has way you know uh t-shirts so it's

1854
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,280
good

1855
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,280
also if you're interested in how a

1856
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,840
product works they they have their demo

1857
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,639
section each company shows you a demo of

1858
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:14,239
whatever product so

1859
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:16,480
let's say um

1860
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,400
like wireshark for example it's a it's a

1861
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,400
free tool right but there's also other

1862
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,800
commercial ones that you know they

1863
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,719
literally do the the work for you you

1864
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:26,639
just have to literally like check boxes

1865

and gives you all that there's you know

1866
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:32,400
tools out there but they cost right so

1867
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,000
uh if you want you're interested in

1868
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,400
packet analysis with using those type of

1869
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,440
tools

1870
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,639
then um you know look at the the list

1871
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:43,199
see who which company is that and you

1872
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,280
know reception time for yourself to go

1873
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,360
there right so um

1874
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,440
what you're not gonna see

1875
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,760
is the the technical aspect of things

1876
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,320
you're not gonna learn something new

1877
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,400
although you're gonna learn how a

1878
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,639
product is used so it's just gonna learn

1879
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:01,119
how a vendor works from a product

1880
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:03,520
perspective but not really from the

1881
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,280
basics of like cyber security and stuff

1882
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,719
like that but that pays you the big

1883
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:09,920
picture when eventually you become a

1884
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,960
secure analyst or a cso or whatever the

1885
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,480
case is

1886
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,639
to see what you're getting into right

1887
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:18,719
you know how many technologies out out

1888
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:21,440
there and and then also

1889
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,360
how many of those companies are actually

1890
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,239
worth to to buy right not all of them

1891
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:27,600
you know fortunately i mean that's the

1892
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,800
game right

1893
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,040
some of them are very cheap

1894
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,040
some of them are cheap and good some of

1895
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,840
them are really good and very expensive

1896
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,000
so that's when you start like thinking

1897
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,560
yourself almost like as a homework you

1898
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,360
know

1899
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,920
if i have a budget of 100 000 how much

1900
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,840
can i get you know how much can i buy to

1901
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,080
secure my environment and that's where

1902
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,320
you use rsa to go and look what's out

1903
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,239
there and just kind of like do it as a

1904
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,400
homework you know okay

1905
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,040
i'm gonna give 20 000 to this company

1906
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,360
you know 50 to this company

1907
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,360
and 30 to this one company that's it you

1908
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,960
know you spend

1909
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,840
100 000 in three products which 100 000

1910
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,320
it's it's actually you know probably

1911
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,480
half of one product but i'm just giving

1912
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,400
you as an example but

1913
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,600
anyways

1914
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,520
the information is out there if you want

1915
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,199
to attend for

1916
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:18,159
uh

1917
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:19,199
free

1918
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:22,320
i suggest to google expo passes

1919
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,199
but that's gonna give you scroll down um

1920
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:26,239
this one

1921
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:27,920
it's not really gonna give you

1922
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,119
much right so the 51 dollar one that's

1923
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,320
just gonna give you whatever is

1924
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,639
something on the

1925
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,719
on the on this one right

1926
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,960
um if you want to attend the

1927
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,800
sandboxes which that's where we are

1928
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,239
going to be then you have to get the 300

1929
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:46,719
dollar one the 325 one we have to pay

1930
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:48,960
right now or until may 26

1931
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,119
otherwise it's gonna go up to like 500

1932
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,520
700 and stuff like that same thing with

1933
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,199
um full conference i mean

1934
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,679
if your company can pay you you know

1935
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:01,440
might as well you know

1936
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,639
but if

1937
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:04,480
if you don't then

1938
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,400
you know find a way to do it you have a

1939
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,080
question no i'm sorry

1940
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:08,960
yeah

1941
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,560
well you mentioned that it's more of an

1942
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,880
executive

1943
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,400
conference

1944
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,760
so what kind of audience do you get at

1945
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,520
the sandbox sessions

1946
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,760
what kind of target audience you try to

1947
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,199
educate them

1948
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:24,239
so again uh the previous sandboxes were

1949
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,600
um

1950
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,320
like uh go back to the other sun boxes

1951
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,199
you just have to go back

1952
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:36,400
there so like for ex for example the uh

1953
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,560
uh and they change every year right but

1954
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,159
they try to be more of uh um

1955
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:43,600
um

1956
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,920
can be more hands-on hands-on technical

1957
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,800
so like you know executives

1958
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,280
can see hand uh uh

1959
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,159
you know

1960
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:53,920
what their analysts are actually doing

1961
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,560
right so it's almost like coming here

1962
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,040
and learn something that is hands-on

1963
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,080
so

1964
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,480
now explain try to explain to your boss

1965
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,880
right you know oh i went to this weekend

1966
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,960
i went to pacific hackers and learned

1967
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,520
this okay

1968
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,199
he's just gonna listen to it he's like

1969
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,360
okay that's on spawn but how can i see

1970
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,920
it well either he comes here to learn

1971
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:18,159
about it or he goes and pay you know big

1972
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,880
bucks to rsa and basically learn the

1973
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,719
same things you know obviously the talks

1974
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:24,239
are gonna be more like

1975
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,080
a little bit more advanced you know

1976
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,480
intermediate to advanced but it's it's

1977
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,000
because this is the first year we're

1978
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,119
doing it

1979
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:34,639
we're trying to make it of um

1980
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:37,600
so executives can see the real

1981
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,360
like almost when i mentioned about the

1982
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,960
country leaks you know they didn't

1983
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,440
believe that these organizations like

1984
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,600
criminals exist oh we're just making

1985
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,960
this up you know uh county or you know

1986
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,560
anonymous or

1987
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,800
others you know they're just a bunch of

1988
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,119
you know like us you know just getting

1989
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,520
together and hacked for fun no these are

1990
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,600
organizations who are actually doing you

1991
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,440
know to do harm

1992
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,239
so uh but you know they show proof so

1993
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,880
this is a proof to them that oh i really

1994
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,520
need to spend my money because even in

1995
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,040
the iot

1996
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,679
you know field well here's the sandbox

1997
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:16,880
for just for iot devices right um

1998
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,040
airspace in internet airspace uh

1999
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,639
industry well

2000
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,040
what do you need to learn about airspace

2001
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,760
so i can put my money into it so if you

2002
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,080
look in every single one of them they

2003
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,639
are targeted for a specific one

2004
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:33,679
ours the dark arts it's

2005
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:35,760
a general you know

2006
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,480
here's an exploit this is how exploit

2007
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:41,040
looks this is how you can potentially

2008
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:41,920
your

2009
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,679
your company get harmed you know and

2010
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,360
stuff like that this is if you don't

2011
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,560
invest

2012
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,679
in this right now now now we're showing

2013
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:51,360
you like a proof of concept so you can

2014
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,760
actually go back to the floor talk to

2015
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,440
whatever vendor is selling that

2016
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,920
particular item so you can secure your

2017
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,520
environment right so that's the whole

2018
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,360
purpose so this year that's why they're

2019
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:04,000
trying to make it more technical so

2020
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,480
then the past seasons we don't don't

2021
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,560
have any technical background

2022
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,199
can learn about it and the currency

2023
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:13,360
source or the newer systems are getting

2024
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,600
more technical can actually have fun and

2025
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,679
learn something new right so it's

2026
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:20,239
it's a combination of both so

2027
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:23,280
any other questions

2028
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,480
so yeah if you're interested um uh

2029
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,560
actually i'll i'll put it on the chat

2030
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,840

2053
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,840
moment this is a great opportunity to

2054
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:20,000
get your face in front of people

2055
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,800
to

2056
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,159
talk to tech

2057
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,440
and yes of course we're going to help

2058
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,199
you through we just need to know who's

2059
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:28,880
interested and help you through

2060
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,080
what you're going to talk about and get

2061
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:33,360
the slots all filled yeah so right now

2062
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,280
what we're doing is we're putting

2063
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,760
so it's actually

2064
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,679
we haven't really decided or the person

2065
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:41,520
who we're working with we have not

2066
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,760
really decided on the topic on the uh on

2067
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:46,080
the details per se but what we're doing

2068
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,000
is right now we're putting

2069
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,400
everybody like on a list and we're going

2070
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,800
to say oh this person is is talking

2071
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,480
about this

2072
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,639
by then if there is a talk that it has

2073
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:58,880
more relevance to what we're doing we

2074
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,719
might have to like obviously cancel and

2075
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:02,400
stuff like that but it's better if you

2076
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,719
put your name now because we can say

2077
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,639
well all these people

2078
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,800
already like put their name out there

2079
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,960
like two or three months in advance you

2080
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,400
know it's not gonna be fair for them to

2081
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,480
kick them out i mean unless like i said

2082
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,880
the uh your talk is not really like

2083
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,040
suitable for what we're trying to do or

2084
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,880
anything like that then

2085
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,199
we might have to talk about it but uh

2086
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,320
honestly i don't think that's going to

2087
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,239
be the case yeah and i think you're fine

2088
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:27,760
we're trying to give the opportunity to

2089
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,159
everyone you know to give a talk right

2090
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:33,040
so you know so they can get yourself out

2091
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,280
yeah yes i have a few questions um

2092
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,440
how how like do you tell the

2093
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,850
stockholders

2094
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:40,719
[Music]

2095
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,400
it would it would need to be more

2096
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,400
detailed

2097
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,960
how long

2098
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,480
how long 30 minutes

2099
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:54,080
now like i'm doing a few talks and

2100
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,679
they're they're going to be hands-on

2101
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:57,600
stuff so i'm not really talking for 30

2102
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:58,800
minutes

2103
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,880
it's more like talking talking for a bit

2104
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,239
and then letting people work talking for

2105
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:04,320
a bit letting people work type of thing

2106
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,080
yeah

2107
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,320
how truthful do we have to be on the rsa

2108
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:11,679
conference registration

2109
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:14,960
because i just got to free up that so

2110
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:15,970
so um

2111
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:17,520
[Music]

2112
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,679
when you go and pick up your badge

2113
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:21,520
you have to check they will check your

2114
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:24,639
id yeah so if you put a fake name that's

2115
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:25,920
not going to work yeah well it's not my

2116
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,600
real name

2117
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,719
yeah yeah no i mean i have a company

2118
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,880
right oh yeah for the company that's

2119
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,800
what a student yeah actually

2120
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,440
actually um there's well they used to

2121
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,800
they have a expo pass for students so

2122
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,560
search for that so if you qualify as a

2123
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,400
student hey man as well because you can

2124
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,400
get the full conference for like

2125
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,239
less than half you know

2126
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,800
more like 75 percent off or something so

2127
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,719
that's another way to get in okay

2128
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:00,560
yeah there you go

2129
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,560
cool i don't know what it includes

2130
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,360
the expo pass is just the expo

2131
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,560
that's the the thing that we were

2132
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,719
showing earlier that one this is this uh

2133
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:11,440
this one right here

2134
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,600
you just get to walk around and do shirt

2135
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,000
shopping

2136
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,920
from the vendors it helps you understand

2137
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,719
the market yeah see if you if you give a

2138
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:22,719
talk you could throw that in your next

2139
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:23,840
interview

2140
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,480
yes yes yes yes the hiring manager will

2141
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:29,360
say hey yes

2142
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,760
that's why i work that's why we're we've

2143
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,679

expo pass yeah yes because it helps you

2145

career-wise yeah and actually uh you

2146
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,320
know we have a few successful stories

2147
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,000
from from this group and actually i'm

2148
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,360
one of them so

2149
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,199
when i was starting just like like him

2150
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:47,440
for example he gave his first stop

2151
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,840
i gave my my first talk

2152
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,280
and my manager was in the audience and

2153
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,600
and and my presentation was my my

2154
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,280
interview basically because he didn't

2155
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,560
have to

2156
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,080
i have to

2157
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,639
explain him what i did or what i know

2158
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:04,159
because i already showed him on the

2159
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,400
screen right for on the

2160
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,920
on the presentation

2161
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,480
and he he needed a person

2162
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,480
for that specific presentation he wanted

2163
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:16,400
a person to help him um so uh after the

2164

2207
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:52,800

organization too that's what we're

2209
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:56,159
trying to accomplish that

2210
01:46:56,159 --> 01:46:58,000
companies instead of going through like

2211
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:58,800
uh

2212
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,159
you know hr or like recruiting places

2213
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:04,159
especially for security obviously they

2214
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:06,000
can just come to us and say hey you have

2215
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,159
someone who knows application security

2216
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:10,239

01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,360
we're trying to accomplish with the

2230
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,520
non-profit that they can come to us

2231
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,960
directly instead of

2232
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,360

2233
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,520
