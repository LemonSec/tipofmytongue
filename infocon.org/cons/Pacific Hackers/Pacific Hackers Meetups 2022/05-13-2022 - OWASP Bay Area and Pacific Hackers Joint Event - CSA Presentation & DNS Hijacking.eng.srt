00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
mobile security

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,520
uh

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,840

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,119
i mean very nice uh talks lined up some

27
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,400
morning to you i want to thank you

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,320
and himanshu for providing this uh

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,439
venue and then organizing

30
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,560
uh

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
so with that let me start with uh

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,240
uh uh cloud csa so csa

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,600
there is a

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,240
csa is a cloud security alliance there

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,119
is a global alliance as well

36
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,640
so

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,680
a lot of

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,479
chapters around

39
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,479
so this is a new chapter which we are

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,599
starting sfo csa's support chapter uh

41
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,160
and i'm the chapter lead we have

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,680
code of members

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,200
uh so many people i just walked you

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
through how how to

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,599
get involved with csa and become a

46
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,680
member and then what are the benefits

47
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
you'll be getting

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,160
so that is one apart from that

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,800
actually this talk was supposed to

50
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
be taken by cso of synopsis he's not

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,680
here he has to

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,120
do something

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
for an emergency

54
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,040
uh so i'll take this talk after this

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
talk this is going to be a interesting

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
talk

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,879
so

58
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,440
some domain take over

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
uh it's

60
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
it's more like a

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,280
side hustle i would say very interesting

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,319
passive income generation

63
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,280
kind of a job and if you

64
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,480
in fact uh we will be training how to

65
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
get to there

66
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,519
uh so

67
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,519
there is also surprise at the end of the

68
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
session uh

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
how uh there's a surprise and then the

70
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
benefits of those surprises also so this

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
is what being covered

72
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,879
in next uh 30 to 40 minutes

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,200
okay with that let me start with uh

74
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,440
csa global so what is uh

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,480
csa global it was started i think 2009

76
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,959
seattle

77
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
so the basic intention was ensure cloud

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,720
security i mean

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,280
the cloud place is safe to use

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,400
so that was the primary objective of

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,599
csa so it's a non-nonprofit organization

82
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,159
focused on research and other programs

83
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,360
and

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,159
certifications are also there in that

85
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,200
you can give

86
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,120
a lot of research papers so these are

87
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,080
the basic things about uh the global

88
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
chapter

89
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,760
um so there are total around uh

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,519
uh

91
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,639
130k members all around and there are

92
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,440
400 corporate uh members

93
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,600
30 plus active working groups and then

94
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,120
105

95
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,639
plus chapters all around so this uh

96
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,440
sf4 chapter is very new in fact uh it

97
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,040
was started a couple of months back

98
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,280
so

99
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,800
so we have a long way to

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
go there

101
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
so this is about

102
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,400
the global presence of csa community

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
next is something about

104
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,720
sf4 chapter so the primary focus of

105
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,400
sf4 chapter is

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,240
trying to conduct these meetings and

107
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,960
partner with multiple other groups and

108
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
then

109
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,320
provide

110
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,639
participate in csa research

111
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,360
and promoting

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,840
current regionally

113
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,000
future members and

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
the events these are the primary

115
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,479
objectives

116
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,440
of the

117
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
chapter here

118
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,320
and a little bit about the people behind

119
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,680
this chapter

120
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
so these are the people behind chapter

121
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,320
most of them are sisters except for me

122
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,240
so actually wagner he was supposed to

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,360
take the

124
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,919
talk today he's from he is a cso of

125
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,919
synopsis and

126
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,160
sudesh is the person who actually

127
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,560
started the support chapter

128
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960
he has a multiple phd and he has

129
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,440
contributed for csa

130
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,639
cloud security framework so

131
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,360
so all these information right once you

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,880
log into

133
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,039
once you become member for csa

134
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,520
you can download uh use it

135
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
everything is free

136
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
uh the only thing is you need to become

137
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,479
a member of it and i'll show you walk

138
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,400
you through how to become a member and

139
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,639
take the benefits of

140
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,240
all this cso white papers uh it could be

141
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,319
a lot of literature somewhere and then

142
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,080
any new research is happening you can

143
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,400
download and then

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,440
you can also contribute

145
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
so these are the people behind sfo

146
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
chapter

147
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,919
more about the chapter it's

148
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,120
more to do with

149
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,520
networking with peers subject matter

150
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,840
experts and then

151
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,759
discuss on the research and activities

152
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,319
spread csn security outreach

153
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,120
to the community

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,880
okay what do we do we typically conduct

155
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,479
4-12 meetings

156
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,600
per year

157
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,960
apart from the

158
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,880
other events like this and then

159
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,080
provide education train people

160
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
and provide awareness about cloud

161
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,880
security

162
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,240
ensure

163
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,960
make cloud security a safe uh safe place

164
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,000
to reach

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
uh that is the primary objective and

166
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
then networking annual conferences these

167
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,720
are some of the activities which we do

168
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,680
okay uh there is a huge benefit of

169
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,880
becoming a chapter member uh one is you

170
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,080
get

171
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,440
access to

172
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,680
the training materials you get access

173
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,199
networking

174
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,479
education

175
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,240
and then

176
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,080
very important thing is uh you can be

177
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,400
part of the research group so there is

178
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
30 plus

179
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,400
research

180
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,919
results are happening so if you want to

181
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
contribute this is the best way you just

182
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,160
log in become a member here and then you

183
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
can start

184
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,280
be part of

185
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,000
the research group and then start

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,440
giving

187
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,960
contribute to contribute to the research

188
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,720
and whoever becomes the member they'll

189
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,039
get around 20 discount if you are

190
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,960
planning to do ccs

191
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,400
certification

192
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,440
so that's an added benefit

193
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,800
um

194
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,960
so access to the membership all those

195
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,280
things

196
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,720
okay now um css they have it's very well

197
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,879
organized uh they have a platform called

198
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,800
so circle basically it is like a forum

199
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,319
where you get to interact with

200
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,760
one i think 130k

201
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,559
members all of them so

202
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
any questions you have in cloud security

203
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,799
whether it could be aws

204
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,039
gcp or

205
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,519
gcp or azure you can just post it over

206
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
there best practices any questions you

207
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,959
have if you are a beginner this is the

208
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,040
right place to

209
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,040
start

210
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,560
um other other than that

211
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,640
there is a global website yeah

212
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,199
yes

213
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,479
everything is free

214
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,920
not for profit

215
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,720
so you might might have heard of what

216
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,720
ccs

217
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,480
yeah

218
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
so these are the certificates i mean

219
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,199
well known certificates

220
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,640
again

221
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
very

222
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,120
um

223
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,200
you know they have different

224
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,959
certifications so this is more like

225
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,600
third party risk assessment whereas uh

226
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
csa is

227
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,519
different it's concentrated with

228
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,440
professionals and organizations

229
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,399
this would be more so

230
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
just specifically

231
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,680
yeah they have like a bunch of baseline

232
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,839
so in addition to cis and stuff i think

233
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,720
that would make slime smaller

234
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,720
stuff

235
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,240
and all these trainings are free

236
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,720
yesterday

237
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,839
so csa

238
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,440
so this is the exam site i mean if you

239
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,040
want to give an exam you can just go

240
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,839
there

241
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,240
i think you get a 20 discount once you

242
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
become member

243
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,680
i'll just walk you through how to become

244
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,319
a member as well

245
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
so there is a knowledge center so this

246
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
is uh uh

247
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,760
um

248
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
it is a little bit uh partially

249
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,480
uh

250
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,959
free like uh there are ten modules if it

251
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,800
is there at least four five modules

252
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,760
actually

253
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,399
so

254
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,160
so this is designed in that way this is

255
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,160
this one and ccsc only these two are you

256
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,720
need to pay unless everything is uh

257
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,360
you are good to go

258
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,440
so overall we have around uh 290

259
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,880
research artifacts available for

260
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,760
download 64 research publications uh

261
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,880
that's in 2020 now it is more uh so you

264
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,240
some of them top threads in cloud

265
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,839

283
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,120
and

284
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,839
cloud bytes webinars and contribute to

285
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,200

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,680
this is the same thing you can join

287
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,279
working group from here

288
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,519
yeah peer reviews i just uh talked about

289
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,240
the reviews so whenever

290
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,839
somebody has written a paper so you just

291
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,760
send it across you you get an

292
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,320
opportunity to see that download give

293
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,959
you

294
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,279

so that's the biggest part so you will

298
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,120
be

299
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
listed as part of

300
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,199
the white paper so you would be also

301
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,880
part of the

302
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
peer review list and then that

303
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,959
definitely gives you more recognition

304
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,600
so downloading

305
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,160
artifacts

306
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,279
okay that was quick this was just about

307
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,560
csa

308
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,000
any questions

309
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,920
yeah one thing i missed i'll just walk

310
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,480
you through how to

311
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,639
become a member

312
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,600
it's a little bit tricky uh

313
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,839
so

314
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,839
yes yeah

315
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,079
so one in the meetup there is a link

316
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,839
to

317
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
a csa homepage so this is the csa

318
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,279
homepage

319
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,519
csc

320
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,880
san francisco page

321
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
just taking some time

322
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,399
so here uh there is a button called

323
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,199
become a member

324
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,560
so uh

325
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
so uh in the meetup when you click on

326
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,120
the link uh you will be coming to this

327
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,519
place csa

328
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,959
cloud security alliance sfo home page

329
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,639
then once you come here you just need to

330
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,440
follow these steps

331
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,480
when you click the

332
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,560
uh on that button it'll ask you to log

333
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,440
in

334
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,600
you can just click on login with

335
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,079
google or you can provide uh your

336
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
details then you need to enter your

337
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
basic information

338
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,240
just do a complete registration

339
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,600
and this is a little bit tricky part

340
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,560
then you'll get a captcha you need to

341
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,720
verify

342
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,759
after

343
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,880
that

344
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,399
just agree for thompson's current

345
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,519
condition

346
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,839
yeah so this lot of people miss

347
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,120
uh maybe due to which uh we are not

348
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
uh

349
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,279
the member count is a little less uh so

350
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,360
we are trying to work on this but uh

351
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,880
this is important step you need to click

352
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,480
on the join community

353
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,839
so once you

354
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,360
click on the join community only then

355
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
you'll become a member

356
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,120
so once you become member you get all

357
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
the benefits

358
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,040
and everything is

359
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,199
most of it

360
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,759
so notification you can put

361
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,839
so yeah currently since it is a new

362
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,199
chapter very few people

363
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,560
and

364
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,000
it's a lot to offer uh definitely

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,120
you can make use of it uh so some of the

366
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,160
things to go through are

367
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,680
all the research vehicles if you see

368
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,720
here

369
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,359
security guidance

370
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,438
for cloud computing and then

371
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,319
cloud control metrics all these are

372
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,520
available and if you want to

373
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,280
be part of research

374
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,880
you can just go here

375
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,480
so this all this you will it will open

376
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,280
up once you become a member

377
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,920
yes

378
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,039
[Music]

379
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,720
okay sorry uh we need to go to uh

380
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,840

okay

387
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,960

uh

392
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,559
any questions

393
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,840
now come let's come to the juicy portion

394
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,158
of it

395
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,039
okay how many of you have heard about

396
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,679
this sub domain

397
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,799
so basically uh okay let's let's start

398
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,280
with subdomain takeover okay a little

399
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,799
bit about myself i have around success

400
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,039
i have the following

401
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,960
certifications

402
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,480
i have master's in computer science

403
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,000
cyber security

404
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,600
earlier i was uh os chapter uh

405
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,200
separately now

406
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,919
uh css

407
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,720
about myself

408
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,000
okay today uh in subdominant takeover

409
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,640
what all we'll be discussing

410
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,840
very interesting

411
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,919
topic uh

412
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,440
we'll understand the economics of it

413
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,559
later we'll get into what exactly it is

414
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,640
and types of subdomain took over

415
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,120
and we'll see one use case also

416
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,280
using s3

417
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,480
aws s3 and implications of

418
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,240
subdomain takeover how do you how to fix

419
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,600
such issues

420
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,880
and then

421
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
there is a surprise offering from

422
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,918
especially from

423
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,159
okay so now what is this uh subterminate

424
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,960
take over let me before coming back let

425
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,760
me explain what it is

426
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,679
this sub domain takeover is it's very

427
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,039
simple uh

428
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,919
you have a domain right amazon.com

429
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,919
and then so

430
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,159
for the amazon.com will be providing

431
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,080
information it will be coming from one

432
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,600
of their boxes right some server

433
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,880
what if

434
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,919
uh

435
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,840
this name redirectors

436
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,879
redirect to your server

437
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,760
no what if you control amazon.com

438
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,320
simple this is subcommitting

439
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,240
i mean uh this is uh actually domain

440
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,919
takeover but yeah subsection of it is

441
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,280
subliminating

442
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,080
so this is all we'll be discussing

443
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,840
nothing much

444
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,880
technical

445
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
simple as that you're taking over

446
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,480
amazon.com

447
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,799
okay now the economics part of it

448
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,240
so actually i was a part of uh you heard

449
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
of bug bounty program

450
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,919
everybody has heard of a bug bounty

451
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,000
program so bug quality program i mean

452
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,400
you can as a hacker i mean uh as a

453
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,720
security researcher you go and then you

454
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,640
find a bug and then post it and you'll

455
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,760
get someone

456
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,799
no i i was at the other end i was uh

457
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,120
supposed to review those uh

458
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,159
whatever the findings the hackers

459
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,440
post and then i need to pay them

460
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
so that was my job

461
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,080
and we have

462
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,679
especially uh for the subdomain it's

463
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,080
very easy simple it has become a side

464
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,120
result

465
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,080
uh

466
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,559
it has become a

467
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,760
passive

468
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,799
income generation too

469
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,559
there are few people

470
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,679
hackers who monthly easily they'll make

471
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,000
five to 10k easily

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,400
and i've seen it going

473
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,360
from uh company.com

474
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,440
so

475
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,240
and

476
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,000
it's uh i'm giving you motivation it's

477
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,080
an interesting motivation to learn cloud

478
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,960
security and uh also

479
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,559
uh make it more uh secure

480
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,440
so

481
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
this is uh happening i mean a lot of

482
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,880
people and these are the some of the

483
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,799
metrics where uh

484
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,159
things are uh

485
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,520
you find a lot of

486
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,279
sub domain issues sub domain uh issues

487
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,720
so

488
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,360
these are some of the aws tools and then

489
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,320
azure

490
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,640
wp engine shopify

491
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,799
all all these places you find

492
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,679
these issues so all you need to do is

493
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,240
understand how this works

494
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,440
spin up the

495
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,240
automation tool the moment you get

496
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,760
just create a

497
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
proof of concept and send it to the

498
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,080
bounty

499
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,679
and easily 5 or 10k in your job in your

500
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,000
pocket

501
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,880
i i've seen this a lot of people make

502
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,080
money

503
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,159
it's just a passive income right you you

504
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,600
have a tool automated to generate it and

505
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,559
whenever

506
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,840
uh it finds something it'll alert you

507
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,400
you just create a poc submit to

508
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,120
the bug bounty

509
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
now what are you finding are you finding

510
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,320
like someone took over a subdomain or

511
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,640
are you showing how you continue

512
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,960
uh you you will take over and then show

513
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,720
how to economically

514
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,200
you take it over first

515
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,559
no because

516
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,880
they will you are free to hack i mean

517
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,039
that

518
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
so only uh if we just shows

519
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,679
after taking over he will just put a

520
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,520
screenshot

521
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,120
and the moment we see the screenshot

522
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,279
we'll understand what it's already taken

523
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,480
it's very simple anybody can do fixing

524
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,720
is also very simple

525
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,240
only thing is uh you just need to

526
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,279
understand the technology

527
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,600
yes

528
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
so it is

529
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,200
you won't get into trouble but yeah

530
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,720
first you need to sign up for that work

531
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
bounty program hacker one is one of the

532
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,840
website just go register yourself

533
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
anybody can register

534
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,039
and all you need to do is

535
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,679
understand the tool which i am

536
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,720
trying to

537
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
help create one

538
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,840
and start

539
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,919
so understood the economics behind

540
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,520
subcommittee code

541
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,840
what is subdomain

542
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,440
takeover okay now technicalities of it

543
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,679
so

544
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,200
so sub domain takeover simple

545
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,679
you have https.amazon.com

546
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,279
now what will happen

547
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,919
so this shopping cart dot com it's some

548
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,679
domain so this is the

549
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,640
uh

550
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,240
popular domain

551
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,080
first development this second load

552
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,399
so and you can keep on putting maybe

553
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:37,200
abc.shoppingcar.com

554
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,960
so all these are related to amazon.com

555
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,320
right so now

556
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,279
uh

557
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,520
this shopping cart.com is what you are

558
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,760
trying to hijack

559
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,120
and how you can exact

560
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,640
is what i'll be uh showing you

561
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,159
so https so protocols are coming domain

562
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,080
this is top domain domain so i'm just

563
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,640
split understood this piece

564
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,480
okay now how amazon would have

565
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,799
configured in their servers

566
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,000
so amazon for this shopping cart

567
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,159
they would have configured like this

568
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,320
in their servers simple

569
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,200
so

570
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,760
whatever traffic comes to amazon.com

571
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,799
it has to go to this particular server

572
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,159
that is what they would have configured

573
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,640
so this is a this is called a record so

574
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,080
whenever you do

575
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,360
this little bit about dns how

576
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,520
dns works so it has few records so

577
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,039
directly if somebody clicks on

578
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,200
amazon.com you will

579
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,679
configure amazon.com to one particular

580
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,640
ipad so that is where your server is

581
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,799
so that server will have index.html on

582
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,720
the main page it will go through the

583
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,000
main page and you everything will appear

584
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,279
okay now

585
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,120
you create one more

586
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,159
uh

587
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,679
you create this shopping cart at

588
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,679
amazon.com this is the sub domain you

589
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,440
have created

590
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,520
and you create a cname and it will point

591
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,679
to another resource so he imagine this

592
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,440
is an s3 bucket

593
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,480
aws sd card

594
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,159
now

595
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,880
what will happen

596
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,799
you will be

597
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,080
taking over of this one

598
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,399
you just take over this automatically it

599
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,760
means that you have to take on your

600
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,799
shopping cart

601
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,000
amazon.com so whenever somebody types in

602
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,559
shopping cart at amazon.com it will

603
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,678
point to your resources

604
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,880
that is your box

605
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,039
you can do fishing you can do anything

606
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,279
but that is not

607
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,919
the most uh

608
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,159
important thing the most important thing

609
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,120
is

610
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,960
you just tell them okay i have taken

611
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,080
this over

612
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,039
it's two thousand dollars

613
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,080
yes

614
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,929
[Music]

615
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,240
um i'll come to that see see this is how

616
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,919
uh amazon would have configured

617
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,720
so this is their configuration

618
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,399
yes so all the sub domains will point to

619
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,840
some resource

620
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,360
right this is see

621
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
domain is pointing to one server ip

622
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,240
address this is also pointing to one

623
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,440
resource here in this case s3 bucket

624
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,640
right

625
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,320
now what will happen

626
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,440
uh

627
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,520
so this is very common

628
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,880
especially

629
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,279
uh in huge companies google or any

630
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,640
companies

631
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,600
they'll have this kind of sub domains in

632
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,039
thousands

633
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,440
um not in thousands 30 000. we ourselves

634
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,480
had 30 to 40 000 sub domains and who is

635
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,399
going to keep track of it and all the

636
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,840
developers product teams they will use

637
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,120
the issue

638
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,678
happens

639
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,880
what will happen is whenever uh

640
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,360
they'll be using one uh s3 bucket

641
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,200
they'll just delete so once their work

642
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,679
is done they just delete but they'll

643
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,279
they'll not remove this uh scene

644
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,840
this record they will not remove

645
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,640
this

646
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,559
this resource is uh

647
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,960
down

648
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,360
this is a common phenomenon

649
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,799
scenario very common scenario

650
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,679
[Music]

651
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,399
yeah they're not remotely

652
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,480
deleted

653
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,760
but this record will be there

654
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,159
so in your aws sd bucket it will not

655
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,279
show

656
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,760
but in round 53 if you go this record

657
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,120
will be still there

658
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,360
now what will happen i will log into my

659
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,880
aws account

660
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,039
create an s3 bucket with this name with

661
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,120
that name shopping cart and

662
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,678
the traffic loads

663
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,880
yeah

664
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,840
but it's amazing

665
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,799
to that how to check all those things

666
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,880
that is a very interesting piece

667
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,159
so he he has just uh started his spot

668
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,000
he will alert him oh okay this

669
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,640
particular so he has registered to all

670
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,840
uh

671
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,799
uh accounting program so all the

672
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,200
companies domain names he has just added

673
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,120
and then it will find subdomains and

674
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,960
then it will start checking for each sub

675
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,799
domain whether it is open or not

676
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,919
see this will

677
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,000
eventually open because the developers

678
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,600
they won't they don't have the

679
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,360
understanding of how dns works and then

680
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,679
how see their job is okay open the sd

681
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,559
bucket put their code test it okay done

682
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,760
delete the

683
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,960
s3 bucket

684
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,279
but who is going to clean up it will go

685
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,320
to some sysadmin or server people and uh

686
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,919
they will take their own privacy so

687
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:54,880
meanwhile

688
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
uh you're during this time you just

689
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,000
hello okay i've taken over two thousand

690
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,559
and then okay that gets fixed

691
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,320
that get fixed they'll just remove the

692
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,039
record again after one month

693
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,639
same thing will happen

694
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,239
again it will open up

695
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:10,960
you

696
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,679
you tell okay we have formed

697
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,079
i mean

698
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,320
is he just doing like a trace route on

699
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
the names and seeing which ones fail

700
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,639
and then saying

701
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,679
who is going to take it away

702
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,879
he can sell his

703
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,839
scripts

704
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,159
so this is let's see a subdomain

705
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,079
takeover this is just one

706
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,000
small portion of it

707
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,599
it's a very huge topic

708
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,440
in tokyo take over yesterday i'm just

709
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,599
talking about st bucket so similarly

710
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,520
there is so many other

711
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,119
resources which is connected similarly

712
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,800
like this right c name when it gets

713
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,200
connected to some mail server

714
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,480
you

715
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,320
take over it and then

716
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,599
send it to the

717
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,480
hacker one definitely

718
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,320
so huge

719
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,760
but it's very important to understand

720
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,560
this uh how it happens and fix is very

721
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,920
simple

722
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,200
you have to just delete this

723
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,640
right

724
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,560
it's only uh

725
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,280
the disconnect between the product teams

726
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,000
and the infrastructure team

727
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,920
that is going to be forever i think

728
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,640
yeah

729
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,879
so this issue is there i mean people are

730
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,520
so yeah types of subdivide

731
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,839
cname nx

732
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,000
so these are the other things so in

733
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,720
senior takeover what i showed you is

734
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,839
just a part of it there are so many so

735
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,560
people find lots so this person right he

736
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,599
just switched on so he finds before us

737
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,400
and he finds every month because every

738
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,800
month uh the product team right we also

739
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
tell them provide them training

740
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,920
please ensure once you remove this

741
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,560
once you stop your

742
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,320
sl bucket go and uh remove the

743
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,640
pns recorder

744
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,920
how do you do that

745
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,880
you are still figuring it out

746
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,440
but we i have figured out

747
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
uh we have come up with that solution as

748
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,200
well but uh

749
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,520
in reality i mean that tool

750
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,440
it's very difficult to

751
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,200
develop even

752
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,119
some of the cloud

753
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,000
security companies say themselves

754
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,079
so i mean just uh

755
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,599
whatever i explained i'm just showing

756
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,520
you so

757
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,280
the person from 53 it goes to

758
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,240
s3 bucket now what you do is uh so this

759
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,919
so the record will be there

760
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,960
now

761
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,560
so you will get this is the fingerprint

762
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,359
so once uh that person right he runs his

763
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,320
bot

764
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,720
and when it keeps on running so this

765
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,480
particular sub domain will give this

766
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,599
kind of

767
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,480
issue so it's a simple python program

768
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
you just need to use

769
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,920
the python program and then keep

770
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,280
checking

771
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,040
the response

772
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,960
response object if you get this kind of

773
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,560
response right

774
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,440
two thousand dollars

775
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,160
well once you get this response what you

776
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,359
need to do is

777
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,760
all you need to do is just replace your

778
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,720
s3 bucket name with this phone and then

779
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,280
take our screenshot send it to them

780
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,839
saying that okay it's been done

781
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,800
can you automate creating buckets yeah

782
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,240
okay okay

783
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,760
so all you have to do once you see that

784
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,440
create the bucket

785
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,119
these other people are going to send an

786
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,440
email

787
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,760
so this is

788
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,040
see all those are just resources

789
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,280
so cd name connects to resource

790
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
so any resource which is shut down or

791
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,960
stopped

792
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,280
it can be taken over and the simplest

793
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,240
one is

794
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,800
it's as simple as that it's just

795
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,839
it should be cname takeover

796
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,400
the issue is with the cnn so you have

797
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,800
the sub domain you are associated you

798
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,119
are giving a repository

799
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,480
so whenever that particular

800
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,640
sub domain is entered it will go fetch

801
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,560
that repository now that repository

802
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,960
itself is deleted what it will do it

803
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
will not do anything so it will give

804
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,640
this kind of error so hackers what they

805
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,320
will do it will show what is the bucket

806
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,240
name also or what is the resource name

807
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,680
take the resource name create that

808
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,119
resource

809
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,280
and connect it to this and then

810
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,440
so whenever somebody enters that

811
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,119
particular resource it will point to you

812
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,240
your

813
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,240
repository

814
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,440
so this is what will happen so

815
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,920
let's get so people lot of product in

816
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,240
they'll just delete this

817
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,599
but this

818
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,280
so this is what a hacker creates or

819
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,319
anybody

820
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,640
we can create and then i'll create a

821
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,078
point here and then that's how

822
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,280
you can misuse or uh you can

823
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,160
earn money or

824
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,799
passive income

825
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,920
okay this is our surprise offering so

826
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,599
since we have started a

827
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,440
css4 chapter

828
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,480
we plan to provide training on

829
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,839
the subdomain

830
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,760
takeover so basically

831
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,480
help understand people

832
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,520
how

833
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,200
subdomain takeover happens uh parallelly

834
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,319
along with that also educate uh provide

835
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,200
details on we start with uh on hands-on

836
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,440
session everything is free we'll be

837
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,560
starting

838
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,960
maybe in a month or so once we get a lot

839
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,280
so we'll be providing dns security i

840
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,040
mean basics of dns

841
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,880
starting these are the topics which is

842
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,960
covered then principles of subdomain

843
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,119
takeover

844
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,480
so

845
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,359
what is subtrometric or fingerprinting

846
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,680
footprint how to fix it

847
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,160
all these details then cloud basics also

848
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,839
will be covered uh aws azure and gcp so

849
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,839
basically this can be done for all kind

850
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,839
of funds not only

851
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,160
aws so subdomain takeover you can do it

852
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,760
for

853
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,160
other clouds also

854
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,000
azure is quite uh interesting um

855
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,480
so you'll uh so these are the things

856
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,599
which should be

857
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,800
and then

858
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,440
hands-on sub-domain decor how to do

859
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,920
uh the takeover of s3 and also cname

860
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,400
takeover

861
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,640
domain takeover

862
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,599
and then this is the important part

863
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,280
coming to

864
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,960
