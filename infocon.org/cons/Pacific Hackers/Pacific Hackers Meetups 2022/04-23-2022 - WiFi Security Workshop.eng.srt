anything about maker nexus so make your

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,440
nexus

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,440
you know gave us the space to basically

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,399
post this uh prior to this or in fact

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,720
prior to the pandemic we used to do it

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,840
at the uh

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,320
martin luther king library in dalton san

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,119
jose uh that was also a big space but

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,280
you know pandemic here you know we have

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,799
to do it you know remote and now um they

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,439
open and let us in and you know we're

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,479
very thankful for them so i always like

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,960
to talk about what they do so it's a

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,360
kind of like a makerspace uh slash

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,439
hacker space because you know if you pay

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,360
a fee you come and basically use

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,280
everything that they do here uh 3d

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,840
printing

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,799
you know electronics so if you're into

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,960
batch life you know you can come and do

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,040
your own electronics or badges and stuff

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,880
like that so and if you don't know how

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,960
to do it they also offer classes that

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,640
you can do you know for that so um so uh

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,439
many people don't know but we also have

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,280
let me move this here

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920
so we became a non-profit organization

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,880
as well so and we just add the

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
association to pacific hackers

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,399
so uh

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,520
obviously uh here everything's free uh

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,440
we're not gonna charge you but for

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,280
specific hackers association as a

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,400
non-profit

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,160
we're actually taking it to the next

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,560
level and we're helping people and we're

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,360
focused on variants and underrepresented

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,840
communities to get into cyber security

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
uh we know that

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,920
you know this the system is broken uh

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,400
the hr system is broken you know they

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920

now on my main one

170
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,199
i'm getting host disabled participant

171
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,360
screen sharing

172
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,400
oh really interesting okay

173
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,719
okay can you try it again

174
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,199
yep

175
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,280
all right

176
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,560
okay

177
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
i'm actually using my second

178
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,319
sign-in

179
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,919
as a monitor so i can see where i'm

180
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,919
presenting so i'm seeing the screen so i

181
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,160
think everyone is good now yeah we're

182
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,759
seeing the presentation right now

183
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,199
perfect perfect all right let's get on

184
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,319
with this then okay

185
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,440
all right

186
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,560
so good afternoon everybody

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,759
we're going to talk about wi-fi and

188
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,840
wi-fi

189
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,360
security i am going to talk

190
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,759
about a lot of primitives and

191
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,919
i'm assuming that

192
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,360
there may be some people who are new

193
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,560
with this so

194
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,199
i will go off on a tangent talking about

195
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,840
certificates on symmetric and asymmetric

196
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,560
encryption if you know more about it

197
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
if you know all about it you could take

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
an extra coffee break

199
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,440
so i'm going to keep this from the

200
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,240
basics and don't worry we will get into

201
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,800
the weeds very very quickly

202
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,440
so this is me i'm gonna it's on the

203
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
video if you want to know more

204
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
watch the video again i work for a

205
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,919
company called nc expert we do a lot of

206
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,400
cisco training wireless training cyber

207
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,720
security training

208
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
uh here's my contact information you are

209
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,280
more than welcome to reach out to me

210
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,639
and of course the company i work for

211
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,639
would love you all to call up and

212
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,919
buy some

213
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,319
cyber security or wireless training as

214
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,879
well in hint

215
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,199
i uh gotta do this

216
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,960
what i'm gonna show you today are real

217
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,479
things you can do

218
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
to your next-door neighbors wi-fi please

219
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,160
don't do that if you do it's your

220
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
responsibility

221
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,240
me company i work for

222
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,680
the guys and guards of pacific hackers

223
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,520
are not responsible if a black fan

224
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
pierced ourselves your door because you

225
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,120
thought it might be fun to

226
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
attack the naval base

227
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
near you or something

228
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
uh so this is real stuff we're gonna

229
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
talk about today so again be careful

230
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,080
what you do okay

231
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,159
so i want to talk about basic security

232
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,920
concept as i said if you're an

233
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,399
experienced tech user you can go have an

234
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,920
extra coffee break for 10 minutes but i

235
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,519
want to talk about these things because

236
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,279
we're going to refer to them

237
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,800
in the rest of the presentation they

238
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,480
were going to talk about wi-fi security

239
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,120
and everybody knows wi-fi security right

240
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,200
i set wi-fi at gam gam's house over the

241
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,240
weekend

242
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
took me 20 minutes so real-wise security

243
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
is a little bit more complex

244
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,480
than

245
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
just setting a box up at gun guns house

246
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,440
they will talk about what's wrong with

247
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
wi-fi

248
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
then we still say surely it's not that

249
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,839
easy to break spoiler alert

250
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,519
it is

251
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,440
is there hope

252
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,880
we're talking about some top tips for

253
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,959
why that wi-fi defense in the home

254
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,240
probably a bit late now maybe should

255
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
have done this two years ago because a

256
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,680
lot of us have worked from home for the

257
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,200
longest time

258
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,839
and there's loads of stories out there

259
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,519
where um nasty people have tried to

260
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,640
break in

261
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,360
to

262
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,959
corporate networks they're gonna afford

263
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,399
to get they've got a cisco firewall

264
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,240
whatever and no

265
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,839
no you're not coming in

266
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,760
so they then follow an executive home

267
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,680
and break into their wi-fi at home

268
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,279
because their passwords like system one

269
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,360
to three or something right once they

270
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
break into the wireless network they

271
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
have full access to your network and now

272
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,440
the beauty of wi-fi hacking

273
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
is you can do it from

274
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,560
half a mile away okay i don't need to be

275
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,399
inside your building

276
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,440
being caught by the security systems i

277
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,680
can do it from the grocery store parking

278
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
lot across the road

279
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
okay i will do a demo of attacks and

280
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,640
some defenses i will open up the q a and

281
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,600
again

282
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,200
time

283
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,480
time allowing

284
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,320
uh we may finish a little early we may

285
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,560
finish a bit longer i i try not to go

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,200
over two hours and uh perhaps you guys

287
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
can help me remind me on that

288
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,360
i do like this i do enjoy this so i can

289
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,040
get carried away as

290
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,120
as you may know if you've met me or seen

291
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
me before

292
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,839
so let's start off with basic security

293
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,240
concepts right starting off at security

294
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,880
101 okay apparently the first person in

295
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,279
security was julius caesar

296
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,560
he wrought on a a piece of wood a rod of

297
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
unknown size

298
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,079
information coiled up some cloth wrote

299
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,320
on it converted it into the underwear of

300
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
a roman soldier and got them to wear the

301
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,079
underwear when you're in the roman army

302
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,240
and the general says wear this go there

303
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,320
you don't argue and the paperwork that

304
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,240
was in the pouch was completely false

305
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,760
information

306
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,680
i believe i've heard stories that julius

307
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,079
caesar was the first person that used a

308
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,040
cipher method to encrypt it

309
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
so we need to talk about the cia

310
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,160
not that one

311
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,399
that one

312
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:23,360
confidentiality integrity and

313
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,920
availability are the security pillars

314
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,120
today

315
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,720
there are two more we have to take aware

316
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,560
of that's authenticity and

317
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,518
non-repudiation

318
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
there are two types of encryption that

319
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,560
we have today

320
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
symmetric and asymmetric put simply

321
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,000
symmetric uses the same key

322
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,680
the problem is getting the key to the

323
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,240
other party asymmetric is you create a

324
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
key pair and you keep one private and

325
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,399
you make one public

326
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,160
you can whatever you encrypt with one

327
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
key but only decrypt with the other

328
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,360
whatever you equip with the other key

329
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,720
you can only equip with the one you have

330
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,519
so you keep one private make one public

331
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,079
asymmetric key encryption uh

332
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,160
keys are approximately 10 times larger

333
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,839
and also take 10 times the cpu power

334
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,519
we also have hashing which is a form of

335
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,920
security it does not involve encrypting

336
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,839
the data but it involves taking a

337
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,600
mathematical

338
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,680
calculation to an algorithm to get a

339
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,920
hash value of the fixed size irrelevant

340
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,680
to the size of the data and you can

341
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,480
encrypt the hash value if you

342
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,639
encrypt the

343
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,639
the symmetric if you sorry let me do

344
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,399
that again if you encrypt the hash key

345
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,560
with a symmetric key that is known as a

346
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,959
hash key or a symmetric hashing if you

347
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,959
encrypt the hash value with an

348
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,360
asymmetric key that is a special name

349
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,320
called a digital signature or digitally

350
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,800
signed

351
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,440
now symmetric encryption give you the

352
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,720
five p the five pillars confidentiality

353
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,639
integrity availability authentication

354
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
and non-affiliation yay the problem we

355
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,720
have though is getting the symmetric key

356
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,920
over to the other party

357
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,320
if you do asymmetric encryption remember

358
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,480
you have one private key and one public

359
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,959
key the public key is freely available

360
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,399
and known to

361
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,240
everybody you don't care the private key

362
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,720
is kept very very secret

363
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
if you encrypt with the private key it

364
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,560
can only be decrypted with the public

365
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,880
key because everybody knows the public

366
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,000
key

367
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,240
everybody can decrypt what you've

368
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,720
encrypted so you have integrity you have

369
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,200
availability you have authentication and

370
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,959
you have non-repudiation

371
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,359
what don't you have is confidentiality

372
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
if you

373
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,440
encrypt with your sorry let me do it

374
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
again if you encrypt with the other side

375
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,000
public key that they've made

376
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,440
available

377
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,279
only they can decrypt it so now you have

378
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,440
confidentiality and availability so it's

379
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
not easy using asymmetric encryption to

380
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,079
have all five what you have to do is you

381
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,160
have to first of all

382
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,720
encrypt with your private key

383
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,680
then do a second encryption with their

384
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,000
public key

385
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,440
and you have to assume that the other

386
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
party has your public key okay then this

387
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,600
double encryption gives you all five of

388
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,040
the cia

389
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,439
pillars

390
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,160
as you mentioned if you do symmetric

391
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,279
hashing

392
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,639
just understand straight away that

393
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,399
there's no confidentiality because

394
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,040
you're only encrypted the hash value but

395
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,720
you do get the other four right

396
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
integrity availability authentication

397
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,120
and non-repudiation

398
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,160
same with asymmetric asymmetric

399
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,040
excuse me asymmetric key hashing or

400
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,279
digital signatures you don't get

401
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,199
confidentiality but you do get the other

402
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,040
full

403
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,720
so hashing per se doesn't give you

404
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,880
confidentiality but it does give you

405
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,120
non-repudiation you can't deny sending

406
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,440
it authentication it was you and you can

407
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,920
prove it was you the center availability

408
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,440
it keeps the system and the data

409
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
available integrity you know the data

410
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,399
hasn't changed

411
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,920
so all that bob and alice need to do is

412
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,000
always bob and alice remember all the

413
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
bob and alice need to do is give each

414
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,240
other their public keys

415
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,320
and then they have this perfect form of

416
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,920
communication

417
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
where they can get all five of the

418
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,399
pillars of the cia triad that's wrong

419
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,639
isn't it all five of the cia triad but

420
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,040
you know what i mean okay all three of

421
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,880
the ca try it on the extra two we have

422
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,040
today

423
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,519
they can now communicate perfectly but

424
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,120
there's a flaw right

425
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,320
what if

426
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
what if they want to communicate but

427
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,519
nasty hacker jumps in the middle

428
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,120
nasty hakka

429
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,199
intercepts the information and sends his

430
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,399
public key

431
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,000
down to alice

432
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,639
so now we have a problem where how do we

433
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,639
make sure the key that we are using

434
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,720
really is the key that we want and

435
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,000
that's where

436
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,480
certificate authorities come in

437
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,199
we pay a fee we send off our public key

438
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,360
to a certificate authority they

439
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,199
digitally sign

440
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,240
our key

441
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,680
that they are private to you

442
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,000
okay and that creates what we call a

443
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,519
certificate

444
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,800
why am i telling you all this because we

445
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
used to forget in whites that's only one

446
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,120
if you know this if you if you all get

447
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,680
your hands up phil it's way more complex

448
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
than that you're wrong absolutely this

449
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,519
is meant to be a very simple overview

450
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,720
okay

451
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,959
it's a lot more complex than this but i

452
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,320
believe this is the uh the basics

453
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,240
so knowing this you can understand what

454
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,480
comes next

455
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,880
so what happens is the stiffened

456
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,720
authority because usually you pay them

457
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,600
they send back the certificate and you

458
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
don't send your public key out you send

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,079
it out in the form of a certificate

460
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,759
so when you send your certificate down

461
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,959
to alice alice authenticates your

462
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,160
certificate

463
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
using the public key that she's gotten

464
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,800
from the certificate authority and she's

465
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,480
either installed this

466
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
beforehand or it's pre-built into the

467
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,160
operating system or the web browser

468
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,959
so

469
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,760
certificates are used as an option

470
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,959
in

471
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,919
wi-fi networks

472
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,559
okay that brings us on to now the theory

473
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,799
of wi-fi and wi-fi security

474
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,319
so you need to be aware of the following

475
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,000
people in wi-fi

476
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,640
they are very important

477
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,240
fcc is the regulatory authority that

478
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,000
control power limits frequencies and

479
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,240
channels the ieee create standard that

480
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,880
create the standard and amendments to

481
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,360
the standard often called standards and

482
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
protocols but there really only is one

483
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,760
standard and the current standard is the

484
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,240
2020 version of the ieee 802.11 standard

485
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,160
everything else ax for example is an

486
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,160
amendment it will be absorbed in in

487
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,559
about four years or so when the next

488
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,160
update happens

489
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,840
then you've got the wi-fi alliance now

490
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,160
the wi-fi lights are really good people

491
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,400
they are vendor-based but they're a good

492
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,480
bunch of people and they what they do is

493
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,840
they convert the ieee

494
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,559
rules into workable

495
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,799
real rules and the wi-fi alliance have

496
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,880
more power than the id everybody thinks

497
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,120
everybody does what the ieee says they

498
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
don't everybody does what the wi-fi

499
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,360
alliance says

500
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,799
prime example have you ever heard of

501
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,840
etiquette 11 i

502
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,600
nope never heard of it phil that is the

503
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,840
ieee security

504
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,640
amendment that was renowned renamed as

505
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,000
wpa and wpa2 oh yeah why didn't you say

506
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,799
so because one's an ieee amendment one's

507
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,880
a wi-fi alliance certification i'm gonna

508
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
edit to 11e

509
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,559
hardly any people have heard of that

510
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,480
that's quality of service you use a

511
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,559
variant or a big day today but you use

512
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,520
the wi-fi alliance a rework of it called

513
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,000
wmm

514
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,880
okay

515
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,240
so the ieee do a lot of good work take a

516
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
long time to do it but it's got to be

517
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,640
done properly the wi-fi alliance convert

518
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,679
the output of the ieee into more usable

519
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,679
functionality so just running off the

520
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,760
top of my head if you want to

521
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,480
use networking today 2022

522
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,840
and you want to be secure and you want

523
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,600
to be protected you've got to use edit

524
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,840
lma

525
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,480
b

526
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,440
d

527
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,799
e

528
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,919
g

529
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,280
i h

530
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,320
w

531
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,200
or

532
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,520
you sign up and you buy the equipment

533
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,080
that is wi-fi alliance voice

534
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,280
personnel or voice enterprise compatible

535
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
and you i'm going to worry about all the

536
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,320
letters you know that when you go to

537
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,640
market and you buy a client that's voice

538
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,039
enterprise capable you know it will work

539
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,559
with cisco aruba mist ruckus meraki

540
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,799
extreme all of them

541
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,720
so the wi-fi alliance are the real power

542
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,679
base and you see their certifications

543
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,520
quite often printed on this the box of

544
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,520
the usb wi-fi adapter that you buy

545
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,360
now we don't believe in re reinventing

546
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,440
the wheel so quite often

547
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,360
we in the wireless community and the

548
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,000
wi-fi alliance will reuse current

549
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,440
protocols like capua radius

550
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,240
they are ietf protocols and we will

551
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,880
reuse them within our certification of

552
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,000
the wi-fi alliance

553
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,159
the one thing to be aware of

554
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,480
very important is

555
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,720
not the ethernet form of broadcast

556
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,200
but wireless

557
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,000
is a broadcast medium that means you are

558
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,480
transmitting your signal out into the

559
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,039
air now that means just like broadcast

560
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,000
radio just like broadcast television

561
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,120
that means anybody can pick it up right

562
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,919
that means anybody can hear it

563
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,240
and interpret it

564
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,440
now one

565
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,520
very little known fact about wi-fi is

566
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,159
that if i are down 10 again if i upgrade

567
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,799
my antenna to a bigger better more

568
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,960
powerful antenna on my client that means

569
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
i can hear your

570
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,520
access point louder

571
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,600
so an antenna not only

572
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,159
broadcasts louder it allows you to sure

573
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,760
loader

574
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
so distance away should never be a

575
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,520
security mechanism

576
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
with wi-fi i've walked around the

577
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,480
perimeter we can't see the ssid being

578
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,440
advertised outside of that little room

579
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,039
in the middle where i got the open

580
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,080
network that i onboard my phones

581
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,039
and

582
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,120
okay and i do a proof of concept to show

583
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,280
them that if i increase the antenna on

584
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,880
my client i can hear that ssid just fine

585
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,480
thank you write that down underline it

586
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
distance should never be a security

587
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,600
mechanism

588
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,840
especially in wi-fi let me say that

589
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,400
again if i increase the

590
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,760
gain of my antenna i can hear your wi-fi

591
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,400
network from across the supermarket

592
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,840
across the road

593
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,919
which is typically outside your boundary

594
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,559
security you you try and keep everything

595
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,440
inside the fence secure the grocery

596
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,159
store across the road is where i'm sat

597
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,200
outside your boundary i can still break

598
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
into your network okay that's very

599
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,400
important to understand with wi-fi

600
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,919
so the boogeyman is out there there are

601
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,600
monsters in the world we need to be

602
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,080
protected from they will come at us by

603
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
attacking our wi-fi

604
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,159
okay the easiest thing they can attack

605
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,200
they will attack and wi-fi is very easy

606
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,039
to attack surely not so we'll see

607
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,480
uh

608
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,320
bruno vogels once said dan's like

609
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,640
nobody's watching encrypt like everyone

610
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,960
is one of my favorite quotes

611
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,840
okay s be paranoid if you turn to me and

612
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,159
say phil you're a little bit paranoid my

613
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,240
response is gonna be thank you

614
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,799
yes i know

615
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,360
spend some time talking to rod and marco

616
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,960
should you be paranoid

617
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,640
yes you should

618
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,080
so what are the foundations of the

619
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,919
operation of wpa and wpa2 that we use

620
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,159
most frequently and most commonly today

621
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,159
so connection to the network

622
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,840
pre-shared key editor 2.1x or radius

623
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
usually just called 1x

624
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,159
and of course the four-way handshake are

625
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,440
the most important primitives we have

626
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
to understand to understand the building

627
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,840
blocks of life

628
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:30,960
okay

629
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,799
so wi-fi operates as a state machine

630
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,039
okay you start off in state number one

631
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,880
you are unauthenticated and you are

632
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
unassociated now we have to stop stop

633
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,559
stop stop

634
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,400
authentication here has got nothing to

635
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
do with security put that out to your

636
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,520
mind

637
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,840
authentication and used to be done with

638
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,640
web with a four-way exchange which was

639
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,559
very insecure

640
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,440
okay

641
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,320
you never ever send

642
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,960
plain text and encrypted text over the

643
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,559
same media

644
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,279
if your response is why go and watch the

645
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,840
movie the imitation game to how the

646
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,440
allies broke

647
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
the nazi enigma machine

648
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,840
uh quite possibly one of the best

649
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,080
encryption mechanisms ever created they

650
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,320
didn't do it properly and they sent the

651
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,679
same words

652
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,279
every day at the same time every morning

653
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,039
they sent the weather report out

654
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,080
okay that allowed the allies to break

655
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,760
the enigma code

656
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,840
because they were working from an

657
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,880
unencrypted set and an encrypted cell

658
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,919
so web had this inherent problem so we

659
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,480
turn off this functionality and

660
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,799
very very simply the first thing we do

661
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,600
is we authenticate okay we turn off

662
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,760
shared authentication knock knock knock

663
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,559
can i come in that's all this is

664
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,880
it's an authentication request followed

665
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,480
by an authentication response that

666
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,240
usually always yes

667
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
so there's no security at the

668
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,480
authentication phase

669
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,200
you are now instead authenticated but

670
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,440
you are unassociated

671
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,600
or your client i should say your client

672
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,360
will now associate

673
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,600
okay all before this

674
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,960
either by looking at beacons or

675
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,520
listening to or sending out pro

676
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,440
you've chosen an access point you

677
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,120
authenticate to the access point knock

678
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,960
knock knock can i come in

679
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,880
you associate to the access point

680
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
association is a big deal you get a

681
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,080
number called your association id

682
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,919
that means you belong to that access

683
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,080
point you can only be associated to one

684
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,559
ap at a time

685
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,960
so here we've got aid number seven

686
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,159
you are now connected to wi-fi

687
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,559
excuse me

688
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,039
you're now connected to wi-fi

689
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,799
and you can now communicate and send

690
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,320
data

691
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,720
typically now we have

692
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,400
what i call

693
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,880
security authentication sometimes i call

694
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,440
this second authentications as a tribute

695
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,840
to hobbit so everybody know what has

696
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,919
second breakfast is okay second

697
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,600
authentications is

698
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,400
okay

699
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,480
and this is where real security takes

700
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,400
place you can turn it off and have no

701
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720
security well if that's the case you

702
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
should really have

703
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,120
a hot spot but a captive portal or some

704
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,039
other forms of protection and this is

705
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,480
usually what you do with a guest network

706
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
at a coffee shop

707
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
guest network at a stadium

708
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,000
okay

709
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,120
uh usually you make the users do an

710
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,480
acceptable use policy enter their email

711
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,320
uh sign in with the username and

712
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,679
password or pay money to buy some tokens

713
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,600
or something but some kind of a hot spot

714
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
or captive portal or if nothing else

715
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
it's a completely open network but a

716
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,200
firewall is put on to restrict what is

717
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200
and what isn't allowed to go through

718
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,720
that network

719
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,120
so it's very restricted don't leave an

720
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,760
open network completely open with no

721
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,080
security on it because you'll have the

722
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,600
fbi knocking on your door if you're

723
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,480
lucky

724
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,960
you'll have an email from your internet

725
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,480
service provider

726
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,360
um

727
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,520
asking why were you downloading illegal

728
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,600
copies of

729
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
spider-man 3

730
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,320
okay please stop doing it if you're very

731
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,159
unlucky you'll have anti-terrorist

732
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,640
squads or

733
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,320
illegal activity squads are knocking on

734
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,080
your doors because the bad people

735
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,000
connected to your network where they

736
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,279
bought the insert problematic thing here

737
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,159
drugs bombs whatever but when they

738
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,640
bought them they used your email

739
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,960
apologies they used your

740
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,200
web

741
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,880
i'm going for a tangent let me start it

742
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,760
again they're using your wi-fi

743
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,159
to get the information okay

744
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,440
sorry i was thinking ahead of my next

745
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,559
thing

746
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,640
run away with myself

747
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
so the best thing you can do of course

748
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,880
is to put some security on put security

749
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,360
on okay and there are really two types

750
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
of security

751
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,080
that you can use today there's personal

752
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,480
we have a pre-shed key

753
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,159
and enterprise

754
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,960
where you have a full-on radius server

755
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,360
and you use

756
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,399
eep.1x type

757
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,240
security

758
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,200
to connect to the wi-fi network

759
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,360
let's be honest

760
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,039
i'm not going to say never

761
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,880
very unlikely that you're gonna have

762
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,760
enterprise radius servers at home

763
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,120
grandma isn't right so pre-shed key is a

764
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,960
very popular

765
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,679
alternative today

766
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,039
now you may say what about wpa or wpa2

767
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,039
whenever to the lmi

768
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,559
came out

769
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,760
okay before that all we had was web

770
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,320
and the wi-fi alliance

771
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,440
had noted that web was becoming weaker

772
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,480
so the wi-fi alliance created wpa with

773
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,520
the tkip protocol running on the rc4

774
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,960
algorithm

775
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,240
to protect and make web better it's

776
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,919
basically

777
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,520
web version 2. no one ever called it

778
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,480
that but it's based on when

779
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,880
then at the 2.11 i came out about a year

780
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
or so later and the wi-fi alliance

781
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,960
immediately transferred the

782
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,520
functionality technology from editor to

783
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,679
119 and came up with wpa2 so wpa2 could

784
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,520
also do backwards compatible and could

785
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
use tk on rc4

786
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,600
and then transition to ccmp and aes

787
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,279
well as of 2014 the wi-fi alliance came

788
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,880
up and said if you want to use tkip

789
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,679
you've got to use wpa if you want to use

790
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,880
wpa2 it's only allowed to use ccmp and

791
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,080
aes

792
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,799
now vendors of course

793
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,720
spend the rules here and you may say

794
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,039
well my vendor allows me sure your

795
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,159
vendor is vendor is breaking the 2014.

796
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,559
that's like eight years ago gang right

797
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,720
they break in the 2014 ruling so they

798
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,440
are not wi-fi alliance compatible

799
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,880
right just be aware

800
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,080
so

801
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,159
when you do personal

802
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,559
appreciate key or enterprise dot one x

803
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,600
radius

804
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,159
is followed by the four way handshake

805
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,799
forward handshake is what gives you your

806
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,840
usable keys on the network only if you

807
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,559
run the four-way handshake are you

808
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,039
secure

809
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
okay

810
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,360
so pre-shed key you have a symmetric key

811
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,640
that is put

812
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
in the form of a passphrase on the

813
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,200
client and what i call the wireless

814
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,600
infrastructure if you have

815
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,320
a comcast or an att wireless router at

816
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,679
home you have a standalone ap if you use

817
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,480
meraki mist

818
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,799
in the office you have a cloud-based

819
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,679
wireless lan control entity if you have

820
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,080
cisco or aruba you may have a wireless

821
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,480
lan controller in your office so i'm

822
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,640
bundling all of these together all forms

823
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,720
of standalone ip cloud controller and

824
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,960
local controllers and bundled together

825
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,559
into the name called the wireless

826
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,559
infrastructure so the wireless

827
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,240
infrastructure

828
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,799
if you if you if that's too complex or

829
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,720
too much to to think about just think

830
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,760
the ap

831
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,120
because the wireless lan controller

832
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,039
sends the information down to the ap

833
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,399
because the ap is under the control of

834
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,159
the controller or the cloud right so

835
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,399
just take ap if you have to the wireless

836
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,159
infrastructure

837
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,159
and the client are told what the

838
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,840
passphrase is

839
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,640
now

840
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,000
the passphrase

841
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,399
may the force be with you let me in

842
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,880
that's not the pre-shed key

843
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,399
the passphrase is next 4096 times

844
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,880
with the ssid

845
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,799
to create what is called the pre-shed

846
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,320
key which is 64 bytes long 512 bits

847
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,640
okay so that's good because that means

848
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,960
if i use let me in you use let me in on

849
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,640
a different ssid we have a different

850
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,799
pre-set key well that's good but that's

851
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,799
about as far as good as it gets

852
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,760
the one thing you need to understand is

853
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
everybody that's using the same

854
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,120
passphrase

855
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,200
with the same ssid so everybody on your

856
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,679
network ends up with the same pre-shed

857
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,600
key it's very important to understand

858
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,679
that that is not good

859
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,039
well i try and keep a straight face

860
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,279
while i say this it's fine as long as

861
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,679
you change the passphrase every 30 days

862
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,440
and you change the passphrase when

863
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,440
somebody leaves your network

864
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,519
no you don't no one does

865
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,840
i don't no one does that's the problem

866
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
with appreciate key right

867
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,519
everybody who's ever connected to your

868
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,679
network with the same passphrase knows

869
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,120
your pre-shed key

870
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,519
so a bit of theory again rewatch the

871
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,640
video if you want to read more about it

872
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,399
i'm not going to go on about this but

873
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,600
the

874
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,360
password based

875
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,919
generation function has been used a lot

876
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,000
throughout the industry

877
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,519
basically what happens it's a pseudo

878
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,960
random function of two parameters

879
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,039
without thought output length

880
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,320
page length

881
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,679
okay

882
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,960
uh so password is the master password

883
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,720
appreciate key

884
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,399
salt is a sequence of bets known as

885
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,000
cryptographic salt

886
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,360
if you haven't guessed it already the

887
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,000
ssid is used as assault oh okay

888
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,440
c is the number of iterations four

889
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,519
thousand and ninety six dk let the

890
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,679
desired bit length the right key and

891
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,679
then dk is the

892
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,840
generated drive key now i did get this

893
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,799
from wikipedia maybe a bit complex one

894
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,399
thing you may

895
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,080
find an argument with me with is the

896
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,399
size of the key okay

897
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,440
the pairwise master key is 256

898
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,880
bits

899
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,919
the

900
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,200
pre-shared key is 512 bits

901
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,760
so sometimes you see 256 written here

902
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,679
that's not

903
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,919
the

904
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,279
pbk df2 output that is the key that we

905
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,120
use in wireless which you'll learn about

906
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,679
in a little while

907
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,720
now it is run 4096 times remember this

908
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
if i'm trying to guess your pre-shed key

909
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,120
i have to do a calculation 4096 times

910
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,760
for every key i guess that slows down

911
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,480
calculations

912
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,760
if you are using wpa2 enterprise you

913
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,240
have a software on the client called the

914
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,640
supplicant it communicates with the

915
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,480
wireless lan infrastructure which is

916
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
called the authenticate tour

917
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,399
it communicates with a radius server

918
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,879
and the radius server is what does the

919
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,159
authentication okay now this little

920
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,679
extra note gear is only here because

921
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,839
typically today people either use a

922
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,280
microsoft

923
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,440
radius server or they have their radio

924
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,839
server access to ice integrated with the

925
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,639
microsoft ad or some other kind of ldap

926
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,719
so users and passwords are no longer

927
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,960
stored on the radius server they may use

928
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,918
an ldap function to go look them up on a

929
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,079
an ldap server

930
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,839
but typically what we care about is the

931
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,639
supplicant the authenticate tor and the

932
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,839
authentication server also known as the

933
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,520
radius and by the way

934
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,639
the authenticator is a pass-through

935
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,000
it is the supplicant and the

936
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,800
authentication server that do the wi-fi

937
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,839
magic but this again tends to be a an

938
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,440
enterprise level functionality you

939
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
probably won't see this on your home

940
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,320
wireless router

941
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,880
that leads us on to the four-way

942
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,320
handshake whether you've used

943
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,440
personal

944
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
to create a pre-shared key

945
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,160
or you've used the dot one x e radius

946
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,400
method to create the output of which

947
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,960
creates a master session key

948
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,880
both of these

949
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,079
if they're larger are shrunk down into a

950
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,839
256 bit

951
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,560
master key now this is the

952
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,680
daddy or the granddaddy of all your keys

953
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,079
kind of everybody using the same key all

954
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,040
the time

955
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,520
so when you use a connection

956
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,359
please understand the output of the

957
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,880
four-way handshake which we'll go

958
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,160
through in a minute

959
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,560
is a pairwise transient key

960
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,599
the pairwise transient key

961
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,359
is the same whether you're using the

962
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,880
passphrase

963
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,760
or

964
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
personal or enterprise now please

965
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,720
understand

966
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,040
this is personal this is enterprise now

967
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,599
we talk about the supplicant client

968
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,760
talking to the authenticator access

969
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,160
point so from this point on we are not

970
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,720
differentiating between personal and

971
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,119
enterprise both of them result in a

972
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,760
pairwise master key

973
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,200
please understand the pairwise master

974
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,359
key may have to be downloaded to the

975
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,119
access point

976
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,920
as a function of the successful finish

977
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,680
of an enterprise authentication

978
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,480
okay

979
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,760
the pairwise transient key guarantees

980
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,920
that every client every time they

981
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,400
connect will have a unique

982
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,200
set of keys

983
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,359
yes they will all have the same pre-shed

984
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,839
key if they are using personnel

985
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,119
yes they will always get a unique

986
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,560
msk

987
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,320
every time the same cloud at the same

988
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,760
time connects disconnect connect

989
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
disconnects connect disconnects connect

990
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,480
disconnects on that first

991
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,160
fourth connect it disconnects you then

992
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,880
connect a fifth time on that fifth

993
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,440
reconnection you have a unique master

994
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,280
session

995
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,720
that's why enterprise is so much

996
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,040
stronger than personal everybody has the

997
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,359
same pre-set key every

998
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,680
if they belong to the same ssid and

999
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,599
they've used the same passphrase that

1000
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,240
means everybody has the same pnk on that

1001
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,200
net

1002
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,400
so what happens with the four-way

1003
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,800
handshake is the access point sends down

1004
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,720
a random number the client then sends up

1005
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,079
a random number the access point

1006
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:32,880
then

1007
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,640
goes to step number three

1008
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,119
the client then said step number four

1009
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,079
okay so at the end of step number two

1010
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,480
the client and the ap

1011
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,480
i've got all the information they need

1012
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,960
to create the pairwise transient key

1013
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,280
they have the pmk

1014
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,040
and they have the supplicant the

1015
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,440
client's random number the authenticator

1016
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,160
the ap's random number the supplicants

1017
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,040
mac address the authenticators

1018
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
so these five things are mixed together

1019
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,599
to create the pairwise translate key

1020
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,280
pairwise transient key is actually split

1021
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,079
up into four parts

1022
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,720
one of them is the cac key one is the

1023
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,000
kck

1024
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,320
key one is the temporal key sometimes

1025
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,720
you see it in documentation as the

1026
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,560
temporal encryption key the tek

1027
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,000
and the fourth one is kind of unused

1028
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,920
i'll say it's unused for those of you

1029
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,680
know better it is actually used to

1030
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
create

1031
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,320
edit2.lmw

1032
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,119
pmf keys to protect against the

1033
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,720
authentication attacks if you're using

1034
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,599
that

1035
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,400
but outside of attitude lmw these keys

1036
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,079
are unused or these values are unused

1037
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,480
so the ap sends out its random number

1038
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,280
the client sends up x random number now

1039
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,200
everybody knows everything they need to

1040
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,000
know

1041
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,640
notice the client when it sends up

1042
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,400
exchange number two

1043
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,200
it has a mik value a mic value is a

1044
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,280
fancy frame check sequence think of it

1045
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,520
as a fancy frame check sequence

1046
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,079
but it's encrypted with the key check

1047
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,119
key

1048
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,520
kck don't get hung up on the or that i

1049
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,760
put these in this is for information the

1050
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,280
order may change

1051
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,200
it's just for information

1052
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,480
so this key the kck key is used to

1053
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,119
encrypt the mic value in exchange two

1054
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,200
three and four

1055
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,040
if any form of man in the middle attack

1056
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,880
goes on

1057
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,040
the mic value will change

1058
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,960
as a result we know if someone is

1059
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,280
messing with us so key exchange two

1060
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,520
three and four is protected from one in

1061
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,320
the middle attacks by the kck

1062
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,560
key

1063
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,760
the whole purpose remember i told you

1064
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,160
was to get a unique pairwise transient

1065
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,240
key which is a unique temporal key but

1066
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,000
if everybody's got a unique temporary

1067
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,200
key how do we send the broadcast packet

1068
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,400
oh so there needs to be a broadcast key

1069
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,480
so the broadcast key is generated by the

1070
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,320
access point usually the first time the

1071
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,240
first client connects

1072
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,960
and is sent encrypted by the key

1073
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,680
encryption key in exchange number three

1074
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,119
also protected by a mic mikvah

1075
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,119
so here's my mac address because my mac

1076
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,599
address is protected here's the

1077
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,839
broadcast key it's protected yep we're

1078
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,240
good it's protected key exchange number

1079
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,800
four is roger dodger we are good let's

1080
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,400
do it

1081
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,960
now if ever you find a situation

1082
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,359
where the four-way handshake fails

1083
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,960
after exchange number two

1084
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,720
that is where

1085
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,160
the access point on receiving the frame

1086
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,079
calculates the mic

1087
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,480
of the frame using x

1088
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,920
kck

1089
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,079
if it's not the same

1090
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,240
either the data has been changed or

1091
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,640
you're using a different passphrase

1092
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,200
so the four-way handshake will drop at

1093
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,280
handshake number two so if you see the

1094
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,359
four-way handshake constantly dropping

1095
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,680
at exchange number two probably put in

1096
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,839
the wrong password

1097
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,480
and wi-fi

1098
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,560
need to be a minimum of eight double

1099
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,640
check uppercase lowercase

1100
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,279
blah blah blah

1101
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,200
okay

1102
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,920
as mentioned if you use edited.1x e

1103
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,680
radius

1104
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,960
during the connection phase the radius

1105
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,160
server will download its certificate to

1106
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
you the client

1107
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,240
you must have validate certificate

1108
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,079
turned on and you must have a key

1109
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,680
present or you must have a certificate

1110
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,720
present containing a key a public key

1111
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,200
that will be used to validate

1112
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,040
the certificate that was just sent down

1113
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,119
to you by the radius server

1114
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,359
editor.1x

1115
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,760
radius is only

1116
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,920
secure it is way more secure than

1117
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,359
preschett

1118
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,920
it is only secure if you have a valid

1119
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,440
certificate checked and you've installed

1120
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,880
the certificate

1121
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,560
oh i think maybe i'll unselect this film

1122
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,319
because i got a problem

1123
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,960
that would be a very very foolish thing

1124
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,839
to do

1125
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,200
you never

1126
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,520
ever

1127
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,599
uncheck that box and you tell all your

1128
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,480
users if ever the client gets a message

1129
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,960
saying hey this service this server

1130
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,000
certificate seems invalid do you want to

1131
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,119
continue

1132
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,040
the response is no

1133
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,640
as in luke i am your father no

1134
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,480
really really no

1135
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,400
okay

1136
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,040
you can't break into the one x

1137
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,000
deep

1138
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,520
radius

1139
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,720
but you can break it with a stupid user

1140
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
okay there's an old hack i used to show

1141
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,079
in my classes

1142
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,880
where i used to use an old old android

1143
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,839
phone

1144
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,560
and i do the hack on my new android

1145
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,800
phone and my iphone and i become a big

1146
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,920
red alarm going alarm alarm certificate

1147
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,240
is invalid alarm do you want to continue

1148
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,640
and of course you say no but on the old

1149
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,680
old android android you connect and the

1150
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,920
little in the corner of the page right

1151
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,520
in the corner of the page down here

1152
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,800
there's a little message saying in

1153
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,520
parentheses are they readable stuff gets

1154
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,599
invalid do you want to continue and of

1155
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,400
course a user goes sure

1156
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,760
and now you've allowed nasty hacker into

1157
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,200
the exchange

1158
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,839
okay so as long as you validate

1159
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,160
certificate and you you can set a group

1160
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,720
policy now i believe on microsoft and

1161
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
other policies on androids and iphones

1162
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,040
and tablets and things today where if

1163
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,319
the certificate is ever invalid it stops

1164
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,640
and does not let a stupid user say

1165
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,040
continue and again i'm saying stupid

1166
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,280
user because that is a very bad thing to

1167
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,160
do

1168
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,359
okay do not allow your users to say yeah

1169
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,960
yeah yeah i know the stuff gets valid

1170
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,000
but we'll continue it

1171
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,319
so as long as you stay within the

1172
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,920
constraints of this

1173
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,359
when the radius

1174
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,599
server downloads its certificate just

1175
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,640
like standard ssl and tls the client

1176
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,839
uses that certificate to exchange data

1177
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,040
via an asymmetric key tunnel to create

1178
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,280
symmetric keys that will be used in the

1179
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,640
continuation

1180
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,160
of

1181
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,520
the

1182
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,359
authentication to the radius server and

1183
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,560
the

1184
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,560
other bits that go on up until you get

1185
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,880
the yes you are authenticated and then

1186
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,560
you do the standard four-way handshake

1187
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,920
really today you're going to be using

1188
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,319
kylie linux try linux is a pen testers

1189
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,760
best friend hacker's best friend

1190
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,880
whatever

1191
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,280
wi-fi operation is very easy to do on

1192
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,839
2.4 gigahertz more difficult to do on

1193
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,200
five gigas

1194
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,480
especially ac phil what about ax

1195
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,040
i haven't heard of any yet what about

1196
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,680
six stop what about six gigahertz stop

1197
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,640
no knocking out for a long time okay the

1198
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,160
problem is we've got to get the silicon

1199
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,359
that does it

1200
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,720
then we've got to get the drivers

1201
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,200
written for kali linux

1202
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,640
so chipsets ralink realtek atheros and

1203
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,760
intel

1204
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,359
uh i i like to use raw link personally

1205
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,280
and i can show you the devices i'm using

1206
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,319
if you're interested

1207
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,560
uh uh most of my devils will be done on

1208
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,599
2.4 but i do have a five gig units one

1209
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,119
which are going to sell out very quickly

1210
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,560
on ebay once i announce what they are

1211
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,160
uh and they are just beautiful little

1212
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,839
devices that will do five difference

1213
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,200
yeah craig shorts devices so

1214
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,880
um my

1215
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,200
my first one is

1216
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,240
a little uh panda wireless the second

1217
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,400
one is this little guy if you can see it

1218
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,760
now it's not the guy with the big

1219
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,680
antennas on i haven't got him working

1220
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,640
yet uh i got announcement from um hack

1221
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,160
five that

1222
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,480
this

1223
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,760
usb will work with the pineapple version

1224
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,960
7

1225
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,240
which i'm assuming there's got to be

1226
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,720
linux drivers for so i bought one i also

1227
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,359
bought the pineapple 7 adapter as well i

1228
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,800
bought this i tried to get it worked and

1229
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,880
i not succeeded yet but this is the guy

1230
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,800
i don't know if you can see it

1231
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,280
the link says

1232
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,200
it's uh it's a linksys

1233
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,119
dual band

1234
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,200
linksys

1235
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,560
i'm not going to unplug it i'll tell you

1236
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,040
later i think it's the 600n or something

1237
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,520
i'll get the exact part name later uh

1238
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,160
it's exactly the same driver as the 2.4

1239
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,839
gigahertz one i use

1240
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,680
so it's swap compatible between the usb

1241
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,640
2.4 panda wireless 10 bucks or something

1242
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,000
on amazon

1243
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,920
it's the same one if you go to a hack 5

1244
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,000
website and you buy the hack 5

1245
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,640
adapter it's the same one that they have

1246
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,240
i i'll unplug it

1247
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,160
i'll have a break in a minute for q a

1248
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,079
and i'll unplug and give you the exact

1249
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,240
part number you can't buy them anymore

1250
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,760
but they every now and again somebody

1251
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,680
puts them on ebay for somewhere between

1252
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,640
20 and 50 bucks

1253
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,040
i usually grab them very quickly because

1254
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,480
they're a great

1255
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,960
wi-fi adapter to use the kali linux that

1256
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,119
supports five gigahertz it's n only

1257
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,040
right they're not looking at ac but you

1258
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,119
can do five gigahertz captures

1259
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,440
one thing you have to understand with

1260
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,280
wi-fi is

1261
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,640
if you've ever used wireshark with

1262
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,119
ethernet you know all about promiscuous

1263
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,760
move okay promiscuous mode is not good

1264
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,000
enough in wi-fi

1265
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,520
you have to have

1266
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,119
monitor mode it's another level

1267
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,280
sorry microsoft people microsoft does

1268
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,520
not let you put their drivers in monitor

1269
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,240
period now before all you

1270
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,440
apple people get too smug

1271
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,680
apple do not let you put the iphone and

1272
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,280
the ipad drivers in monitor mode either

1273
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,640
so

1274
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,280
me as a let's say a wi-fi hacker a wi-fi

1275
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,559
pen tester

1276
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,599
has an apple macbook pro

1277
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,520
and an android

1278
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,079
samsung s21 they are the tools that i

1279
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,200
carry with me when i do wi-fi work uh

1280
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
looking at signal strength because

1281
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
because the android phone has great

1282
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,000
utilities and the macbook

1283
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,960
pro

1284
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,559
has

1285
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:21,520
um

1286
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,920
the ability to capture traffic now

1287
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,559
there is a problem with the new macbook

1288
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,000
m1s

1289
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,839
where there is a corruption somewhere in

1290
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,200
the apple stack

1291
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,520
it works fine for wireless traffic when

1292
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,480
you capture traffic on the apple stack

1293
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,160
that can be a corruption that takes

1294
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,680
place and the

1295
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,640
uh

1296
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,200
your wireshark tells you it's a beacon

1297
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,280
frame when it's appropriate

1298
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,640
uh that appears to be fixed in the new

1299
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,960
m1 macbook

1300
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,440
what is the m1 max pros and things the

1301
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,000
new m1 processors don't seem to have

1302
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,920
that problem if you've got an intel

1303
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,359
macbook you're gonna have a problem

1304
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,800
anyway but it's uh it's a problem where

1305
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,319
um well

1306
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,000
all the capture utilities i use

1307
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,839
they all have the same problem where on

1308
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,559
the on the original m1 macbook pro on

1309
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,200
the macbook mini the mac mini

1310
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,720
there was a corruption that happened in

1311
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,640
the stack somewhere but if you've got a

1312
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,880
newer macbook

1313
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,800
pro or a mac mini or whatever then that

1314
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,640
what i do at the moment is that is no

1315
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,280
longer a problem is there a thousand

1316
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,839
people i know in the wi-fi community

1317
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,599
group and

1318
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,680
we kept saying hey apple it doesn't work

1319
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,680
and

1320
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,280
apple never responded we're like oh

1321
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,559
we'll fix that now because there's a

1322
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,160
thousand people that care about it right

1323
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,760
i'm not being mean to apple i love apple

1324
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,760
don't get me wrong but um

1325
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,480
we told apple about it

1326
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,480
and it's fixed in the new model so maybe

1327
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,079
they did take notice

1328
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,559
problem solved

1329
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,559
so again capturing with microsoft is

1330
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,079
very difficult that's why we use kali

1331
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,000
linux so you can capture with carrier

1332
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,520
next and view it

1333
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,280
in

1334
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,200
microsoft wireshark or apple watch

1335
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,720
you got to get used to these guys

1336
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,599
these guys are the go-to wireless

1337
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,319
utilities in kali linux

1338
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,359
for working with wi-fi

1339
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,720
yeah i crack ng suite

1340
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,000
uh you need to know what chipset is

1341
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,119
being used

1342
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,000
you can use linux utilities m1ng is the

1343
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,440
easiest tool to use to see what

1344
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,520
chipsets and drivers are being used

1345
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,160
uh here's a command you can type in

1346
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,000
you've got to make sure you connect not

1347
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,839
connected to wi-fi

1348
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:48,800
okay

1349
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,599
load up your kali linux plug in the usb

1350
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,359
type in air replay ng tap tap test

1351
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,960
wireless lan zero if you've got a

1352
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,480
message back that says injection is

1353
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,960
working you know that that card

1354
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,720
it will work with

1355
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,200
kali linux now just because a card works

1356
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,040
with kali linux

1357
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,760
for connecting the wi-fi doesn't mean it

1358
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,319
will work with kali linux and will work

1359
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,319
with aircrack ng

1360
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,280
so

1361
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,200
test it make sure that

1362
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,079
aircrack ng tools will work on it by

1363
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,720
getting again packet injection working

1364
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,559
so this is a test to prove that packet

1365
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,280
injection is good

1366
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,680
you don't get this message your wireless

1367
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,800
adapter is probably not compatible with

1368
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,319
a lot of the wi-fi hacking tools

1369
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,720
all right

1370
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,240
did you want to stop the recording there

1371
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,720

1377
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,280

1380
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,280
i stopped the recording

1381
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,640
excellent

1382
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,800
so do you see any questions

1383
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,240
give me a second do you guys have any

1384
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,160
questions for him before we continue

1385
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,880
like the people in the room

1386
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,119
who actually do sure

1387
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,160
we have a question so so

1388
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,520
i feel like you're staying closer

1389
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,160
considering what yeah

1390
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,400
so i've been having weird compute

1391
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
yeah computer activity i'm not asking

1392
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,640
you to deal with that that'd be silly

1393
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,440
i've tried looking through wireshark

1394
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,319
it's a microsoft and

1395
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,800
when i noticed that i couldn't even see

1396
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,119
my own web searches

1397
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,359
so you said that monitor mode it was

1398
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:17,359
needed for it and not promiscuous

1399
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,800
not just for wi-fi so promiscuous mode

1400
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
on

1401
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,160
promiscuous mode works fine on microsoft

1402
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,599
for ethernet captures but for for wi-fi

1403
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,200
captures

1404
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
if you're using wi-fi you need monitor

1405
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,480
mode so if you're trying to if you're

1406
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,920
doing something on microsoft

1407
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,160
with wi-fi and you're like i'm going to

1408
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,400
capture my traffic and see what happens

1409
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,880
you're not going to well you should

1410
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,040
capture your own traffic

1411
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,160
but it won't

1412
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,079
but when when we when we want to

1413
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,319
troubleshoot our hack wi-fi we need to

1414
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,359
see all wi-fi traffic going by us not

1415
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,520
just the communication between

1416
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,119
our device

1417
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,880
and

1418
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,720
the ap so you should see your own

1419
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,680
traffic

1420
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,599
so that's a different problem but i'll

1421
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:06,960
run into that problem later when i'm

1422
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,839
doing something important

1423
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,319
right i'm done

1424
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,160
anyone else has another question those

1425
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,480
slides will be available yes

1426
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,480
slides yes okay

1427
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,200
no

1428
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,800
sites the slides will not be available

1429
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,040
sorry the video will be available but

1430
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,520
not the slides slides are copyright nc

1431
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,960
expert

1432
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,160
okay

1433
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,599
um

1434
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,119
i have a question

1435
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,240
can

1436
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,760
do i need to deal with this

1437
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,640
okay

1438
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,280
um well okay this kind of a side

1439
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,960
question um

1440
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,400
i was wondering for home use

1441
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:42,790
um

1442
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:44,079
[Music]

1443
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,799
assume all factors are equal in terms of

1444
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,200
encryption and protocol

1445
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,880
um

1446
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,559
isn't it

1447
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,559
why would it be better if you have

1448
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,200
stronger wi-fi you know now they sell

1449
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,040
really expensive

1450
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,640
um

1451
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,599
uh

1452
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,119
you know um

1453
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,119
what wi-fi uh

1454
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,079
routers and so i was thinking if you

1455
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,640
have one that is sufficient it's good

1456
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,400
enough you don't need to

1457
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,640
have it that long of a distance because

1458
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,160
it just allowed

1459
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,720
hackers to access to you

1460
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,559
right you said that if um if the hackers

1461
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,760
um

1462
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,160
can can increase the gain they can have

1463
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,960
you as far as half a mile

1464
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,640
so if your signal is is only good enough

1465
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,680
like within your fence and not like

1466
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,040
like the like the more expensive wi-fi

1467
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,040
router that you buy

1468
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,680
it

1469
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,839
it amplified the signal right so that

1470
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,240
you get more but if it's sufficient

1471
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,839
enough for your distance you don't need

1472
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:49,520
longer than your yard

1473
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,920
yeah yes

1474
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,400
i can hack you from further away because

1475
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,280
i've got a better antenna so so with the

1476
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,119
reason you want to buy a new

1477
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,599
access point or a wi-fi router the

1478
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,040
reason you want to buy it is because of

1479
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,680
what it does security wise

1480
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,880
not

1481
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,040
because it covers better

1482
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,960
a a lot of people focus on you're

1483
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,799
absolutely right a lot of people focus

1484
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,640
on coverage of the a of the the wi-fi

1485
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,720
then they should focus on the security

1486
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,200
of the life

1487
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,440
that's why you should upgrade so so if

1488
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,640
you have an ap or a wi-fi router that

1489
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,200
meets your coverage requirements

1490
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,440
you need to upgrade it because it does

1491
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,119
not meet your secure security

1492
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,240
requirements

1493
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,599
and if it does meet your security

1494
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,440
requirements by the end of this talk you

1495
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,920
may want to revise them

1496
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,280
okay yeah and also uh for

1497
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,040
again it's not on the schedule but what

1498
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,040
i'm gonna do is i'm gonna show you

1499
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,079
with a

1500
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,359
you know uh

1501
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,680
high-end product you know security

1502
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,839
product how you can over you know

1503
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,079
defend from from from this attack right

1504
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,520
because

1505
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,960
on his next slide i'm pretty sure he's

1506
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,559
gonna talk about it but

1507
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,200
uh why um

1508
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,440
wi-fi is hackable with the pressure

1509
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,839
cases which again you use those tools

1510
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,280
that he's going to show you

1511
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,440
um to hack it and it's very easy you can

1512
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,400
create an antenna with with uh

1513
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,520
cans from um you know like the fruit can

1514
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,200
like food cans you can create an antenna

1515
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,280
some stuff like that and like he was

1516
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,720
saying you can

1517
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,720
i can be here and your your wi-fi is

1518
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,720
over there i can create something that

1519
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,119
literally as as

1520
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,559
as long as i point it to the right

1521
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,559
direction i'll be able to get your

1522
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,359
your signal okay but that doesn't mean

1523
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,440
depending on what you have what type of

1524
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,520
infrastructure you have i might be able

1525
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,240
to pack it or not that's the difference

1526
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,520
right right

1527
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,480
but

1528
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,079
let's say there are two people over

1529
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,440
there one has a stronger

1530
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,680
wi-fi router than the other

1531
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,920
then you'll be able it's easier for you

1532
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,480
to access the one with the stronger

1533
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,920
at that point doesn't matter because i

1534
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,720
can

1535
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,280
uh i've seen projects where

1536
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,280
they they do like two miles

1537
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,599
yeah so it's possible oh yeah for

1538
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,520
military purposes

1539
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,599
and they go further too so i'm just

1540
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:20,839
saying like yeah

1541
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,680
yeah but i'm saying at home

1542
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,799
okay so so uh what i got from him was

1543
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,160
from phil was that

1544
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,200
um it's better to work on the protocol

1545
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,040
because then then the the

1546
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,880
uh the signal strength if it's

1547
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,480
sufficient for you

1548
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,960
you don't need to go five houses away

1549
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,000
right right

1550
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,599
yeah i'm gonna discuss that later

1551
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,000
because i i think you're gonna see it

1552
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,839
you know how you can protect yourself so

1553
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,400
yeah uh so go ahead continue phil okay

1554
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,720
thank you

1555
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,160
now here we go here it is

1556
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,440
so i i just checked with my um

1557
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,280
ceo quickly

1558
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,599
a clarification i can give you a pdf of

1559
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,200
the slides marco

1560
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,880
okay so

1561
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,119
so people can get a copy of the slides

1562
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,520
in pdf format that's fine we'll give you

1563
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,440
i'll send it to you to you or rod and

1564
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,280
then you can distribute it or put it

1565
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,119
wherever people get access to it but it

1566
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,200
won't be the slides but it will be a pdf

1567
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,599
of the slides yep yep that works thank

1568
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,359
you yeah

1569
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,040
uh right you need to restart the

1570
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,799
recording

1571
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,680
uh it's it's past right now

1572
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,960
yeah if you want to restart it then

1573
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,079
please go ahead okay

1574
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,640
so i

1575
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,040
i don't see

1576
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,400
is it recording

1577
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,559
it is right now yes excellent

1578
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,839
thank you sir all right

1579
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,319
so what's wrong with wi-fi then okay

1580
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,359
so

1581
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,040
yeah but isn't it wi-fi is over 15 years

1582
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,319
old

1583
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:05,599
okay it's vulnerable to

1584
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:08,240
de-authentication attacks

1585
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,040
let's imagine that you're

1586
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,520
doing a team with your manager

1587
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,240
and your manager's called ball right

1588
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,359
and

1589
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,440
you are doing something you're playing

1590
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,119
paintball in a forest

1591
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,440
and bob is shouting instructions to you

1592
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,559
okay

1593
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,559
what's stopping me

1594
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,400
standing up do an impersonation of bob

1595
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,720
and say it's bob yeah everybody put your

1596
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,079
weapons down

1597
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,680
and you're all like okay and you all put

1598
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,040
your weapons down

1599
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,640
red team wins

1600
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,799
okay that's exactly what the problem is

1601
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,000
in wi-fi

1602
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,640
i can say i'm your access point but i

1603
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,160
can say hey you

1604
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,680
the authenticate and you're like oh okay

1605
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,240
and there's nothing to stop that

1606
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,720
okay i well surely surely you'll notice

1607
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,880
the mac address right but i can spoof

1608
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,119
your mac address i can spool for the

1609
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,880
authentication to make it look like it's

1610
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,280
coming from your wireless router now

1611
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,680
whenever i use the word access point

1612
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,640
okay

1613
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,799
if you don't work in wi-fi you may call

1614
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,200
them wireless routers okay so at home

1615
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,880
you have a wireless router in the office

1616
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,760
we have our wireless whatever you call

1617
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,440
them it's the same thing a wireless

1618
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,200
router is a

1619
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,280
plastic box with an access point built

1620
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,680
in that's all so access point or

1621
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,839
wireless router for this context of the

1622
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,079
same thing i can spoof

1623
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,000
to make it look like the message is

1624
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,119
coming

1625
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,359
from your

1626
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,000
wireless router or access point hey

1627
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,960
quick and if you just saw a strange head

1628
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,520
appear above me that's like this dog i

1629
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,760
have sat over there on which my hat sits

1630
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,440
so don't think that i'm haunted by like

1631
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,880
some kind of dog

1632
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,160
monster

1633
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,680
but if i put my head in the wrong place

1634
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,520
i don't know if you saw it i just saw it

1635
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,599
above me suddenly appear

1636
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,200
it's a very intelligent dog with the way

1637
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,119
i practice all my

1638
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,240
webinars and talks on on him so he's uh

1639
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,640
he's wireless certified n plus s plus

1640
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,240
all of them

1641
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,680
all right so i can also do

1642
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,200
attacks

1643
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,960
against

1644
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,880
your password

1645
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,440
and the thing i can do here is i can do

1646
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,960
this attack

1647
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,559
from my house i can come to your

1648
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,599
place of business sit outside your house

1649
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,119
capture your stuff as long as i capture

1650
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:27,359
your four-way handshake

1651
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:30,559
i can take that capture away with me

1652
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,640
and i can attack

1653
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,039
i'm actually attacking your password

1654
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,119
your passphrase

1655
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,079
okay

1656
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,280
once i

1657
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,000
once i do the attack and i know your

1658
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,799
pre-shared key i own your network

1659
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:48,240
now if it's your home wi-fi network

1660
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,920
that can have problems if it's the

1661
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,200
corporate

1662
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,720
iot onboarding wi-fi network you have

1663
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,559
huge problems

1664
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:57,680
okay

1665
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,039
wpa2 will happily let you not use

1666
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,119
security coffee shops guest networks

1667
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,520
psk can be an easy minimum of eight

1668
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,240
characters so that's an allowable

1669
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,480
passphrase

1670
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,280
and of course crack came along and broke

1671
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,079
wpa2

1672
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:20,079
so crack was the key reinstallation

1673
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,039
attacks okay

1674
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,720
and i i must point out joy that this

1675
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,079
this was not so much of a problem

1676
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,079
with wpa2 itself but it was the way that

1677
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,000
vendors implemented wpa2

1678
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,520
uh

1679
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,960
it happens a little bit too often i'm

1680
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,280
afraid vendors don't take as much care

1681
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,039
as they should and

1682
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,280
all of them are guilty of this

1683
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,760
vendors did a poor implementation of

1684
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,760
wpa2

1685
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,799
okay

1686
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:55,920
and

1687
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,319
crack took advantage of that and made

1688
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:00,480
wpa2

1689
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,359
very

1690
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:02,960
very

1691
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,119
more easily attackable by making them

1692
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,760
reuse these so that a nonce a number

1693
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,359
that's used once

1694
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,599
it's supposed to be used once

1695
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,280
so reusing a nonce is inherently a huge

1696
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,640
problem right because it's not supposed

1697
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,240
to be allowed

1698
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,599
but crack

1699
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,960
would break wpa2 by forcing non reuse

1700
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,880
okay so this really was a death knell

1701
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,599
for wpa2 first of all people didn't

1702
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:34,400
trust wpa2 so much anymore and secondly

1703
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,920
vendors immediately

1704
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,400
fixed these leaks as it were but the

1705
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,200
damage was down

1706
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,119
so surely it's not that easy to break

1707
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,280
right

1708
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,400
it takes years to break right

1709
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,200
nope

1710
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,359
if you just happen to have an ethereum

1711
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,039
miner that you don't use anymore because

1712
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,640
you know it doesn't cover the cost of

1713
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,880
the electricity that it uses anymore and

1714
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,760
you convert it over to a

1715
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,720
windows based

1716
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,640
cracking tool

1717
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,480
it's very very

1718
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,760
interesting

1719
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,839
so i'm going to show you a demonstration

1720
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,079
of kraken

1721
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:16,960
i created an ssid called it's called

1722
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,319
psk1

1723
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:21,280
and i call i got one called psk2 and i

1724
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,440
do a demonstration of a dictionary

1725
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,200
attack dictionary attack is where you're

1726
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,760
going to attack it using a dictionary of

1727
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,079
words now the words may be password one

1728
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:32,640
two three it's a dictionary of phrases

1729
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,240
it's a better way

1730
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,720
now the key point to understand if the

1731
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,839
past word the past phrase is not in the

1732
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:42,400
dictionary it will never be successful

1733
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,599
if you want to go through every

1734
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,000
character combination that's a brute

1735
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,319
force attack okay that's a lot more

1736
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,280
conflict intensive so what i do in the

1737
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,280
demo usually is i demonstrate

1738
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,559
doing

1739
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,000
the password attack from the dictionary

1740
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,200
using a

1741
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,680
word or a phrase that's

1742
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,280
700 words in the 9 million diction word

1743
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,760
dictionary and it takes about two

1744
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,960
minutes

1745
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,839
and then i show you that i i

1746
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:14,720
run

1747
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,280
the same attack on psk2

1748
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,200
where the word is seven million words in

1749
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,000
the dictionary and it takes like 12 18

1750
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,680
hours okay

1751
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,520
i run

1752
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,599
the dictionary attack

1753
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,520
on this device

1754
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,000
with the same dictionary and it took and

1755
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,880
it took to get the second key

1756
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,200
it took 0.27 seconds

1757
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,920
it literally what it literally went

1758
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,640
loading initializes the graphics cards

1759
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,079
it downloaded a portion of the search

1760
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:48,319
space to each of the graphics cards

1761
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:49,920
and then it starts up

1762
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,119
and it goes

1763
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,760
here's the passphrase and i saw it it

1764
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,960
took five minutes to do the

1765
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,400
initialization chug chug chug chug

1766
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,400
chug chug

1767
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,079
and i i got up and went to get a coffee

1768
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:03,760
when i came back it had stopped i

1769
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,760
thought it was crashed

1770
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,280
and it was like no other passwords can

1771
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,200
be one two three naught point two it

1772
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,880
took 0.27 seconds of processing

1773
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,640
but it took

1774
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,119
seven minutes to initialize it longer to

1775
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,920
initialize than it did to

1776
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,240
um

1777
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:24,799
run the actual

1778
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,079
dictionary attack

1779
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,680
have you ever done a brute force attack

1780
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,760
with it yes i load it up

1781
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,000
the same i i used a password that wasn't

1782
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,839
in the dictionary i think i use cisco

1783
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,839
one two three or something

1784
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,000
and um i said all right

1785
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,359
believe it or not cisco worked this way

1786
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,680
wasn't dictionary at that time uh i ran

1787
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,960
it and it said i'm going through

1788
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,480
i actually told you to go to every

1789
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,079
combination it said it was gonna take a

1790
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,880
long time i then told it five alphabetic

1791
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,319
three numeric and it said he was gonna

1792
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,839
take three hours

1793
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:56,559
of brute force and i then ran it on i

1794
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:59,359
made an alphabetic only like

1795
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:03,039
cisco cisco cisco says lowercase and it

1796
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:04,240
said he was going to take an afternoon

1797
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,200
to do it

1798
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,280
so that goes back to the longer is good

1799
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,400
longer and more complex is even better

1800
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,280
okay

1801
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,479
so when i made it cisco one two three

1802
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,399
it took like

1803
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,679
a week

1804
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:20,880
because i told you to go through

1805
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,120
uppercase lowercase and numeric and it's

1806
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,479
going to take like a week or two weeks

1807
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,158
or something to go through the entire

1808
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,960
space of eight characters now the lesson

1809
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,238
there is is don't have an eight

1810
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,040
character fast phrase right

1811
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,319
have a long password

1812
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,000
but right okay so you capture the data

1813
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,359
um

1814
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,399
you did it phil you do this for a living

1815
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:48,399
it's really hard

1816
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,839
normal fork can't do this

1817
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:54,399
right nope not true

1818
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,679
i don't know if anyone remembers but

1819
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:59,920
i did a talk i think it was it was a

1820
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,399
while back way before kobe on the puna

1821
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:03,679
gachi

1822
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:06,560
punegachi is based on the tamagotchi and

1823
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,799
it's got this cute little face

1824
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,560
here i got it wide open

1825
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,560
mounted on a usb so i can just plug it

1826
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,880
into a usb battery there are prettier

1827
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,960
cases for this but i like this one

1828
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,679
and what what the puna gachi does is you

1829
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:24,000
keep it alive by feeding it

1830
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
four-way handshakes

1831
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,399
okay so what it does if it sees a

1832
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:30,238
four-way handshake go by

1833
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,359
it captures it and logs it to a local

1834
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,759
storage area so it captures 4-way

1835
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,719
hunting so i can walk around anywhere i

1836
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,238
want with this little guy in a battery

1837
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:41,520
pack

1838
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,120
in my

1839
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,319
backpack

1840
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,279
capturing four-way handshakes

1841
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:50,880
so capture the four handshake pnk id

1842
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,799
stores them as a pcap

1843
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:56,320
now it will try and associate to ssids

1844
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,960
and it will use ai to learn how to get

1845
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,600
better now be careful if you do use one

1846
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,400
of these

1847
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,679
uh babies

1848
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,920
okay

1849
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,320
they've got they've got nice mode and

1850
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,120
they've got no keyboard a nice sword

1851
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,760
they capture four-way handshakes

1852
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,280
in naughty mode they try and associate

1853
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,880
and if they see

1854
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,159
communication go by

1855
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,920
they see communication go by

1856
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,600
they will go

1857
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,840
and they will

1858
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,040
de-authenticate client they'll send out

1859
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,199
a broadcast the authentication attack

1860
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:34,640
the authenticating people in your

1861
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,360
vicinity so you may what not want to do

1862
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,840
that work at the dmv

1863
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,400
police station government buildings

1864
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,520
military bases airports and so on so

1865
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,719
forth right

1866
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:48,640
now there's a flag you can put in to

1867
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,520
tell your punagachi to be kind don't be

1868
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,280
nice don't be mean

1869
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,080
okay

1870
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,560
don't be a meanie

1871
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,960
if you do that the funnagachi will not

1872
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,280
start attacking the networks

1873
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,400
but it will still capture the networks

1874
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,679
now i'm sure there's a

1875
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,520
there's a separate conversation we need

1876
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,040
to have that if you're near a military

1877
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,040
base or if you're at the airport and

1878
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,640
you're capturing the four-way handshake

1879
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,640
well they broadcast it

1880
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,239
and nonetheless the judge will see it

1881
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,040
the same way so i personally would not

1882
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,560
have this turned on

1883
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,400
anywhere

1884
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,920
not even like an irs tax

1885
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,000
dmv social security office i just

1886
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,280
wouldn't do it

1887
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,960
don't don't mess around with things

1888
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,400
right

1889
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,199
but

1890
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,920
you can just simply have this on you

1891
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,480
no one's gonna care okay

1892
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,719
no one's going to know what you're doing

1893
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:47,120
unless you start

1894
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,199
de-authenticating if you have the

1895
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,480
authenticate

1896
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,040
turn on

1897
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,360
wireless intrusion protection systems

1898
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,360
were light up like a christmas tree and

1899
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,880
if you if you've gone to the expense of

1900
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,960
having a whips you've probably gone to

1901
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,760
the expense of having a whips location

1902
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,080
so they'll be like that guy in that area

1903
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,600
over there someone in that area over

1904
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,520
there is doing the authentication

1905
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,920
attacks

1906
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,960
so here's where you go gonna have a look

1907
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,080
at it

1908
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,679
i did a talk it was back in 2020

1909
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:34,800
[Music]

1910
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,840
i go

1911
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,520
someone just started talking for a

1912
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,719
reason i don't know why i didn't kind of

1913
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,400
just came through okay

1914
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,040
i think it was may 2020 but there's the

1915
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,960
link to it just go to pacific hackers

1916
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,280
and look up kunagachi or phil morgan and

1917
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,840
you'll find it

1918
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,120
all right so this might be a good time

1919
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,480
to do a quick demo

1920
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,120
to see how easy is it to break a

1921
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,800
password

1922
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,400
um

1923

[Music]

1924
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,400
marco do you want to stop the recording

1925
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,760
for a minute please

1926
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,000
sure

1927
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,480
marco

1928
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:17,280
maybe i preempted that too much

1929
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,600
i don't see my screen sharing do you see

1930
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,120
my screen sharing

1931
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,760
it's it's black

1932
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,920
oh hold on it might be me it might be

1933
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,840
because i

1934
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,480
yeah yeah i said sure vmware and i

1935
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,239
didn't have vmware as the forefront all

1936
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:32,960
right

1937
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,320
so

1938
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,800
i have a network called

1939
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,840
psk1 which is a little network i take

1940
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,760
with me and i do demonstrations

1941
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,360
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

1942
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,360
attack psk1

1943
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,040
okay well first of all

1944
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,440
i want to show you m on ng

1945
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,640
will show me what devices i have

1946
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,679
available i have now

1947
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,480
i'm gonna just simply unplug them and

1948
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,840
plug them back in

1949
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,080
because that's a lot easier

1950
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,840
this is a good time for me to unplug my

1951
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,600
so this link says that i'm talking about

1952
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,880
is the linksys w u s

1958
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,440
in november

1959
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,840
and what you see is

1960
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,560
i noticed

1961
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,719
i'm gonna connect it to linux

1962
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,400
and i'm gonna slide in two other little

1963
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,199
devices as well

1964
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:51,199
these are just 2.4 gig

1965
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:52,800
now they should come out a bit quick a

1966
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,640
bit quicker it does take a little while

1967
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,320
we'll just sit here and be patient and

1968
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,559
wait

1969
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,280
for anyone that's going to try and do

1970
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,159
this

1971
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:06,320
error 110 is a good thing that means

1972
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,239
it's starting to

1973
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,640
work it out that probably means one of

1974
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:15,199
them is present or very soon it will be

1975
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,040
this is not typical i don't know why my

1976
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,040
my

1977
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,000
my kali linux in my vm on my apple

1978
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,840
always takes a long time i have kali

1979
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,719
linux installed on a raspberry pi 4 and

1980
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:35,040
it's instantaneous

1981
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,199
there you go so you can see now

1982
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,880
that it's loaded up

1983
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,400
the adapter

1984
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,040
and that you can see the driver

1985
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,880
that's used it's a very common driver

1986
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,840
and there's the actual model

1987
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,360
of the device

1988
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,520
that i always scoop up i see them on

1989
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,560
ebay

1990
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,400
because it gives me five gigahertz as

1991
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,600
well as 2.4 the other two devices i'm

1992
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,480
gonna

1993
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,599
load up in a minute

1994
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,800
are

1995
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,480
2.4 only

1996
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,159
but notice

1997
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:11,280
they're using the exact same driver

1998
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,239
which is lovely right

1999
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,600
so this is actually an rd2870

2000
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,080
and this one is an

2001
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,880
rt5370 but this second one

2002
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,360
this is 2.4 gigahertz only i have one

2003
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,760
more that's working its way in

2004
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,520
it'll be here in a minute and again d

2005
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,960
message error 110 is a good thing

2006
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,920
wow

2007
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,960
it means it's on its way

2008
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,400
i'll give it a few more

2009
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,360
fast forward the video

2010
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,600
there you go there they are

2011
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,280
now all i'm going to do is i'm going i'm

2012
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,719
going to attack

2013
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:55,440
the wi-fi network called psk1 and i just

2014
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,040
want and this is just a quick demo i've

2015
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,400
got more coming later that are a bit

2016
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,760
more in-depth

2017
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,159
but this is just a quick one i'm saying

2018
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,480
use the dictionary file rocku.txt that's

2019
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,320
included with kali linux

2020
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,960
and i just simply go go and it says

2021
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,320
right which adapter do you want me to

2022
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,159
use it doesn't matter but i'll stick

2023
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:14,719
with number one

2024
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,360
it turns monitor mode on wireless lan 0

2025
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,360
starts scanning and says let me know

2026
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,719
when i found the network you want to

2027
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:21,920
attack

2028
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,520
so i want to tap that guy in the middle

2029
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,199
psk1 so i do control c once

2030
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:28,800
and it come up and says right who would

2031
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,840
you want to attack

2032
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,400
and i want to attack psk one that's on

2033
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:38,320
channel 11. using wpa uh uh kylix

2034
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,120
doesn't differentiate in wpa and wpa2

2035
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,199
it's the same attack right because we're

2036
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,199
attacking the

2037
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,360
we're attacking the four-way handshake

2038
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,480
which is the same on wpa and wpa2 oh

2039
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,600
that's it i've never seen that one

2040
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,520
before it's one of my neighbors using

2041
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,679
enterprise oh interesting make a note of

2042
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:56,400
that

2043
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,719
so i'm gonna just simply type in the

2044
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,760
number representing psk1

2045
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,360
which is number nine so i'm going to say

2046
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,440
please attack network number nine

2047
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,880
and off you go okay now

2048
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,040
it may go straight in

2049
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,440
uh or it may try and do a different

2050
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,360
attack i'm going to stop these these are

2051
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,199
not going to not going to work

2052
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,800
a pixie dust

2053
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,239
sorry a pixie

2054
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,480
dust pixie dust guitar

2055
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,600
and a um wps attack i'm not going to

2056
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,760
work today i've got aps are like 10

2057
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,679
years old they don't even work on them

2058
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:38,000
we fixed these attacks a long time ago

2059
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,520
so i'm going to just zip through these

2060
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,000
until i come to the attack that i want i

2061
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,080
don't care about that one

2062
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,600
you can't actually put a flag in to

2063
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,800
start to go straight to wpa right this

2064
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,719
one is probably not going to work as

2065
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,000
well

2066
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,840
and that leads us to

2067
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:59,920
the wpa handshake capture

2068
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,280
okay so it's listening it's not just

2069
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,600
there's two clients and it's going to do

2070
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,800
a de-authentication attack in four

2071
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,840
three

2072
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,719
two

2073
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,960
one

2074
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,880
so it's

2075
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,679
broadcast in a de-authentication attack

2076
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:21,080
it didn't work

2077
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:26,639
now i can speed this up now

2078
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:30,960
oh it just did it it just didn't

2079
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,159
so

2080
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:34,239
now it's going through

2081
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,760
trying to calculate what the key is did

2082
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,159
you notice that hd authenticated

2083
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:39,760
everybody

2084
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,600
disconnected me and off we go

2085
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,040
and so now we sit and wait when it gets

2086
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,199
to about 1.7

2087
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,320
usually

2088
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,520
it says the password is candy123 now

2089
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,120
just to let you know what it's doing

2090
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,280
it's going through every single word and

2091
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,719
by the way some of the words on the

2092
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:58,159
right hand side may be a little

2093
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:59,360
flavorful

2094
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,520
so uh if you see some cuss words i

2095
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,520
apologize

2096
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,800
still going

2097
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,040
oh did it there you go

2098
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,360
the password is i messed it up by moving

2099
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,480
the screen i'm sorry again

2100
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,920
the password is candy123

2101
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,280
now what it's doing is it's going

2102
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,639
through every single word

2103
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:27,679
okay and it it jumps several thousand

2104
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,600
words at a time so don't think it's

2105
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,120
showing you every single word it jumps

2106
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,400
for the words

2107
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,239
and it's going through and it says let's

2108
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,080
the word popcorn

2109
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,440
it then mixes it 4096 times with the

2110
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,800
ssid

2111
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,360
psk one

2112
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,280
and then takes a look at the four-way

2113
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,400
handshake

2114
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,760
and uses those values to calculate

2115
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,000
the ptk

2116
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,080
it then does the calculation on the mic

2117
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,840
exchange of number two

2118
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,000
if it fails it's the wrong password if

2119
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,560
it passes yeah i've got it

2120
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,280
so

2121
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,440
it's a very easy way

2122
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,560
to attack

2123
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,040
a wireless network now huge problem

2124
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:10,560
this attack only works

2125
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:15,600
this attack only works

2126
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,120
if

2127
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,639
the passphrase

2128
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:21,360
is in the dictionary file

2129
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,159
so

2130
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:23,600
for example

2131
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,280
if i did candy1234

2132
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,880
if that string is not in the dictionary

2133
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,760
file it will sit there for several hours

2134
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,639
and come back and say password not found

2135
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:37,360
the alternative is a brute force attack

2136
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,960
which is a different tool different

2137
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,440
utility okay but a brute force attack

2138
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,679
will go through every possible

2139
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,159
combination

2140
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,000
of letters

2141
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,560
letters and uppercase letters letters

2142
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,560
uppercase numbers letters uppercase

2143
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,840
numbers and special characters

2144
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,639
now

2145
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,719
the longer

2146
01:21:58,719 --> 01:21:59,679
the

2147
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:01,280
pass phrase

2148
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,880
the more secure

2149
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,719
and the more time it takes

2150
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,280
to try and guess it

2151
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,639
the longer the passphrase and the more

2152
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,520
complex the password

2153
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,679
the more difficult it is to guess the

2154
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:18,320
passphrase

2155
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,080
all right let me transition back over to

2156
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,840
my

2157
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,159
screen

2158
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,800
so as you can see that was a very very

2159
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,440
easy way

2160
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:36,719
to hack a wi-fi network now

2161
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:39,520
i knew what the

2162
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,679
ssid was and i

2163
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:45,199
had a pre-built dictionary file okay

2164
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:48,159
the problem is

2165
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:49,679
if the

2166
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,600
passphrase is not in the dictionary file

2167
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,840
it's not going to work so

2168
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,600
one thing you can do is

2169
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,760
if you're trying to use a password

2170
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,960
check if our password is in your

2171
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,880
dictionary file right

2172
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,480
don't upload it

2173
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,040
yeah send me your passphrase so let me

2174
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,480
check if we do a dictionary yeah don't

2175
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,400
do that right we all know that old scam

2176
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,040
uh so the little

2177
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,199
the little

2178
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,360
device i had it's a it's called the baby

2179
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,880
kraken it's a small it's a windows based

2180
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,000
platform

2181
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,880
of an actual tool called the kraken

2182
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,400
which

2183
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,000
last time i checked was using the

2184
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,560
high-end nvidia cards

2185
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,920
uh i knew i i built it as a proof of

2186
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,120
concept to have some fun with

2187
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,519
using

2188
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,280
uh

2189
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,080
1650s

2190
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,600
the kraken was operated on

2191
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,760
nvidia 30 90s

2192
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:52,719
okay

2193
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,480
now that one 130 90 has the same

2194
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,920
performance

2195
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,159
as my baby kraken bills just to give you

2196
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:01,760
a heads up

2197
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,440
130 90 has the same performance as the 8

2198
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,960
graphics cards on my baby kraken so can

2199
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,800
you imagine having 8 30 90s

2200
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,280
now that's probably i believe it's a 25

2201
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,040
000 machine

2202
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,960
but that is not

2203
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,800
outside of the realm of expenses of a

2204
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,400
professional

2205
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,800
attacker okay a professional threat

2206
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,679
actor

2207
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,560
whether it be country based criminal

2208
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,320
best

2209
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:35,600
25 000 for a kraken that will

2210
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,679
basically you've got eight times the

2211
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:39,679
functionality that what i had which

2212
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,080
means if i break it in eight weeks it'll

2213
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,679
break it in one week it's kind of that

2214
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,120
simple right

2215
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,760
and 3090s i believe are still the most

2216
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,120
powerful

2217
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,639
graphics cards out there but there are

2218
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,400
some others newer ones coming out now

2219
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,880
that provide even more quality the 30 90

2220
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,080
ti is coming up or 3080ti or something

2221
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,520
and it's all a function of raw

2222
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,239
processing power

2223
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,920
all right

2224
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,120
so

2225
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,880
the kraken

2226
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,679
as i mentioned

2227
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,679
what i just did there's a more

2228
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:15,840
a more complex or well it's not a more

2229
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,920
complex it's further down in the

2230
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,840
password dictionary file

2231
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,520
the dictionary file entry there was

2232
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,600
seven million in

2233
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,159
my baby kraken my baby cracking broke in

2234
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:30,400
0.27 seconds right that is one hell of a

2235
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,920
of a short amount of time to do

2236
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,560
dictionary attacks

2237
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,040
as i said it took like 100 times longer

2238
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,480
to initialize

2239
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:42,638
the run than the actual run itself took

2240
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,400
is there hope

2241
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,159
are we stuck

2242
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:48,159
well surely there must be a solution

2243
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:50,639
this is 2022 right we have self-driving

2244
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:53,360
cars my my buddy has as a tesla and he

2245
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,440
says that he can get on the 580 and he

2246
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,920
can sit back and just watch the road go

2247
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,440
by

2248
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,239
our our phones our iphones have more raw

2249
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,320
power than 1960 supercomputers we've

2250
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,719
talked about sending people to mars we

2251
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,600
have robots let's not mention cyberdyne

2252
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,080
systems

2253
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,320
the only solution to wpa2

2254
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,520
is

2255
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,960
use stronger

2256
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,880
longer passwords

2257
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,159
the end we're done that's it

2258
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:25,600
use longer

2259
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,719
stronger

2260
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:27,840
passwords

2261
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,639
now

2262
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,080
i forget the exact number because

2263
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,320
obviously this changes but i believe i

2264
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,000
believe the nsa

2265
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,120
i recommended 18 character passwords

2266
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,280
that will probably change next week

2267
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,000
yes i said 18 1 8

2268
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,040
not eight right

2269
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,360
and of course

2270
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,880
use

2271
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,199
use either words

2272
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,719
multiple words

2273
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:54,560
or mix in numbers and uppercase and

2274
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,000
lowercase as well

2275
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,159
the problem we have is the more complex

2276
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:00,560
you make the password

2277
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,719
the more likely the user is to write it

2278
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,400
on a yellow sticky and put it underneath

2279
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,400
the keyboard

2280
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,520
okay

2281
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,000
so the problem with long the problem

2282
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,840
with strong passwords is they're more

2283
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,719
complex yeah but users aren't going to

2284
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:15,760
remember

2285
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,400
trombone

2286
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,639
umbrella

2287
01:27:19,639 --> 01:27:23,520
7928 qxp 11.

2288
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,320
okay

2289
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,800
so longer passwords

2290
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,239
my birthday is in july

2291
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:33,760
and then use uppercase maybe

2292
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,120
of course i can't use that password ever

2293
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,920
again though can i

2294
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,760
so wpa3

2295
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,320
magical unicorns and stuff so

2296
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,800
create world peace and solve all our

2297
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,880
problems well maybe not but it's a lot

2298
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,560
better

2299
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:53,280
things you need to know about wpa3

2300
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,360
you need to understand

2301
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,520
not the algorithm but the concept of

2302
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,880
diffie-hellman

2303
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,440
elliptic curve diffie helmet sae and owe

2304
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,480
okay

2305
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,360
uh wi-fi 6e is coming wi-fi 6es are

2306
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,679
coming

2307
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,199
uh 6e is wi-fi and 6 gigahertz it

2308
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:17,440
mandates the use of wpa3

2309
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,480
so wpa3 is going to save us

2310
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:25,040
from the problems of wpa2

2311
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,120
so what's the problem with that well

2312
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,480
do you try and support it right

2313
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,000
your clients support

2314
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,560
wpa3 and if they don't

2315
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,480
you got a problem

2316
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:40,239
so i i turned wpa3 on my

2317
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:43,280
hero network at home and my son said hey

2318
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,120
my ipad won't connect anymore i'm like

2319
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:48,719
oh i'll have a look at it tonight

2320
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:50,480
and then my daughter said hey my ipad

2321
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,440
doesn't connect anymore

2322
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,520
if one user can't connect it's probably

2323
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,719
them

2324
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:00,960
multiple users can't connect probably

2325
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,080
you right

2326
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,840
and i went oh hold on i turned off the

2327
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,520
wpa3 does it work now yes it does ah all

2328
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,280
right do an update when's the last

2329
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,600
update on your ipads

2330
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,920
a year and a half ago right do an update

2331
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,719
now please they updated the ipads i

2332
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:19,120
turned on wpa3 and it turns out there

2333
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,040
was a software fix

2334
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,760
the latest version or the newer versions

2335
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,000
of the ipad software support the wpa3

2336
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,840
so wpa3

2337
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,320
solves the problems with wpa2 super

2338
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,519
duper mega awesome yay

2339
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,320
so what's the stiffy helmet thing so

2340
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,840
tiffy hellman is a method to create

2341
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,760
a secure

2342
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,000
unique key

2343
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,600
across a public transport

2344
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:50,800
okay

2345
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,480
by two enemies alice and bob want to

2346
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,400
talk to each other they pick a common

2347
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,800
color of paint they pick a secret color

2348
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,719
that they hold secret

2349
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:01,120
they mix the common and the secret and

2350
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,199
they send the mix across the public

2351
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:06,000
transportation system

2352
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,679
okay

2353
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:10,159
now you have to assume that the reverse

2354
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:12,239
engineering of the mixture

2355
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:15,280
is very very difficult very very

2356
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,679
difficult

2357
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,960
now but phil yellow and red makes orange

2358
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,040
yeah but the exact color the exact who

2359
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,560
the exact shade

2360
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,880
out of four billion colors is what are

2361
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,800
billions and billions of colors

2362
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,719
that's the point to understand when they

2363
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,239
mix

2364
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,239
the transmitted

2365
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:40,960
color with their secret color

2366
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,960
they end up with this yucky brownie

2367
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,040
green color that is common to both of

2368
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,120
them that anybody intercepting the

2369
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,120
communications cannot

2370
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,599
calculate

2371
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,719
that's what the diffie-hellman as

2372
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:56,639
explained on wikipedia

2373
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,480
with painters

2374
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,880
now uh i'm going to speed up because i

2375
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,480
do notice we are running up time very

2376
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,159
rapidly

2377
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:06,080
tiffy hallman is based on finite field

2378
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,000
discrete logarithmic methods x to the

2379
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,320
power of y mod p okay

2380
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,600
you don't need to

2381
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,679
know how to rebuild a car engine to

2382
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:15,040
drive a car

2383
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:18,320
just check the tires put gas in

2384
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,920
check the oil right you don't need to

2385
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,280
understand the mattress understand that

2386
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,679
this is a very very

2387
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:26,159
complicated mathematical method that is

2388
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:29,360
very difficult to reverse engineer

2389
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,679
well elliptive curved if your helmet all

2390
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:32,960
i'm going to say is

2391
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,560
it's very easy known knowing a

2392
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,639
an algorithm and a value to plot

2393
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:41,760
a graph

2394
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,480
you can then choose that point invert it

2395
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,480
jump a known tangent

2396
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:47,760
keep on doing this

2397
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:49,600
over and over again it's easy to do this

2398
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,719
from a known value to get to an end

2399
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:53,760
point

2400
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,639
given an end point on a graph

2401
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:00,960
it is very difficult to reverse engineer

2402
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,080
because you don't know how many times

2403
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,080
you jumped as well

2404
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,520
you actually do know the plot of the

2405
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,800
graph

2406
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,800
but you don't know how many times you

2407
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,480
did and what the tangent that you did to

2408
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,440
calculate the jump point too

2409
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,520
so just understand that a lifted curved

2410
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,360
if your helmet please understand is even

2411
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,520
more difficult to reverse engineer than

2412
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,159
diffie-hellman

2413
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,920
sae

2414
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,320
no so i googled sae this is what i came

2415
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,440
up with right

2416
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,760
no not oil

2417
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,639
simultaneous authentication of equals

2418
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:35,600
now the short version

2419
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,360
what do you know up to now you know that

2420
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:40,159
the pnk is calculated from the pre-shed

2421
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:40,960
key

2422
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,719
if we break the preset key if we guess

2423
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:45,280
the preset key we know the pnk

2424
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:48,320
everybody using the same preset key

2425
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,199
is using the same pmk

2426
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:53,520
right

2427
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,639
so what sae does it does a four-way

2428
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:58,960
exchange typically the authentication is

2429
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:02,159
two frames the association is two frames

2430
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:04,239
with sae it does a four-way

2431
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,800
authentication the result of which is a

2432
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,400
unique pmk

2433
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,840
for every user every time they connect

2434
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,080
the pre-shared key is still used to

2435
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,760
authenticate you

2436
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,360
but the pmk is calculated uniquely for

2437
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,800
every user every time they connect

2438
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,960
so that has completely stopped me being

2439
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,040
able to hack your wi-fi network

2440
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,120
because it doesn't matter if i connect

2441
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,280
to your network i can still do an attack

2442
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,760
trying to guess what your

2443
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,679
pre-shared key is and that will allow me

2444
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:38,239
to connect to your network but i can't

2445
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:41,440
decode anybody else's traffic anymore

2446
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,440
because they're all using their own

2447
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,960
pmk

2448
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,320
and even if i capture the four-way

2449
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,239
handshake there's no way i can reverse

2450
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,400
engineer the ptk

2451
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,199
so with wpa3 sae

2452
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:54,480
everybody

2453
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,199
has unique pmks every time they connect

2454
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,679
to the network

2455
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:01,120
okay

2456
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:04,159
i'm zip into this

2457
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:07,040
uh wp3 is also updated wpa2 which is

2458
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,960
allowing protected management frames

2459
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,880
which means when you say hey i'm your

2460
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,080
access point i want you to d

2461
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,040
authenticate you can say uh-uh

2462
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,440
we didn't use our secret key i know it's

2463
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,360
not you i'm ignoring you

2464
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,560
so the whole concept of the

2465
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,159
authentication attacks are now stopped

2466
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:25,920
it also enforces the minimum

2467
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,440
security and enhanced vendor security

2468
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:31,120
implementation validation as well

2469
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:34,960
wpa3 is the future it disallows tkip and

2470
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,159
it mandates the use of pmr

2471
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:41,440
so six gigahertz wi-fi by the way is

2472
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,600
mandated the operation

2473
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,040
of

2474
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,800
wpa3

2475
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,600
with pnf

2476
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,199
uh

2477
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:53,600
transition mode is available transition

2478
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,199
mode allows you to use wpa3 but if

2479
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,679
the client says i can't do wpa3 then you

2480
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,159
drop down to wpa2 guess what all the

2481
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:04,239
hackers have to do

2482
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:07,360
i don't use wpa3 now your network drops

2483
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:10,239
down to wpa2 level security and now i

2484
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,800
can do the four-way handshake capture

2485
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,880
attack and i can guess

2486
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,920
your network's data i can get guess your

2487
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,440
pre-shared key

2488
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,840
or your passphrase really which can lead

2489
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,840
to me calculating your appreciate key

2490
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,080
which means i can look at all you did

2491
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:26,960
okay

2492
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,000
so i have a personal opinion you don't

2493
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,800
use transition

2494
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,440
well it's not more complex no i have one

2495
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:39,440
ssid for wpa2 and one ssid for wpa3

2496
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,560
don't use the same preset key

2497
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,080
and keep them separate keep them

2498
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,679
firewalled

2499
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:49,199
but that's one more ssid well

2500
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,199
there are some clients that won't work

2501
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:52,960
with transition mode which means you

2502
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,560
have to have transition mode and you

2503
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,960
have to up wpat two more so what's the

2504
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,880
difference

2505
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,320
one more ssid is a small price to pay

2506
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:06,239
for wpa3 security

2507
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:08,639
so wpa3 is resistant to offer a

2508
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:10,560
dictionary tax i can't capture data

2509
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,800
taken away with me i can't do password

2510
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,199
guessing attempts

2511
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,360
every user is protected with a unique

2512
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,080
pairwise master key

2513
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,159
users do not even see the difference as

2514
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:25,840
i said i turned wpa3 on my e-roll my

2515
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,440
iphone or my ipad connected to the

2516
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,040
network without any problems because

2517
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,199
they were capable the only problem i had

2518
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:33,199
i couldn't support it needed to be

2519
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,678
upgraded

2520
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,480
so in wpa3 personnel appreciate key will

2521
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,960
just provide authentication

2522
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,800
sae will replace psk for encryption

2523
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,199
and sae will negotiate the pmk then run

2524
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,199
the four-way handshake with the pnk

2525
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:52,480
negotiation from sae not the pnk

2526
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,920
calculated from the pre-shared key

2527
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,880
it's resistant to dictionary attacks and

2528
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,560
brute force attacks because you no

2529
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,960
longer attack in the pnk

2530
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:07,719
calculated by the pre-shed key

2531
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:10,800
um

2532
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,040
so as of july 2020 wpa3 first is

2533
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,760
required for wi-fi sex wpa3 and

2534
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,719
enterprise and owe are optional i think

2535
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:22,960
that may change very soon

2536
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,320
now when you go to a coffee shop

2537
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,480
you do not have

2538
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,560
any authentication or encryption you

2539
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,920
don't run the forward handshake owe

2540
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,840
is a new process that was brought out

2541
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,280
and it's not a part of wpa3 it's a

2542
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,760
separate process separate certification

2543
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,600
of the wi-fi alliance

2544
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,280
what happens is

2545
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,440
you do a standard authentication then

2546
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,119
you do a special

2547
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:53,679
owe using our friend elliptic curb

2548
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:57,119
diffie helmet so sae and owe use

2549
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:59,600
elliptic curved helmet and that is used

2550
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,719
to calculate the pmk which is then used

2551
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:05,119
to feed into the four-way handshake to

2552
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:09,199
give you a pairwise transient key

2553
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:10,480
but i thought you said you didn't have

2554
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,719
any encryption or authentication turned

2555
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:15,199
on yeah right you've got nothing turned

2556
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:17,199
on it's an open network

2557
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:20,400
but it still makes you use encryption

2558
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,280
joy joy joy john so you're at

2559
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,639
the airport you're at a coffee shop

2560
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,360
you connect to the open network and you

2561
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,719
still get all your data encrypted right

2562
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:35,600
super duper lovely

2563
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,520
wpa3 enterprise just makes it a little

2564
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,080
bit stronger but a lot stronger but it

2565
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,719
doesn't allow you to turn off pmf

2566
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:48,480
but other than that wps wp383 enterprise

2567
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,800
is just a stronger version of wpa2 at

2568
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:51,920
the end

2569
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,440
clients won't even notice if they

2570
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,440
support it they will notice if they

2571
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,719
don't support it right they will not be

2572
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,960
allowed to connect

2573
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,880
i'm going to zip through this

2574
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,239
blah blah blah my hero i'm running wpa3

2575
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:08,400
at home yes i am why because i can

2576
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,520
okay

2577
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,520
there comes a time guys and gals when

2578
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,360
i'm afraid to tell you this where

2579
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:14,880
your boss will say to you yeah but we

2580
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,840
can't upgrade wpa3

2581
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,920
because of all the

2582
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,360
barcode scanners we have in the

2583
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,199
warehouse it comes a time when you're

2584
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:24,639
going to take your boss aside and say

2585
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,119
boss we have to buy some new aps and

2586
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:29,280
wireless routers we have to buy some new

2587
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,199
barcode scanners

2588
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:32,400
i had a customer that said to me they

2589
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,480
didn't want to upgrade from web

2590
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,400
i don't want to upgrade from webfill

2591
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:38,080
because our barcode scanners don't

2592
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,119
support it

2593
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:41,280
i sat down and showed them that i could

2594
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:44,239
i said do i change your web key

2595
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:46,719
create add an ssd create a web key

2596
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:48,000
where you like

2597
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,880
all right

2598
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,639
and i turned on my hacking device and i

2599
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,040
cracked the web key 20 minutes later

2600
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,119
guess what they did next gang

2601
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,679
they upgraded the barcode scanners in

2602
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:00,080
their warehouse right

2603
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,679
the weakest link is the strength of the

2604
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:03,920
chain

2605
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,679
there was a little bit of information

2606
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:10,239
came up that wp3 is dead the w the wi-fi

2607
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:13,520
alliance did wpa3 and they kind of hid

2608
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:14,400
it

2609
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,080
or they didn't broadcast what they were

2610
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:19,440
doing so nobody tested it uh the same

2611
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,880
guy that did crack came out and said

2612
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,440
wpa3 is broken um i'll give you the

2613
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,440
short version of this all the vendors

2614
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,199
went yeah yeah yeah we fixed them don't

2615
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:30,480
worry about it so wpa3 is not dead it is

2616
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,639
not broken it is alive and well thank

2617
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:34,320
you very much as long as you use a

2618
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,639
reputable vendor and of course

2619
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:38,560
latest version of client firmware and

2620
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,560
drivers so all the problems that came

2621
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,639
out with wpa3 were um

2622
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:45,920
fixed

2623
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:49,040
by the vendors almost immediately

2624
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:52,159
all right uh

2625
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,239
can you pause the recording please

2626
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:56,559
michael

2627
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:02,639
so a quick bit of information for

2628
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,000
everybody if you want to learn more

2629
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,119
about

2630
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:08,880
wi-fi 6 and wi-fi 60 i've started a blog

2631
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,960
it's still in development there's a good

2632
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,800
bit of information on there

2633
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,239
it talks about

2634
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,840
a lot about wi-fi 6e

2635
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,520
okay uh there's only a few blog posts on

2636
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,199
there now but it talks about how i

2637
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:23,040
started working with wi-fi six the wi-fi

2638
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,760
6e wi-fi 6e remember is six gigahertz

2639
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,080
wi-fi you've got to buy new aps new

2640
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,000
wireless routers and you've got to buy

2641
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,600
new clients

2642
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,840
also

2643
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:39,360
you can go to nc adverts website

2644
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,679
and

2645
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,310
you will get information

2646
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:44,480
[Music]

2647
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,159
if you go to student resources you've

2648
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:48,639
got study resources which is a ton of

2649
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:50,080
information about

2650
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,560
wi-fi stuff all free

2651
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,760
and if you go to blogs

2652
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,679
there's lots of blogs on there about

2653
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:58,719
stuff

2654
01:41:58,719 --> 01:41:59,520
um

2655
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,320
one of my favorite blogs is whenever you

2656
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:05,199
go to a coffee shop

2657
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:09,919
that didn't work

2658
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,239
there you go when you go to a coffee

2659
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:16,800
shop only use protocols with an s right

2660
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,280
don't use protocols that don't have an s

2661
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,639
obviously the best thing you want to do

2662
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:24,320
is you want to use vpn vpns look it's

2663
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,360
got an s

2664
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,960
just having a bit of fun go guys and

2665
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:29,600
girls so

2666
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,360
now of course is

2667
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:33,119
for those people who don't use protocols

2668
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:34,560
with an s in them

2669
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,199
okay

2670
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:39,840
wpa3 with owe was encrypt their traffic

2671
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:43,080
as well

2672
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,080
all right

2673
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,639
um i've got some

2674
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:48,719
top tips here i'm gonna actually whizz

2675
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:49,760
through these

2676
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,080
pdfs gonna be available i'm gonna

2677
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:56,320
mention i am very aware of the time

2678
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,320
but i i thought it was two o'clock like

2679
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,320
i told you i'd get carried away so very

2680
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:01,360
quickly

2681
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,880
if it needs to be open filter it

2682
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,679
firewall it add a hotspot now use wpa

2683
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,840
30w on it

2684
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,760
owe is perfect because if clients don't

2685
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,560
support owe they will remain unencrypted

2686
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,400
but for those clients who do they will

2687
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,719
be able to use encryption

2688
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:21,600
uh use wpa2 don't use wpa web if you can

2689
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,360
move the wpa3 as soon as possible do not

2690
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,360
use transition mode

2691
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,760
have a separate network for wpa2 have a

2692
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,040
separate network for wpa3 do not use the

2693
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,800
same password

2694
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,920
on wpa3 and wpa2 why because i'm going

2695
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,320
to attack let's just say my mr nasty

2696
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,880
hacker i'm going to see your wpa2 when

2697
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,960
i'm going to see your wpa3 i get a

2698
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,360
dictionary attack with wpa2 i'll brute

2699
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,440
force your wpa2 the first thing i'm

2700
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,040
going to try is try that password on

2701
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,280
wpa3 oh it's the same

2702
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:56,000
bonus okay so don't do that

2703
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
use a safe password

2704
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,239
greater than 15 characters

2705
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:02,559
okay

2706
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,800
uh i believe nist

2707
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:09,040
nsa are now doing 18 or longer maybe 20

2708
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,679
20 or 22 characters

2709
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,360
okay

2710
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,400
uh

2711
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:17,360
watch out for social engineering okay

2712
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,400
at my house there's phil's network

2713
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,560
with the cisco firewall and there's the

2714
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,679
family network with the bitdefender box

2715
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:27,840
it's easy enough i also use cisco

2716
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,840
umbrella i don't know what cisco brother

2717
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,840
is but it's a dns

2718
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,119
filter

2719
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:35,679
so if i download an email offer to make

2720
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:37,600
a millionaire from a prince from

2721
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,600
somewhere if i click on it i'm not

2722
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,679
paying attention when it redirects to

2723
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:42,960
the

2724
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:46,320
cnc server umbrella goes no i'm not i'm

2725
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,239
not letting you resolve that dns entry

2726
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:49,440
no

2727
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,920
so i personally use

2728
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,280
dns

2729
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:54,320
um

2730
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,480
security i use cisco umbrella because i

2731
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,320
do a lot of work with cisco i'm sure

2732
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,920
that lots there are lots of others out

2733
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,520
there there are

2734
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,159
other free or cheaper ones

2735
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,080
but um you know is your are your kids

2736
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,719
giving out your

2737
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:10,480
passphrase to their friends when they

2738
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,239
come and visit

2739
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:14,480
right

2740
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,280
yeah i have a guest network at all

2741
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,400
all my

2742
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,080
corporate data

2743
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:23,840
is on my network not the family network

2744
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,520
uh i'm being sarcastic right don't

2745
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,600
change uwpa too fast it makes us hard

2746
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,159
for us to break this is sarcasm i'm

2747
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,159
british if you need to

2748
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:35,040
just do a lesson google british sarcasm

2749
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,119
it's very very

2750
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:39,199
kind of akin to what you guys call

2751
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:41,520
roasts over here right british sense of

2752
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,880
humor

2753
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,520
we have a wicked sense of humor

2754
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:48,000
and sarcasm if we say something we don't

2755
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,600
mean

2756
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,719
uh change your passwords frequently dan

2757
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,480
if someone leaves the company right now

2758
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,000
there's another thing coming out now

2759
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,480
from a lot of vendors it's called

2760
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:02,080
mpsk multi-preset keys and what happens

2761
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:05,679
is every user has their own pre-shed key

2762
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:08,400
now this is great because if a student

2763
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,520
in a dorm

2764
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,239
was to use multiple devices you turn on

2765
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:14,320
multi-preset keys and allow multiple

2766
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:18,320
devices to connect uh networks like mist

2767
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,400
will allow any devices that are

2768
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,560
connected with the same pre-shed key to

2769
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,199
him to communicate so johnny in the dorm

2770
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:27,440
his xbox his printer and his laptop and

2771
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,199
his tablet connect with the same

2772
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:30,960
pre-shared key he's now got a mini

2773
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,520
little network that only he can use it

2774
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,080
also means that if a user leaves you

2775
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,080
just change they appreciate

2776
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,000
it also means that you can have one

2777
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,960
pre-shed key for the iot on-boarding

2778
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,440
team another technique here is only let

2779
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,560
the it have the pre-shed key

2780
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,800
so only it is the pre-shed key nobody

2781
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,880
else knows it okay

2782
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,840
now that of course becomes very complex

2783
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,920
if a user leaves the company doesn't

2784
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,960
matter no one knows the pre-shed key but

2785
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:02,480
it means every time you want to onboard

2786
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:04,080
a new device you've got to take it down

2787
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,400
to the it department only it is the

2788
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:08,400
pre-shared key and you use multiple

2789
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,719
per user appreciate keys and a great

2790
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:13,119
combination

2791
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:16,239
okay well you can for the iot only iot

2792
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:18,800
only it has the iot pre-shed key and

2793
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,280
they must onboard it or ot

2794
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:22,719
then the users are allowed to have their

2795
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:24,000
own pre-share key and they can give it

2796
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
whoever they want to their network that

2797
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,159
gets

2798
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:30,879
becomes weaker

2799
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,480
uh i have a unique password never reuse

2800
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,679
it especially on wpa2 with wp-83

2801
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:39,679
every now and again scan your network

2802
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:42,239
nmap things see who's on there install

2803
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:44,639
the whips are they expensive

2804
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:48,080
uh raspberry pi e4

2805
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:49,520
run kismet

2806
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:50,639
that will let you know if someone's

2807
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:52,400
attacking your network it's not an

2808
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:55,119
awesome wips but it's free right or

2809
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:57,440
cheap

2810
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:00,480
uh forget wps pins we don't care about

2811
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,320
them these were broken years ago and

2812
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:05,040
most vendors will fix this now

2813
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,119
wps is where you press a button or a

2814
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:10,400
software key on your client and on your

2815
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,480
ap it does a different helmet to keep to

2816
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,360
create

2817
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:15,920
a passphrase key

2818
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:18,000
but

2819
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,480
i would disable wps you can't do wps on

2820
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,880
most enterprise access points i would

2821
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,719
disable it

2822
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:26,800
or at least change it

2823
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,199
be careful some older

2824
01:48:29,199 --> 01:48:31,679
home wireless routers say they disable

2825
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:34,400
it but they haven't

2826
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:37,040

introduction to hacking on a hacking

2835
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,159
class that i teach

2836
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:57,679
and i ask people how many of you are

2837

01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:05,920
att starbucks united wi-fi i know some

2841
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,600
people but i i don't actually allow them

2842
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,400
to connect i allow them to authenticate

2843
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,000
but i don't let them associate i don't

2844
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,440
give them an ip address because that

2845
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:14,880
would be naughty

2846
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,560
i said

2847
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:17,920
guys

2848
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,679
we're gonna hold it in

2849
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:21,360
why would there be helping honors and

2850
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,800
marriott rewards

2851
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:25,280
are you on an airplane no then how have

2852
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:27,840
you got united wi-fi and i point out to

2853
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,080
them that because their client networks

2854
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:33,599
have connected to these networks before

2855
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:35,360
they will automatically connect to them

2856
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,199
and they're open right it's one of the

2857
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:38,800
biggest security

2858
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,320
issues out there

2859
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,239
on an iphone or an ipad you cannot

2860
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:45,040
delete an ssid if you are no longer in

2861
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,760
the presence of that ssid

2862
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,679
so every now and again you've got to go

2863
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:53,040
and clear out all the stored ssids on

2864
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:54,480
your devices

2865
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:58,880
oh phil that is so inconvenient

2866
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,040
inconvenience say it all with me

2867
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,119
inconvenience is a hacker's best friend

2868
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:04,800
the harder they make it for you the more

2869
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,599
likely you are you're not going to do it

2870
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:08,960
i don't mean the hackers

2871
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,800
the harder the vendors make it for you

2872
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,800
the more likely you're not going to do

2873
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,719
it which means the hackers can leverage

2874
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:16,639
it and by the way when i say hackers i

2875
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:18,960
mean crackers like

2876
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,480
the bad the

2877
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,400
the nasty hat hackers

2878
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,960
not the nice people who attend phil's

2879
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:27,679
wi-fi talk

2880
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:31,360
uh guys gals use a firewall

2881
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,639
update

2882
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:34,080
um

2883
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:37,119
quick quick story for you

2884
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:39,280
i get a

2885
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,679
dhcp pool from

2886
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:42,880
comcast

2887
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,560
i get an error message saying my coolers

2888
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,880
run up i'm like what

2889
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,080
my phone my wife's phone my laptop and i

2890
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:53,119
count and i got nine

2891
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:55,040
nine devices

2892
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:56,960
and i'm like what so i go and look at my

2893
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:00,560
dhcp pool my net gear

2894
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,599
switch

2895
01:51:01,599 --> 01:51:03,840
has an ip address

2896
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,639
i'm like it's an unmanaged

2897
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:09,280
netgear switch i bought it because it's

2898
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,679
unmanaged well they only ask for an ip

2899
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,199
address so they can do a firmware update

2900
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:15,280
whenever they need to right

2901
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:18,400
my unmanaged netgear switch

2902
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,960
asked for an ip address and i found all

2903
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:23,199
these other devices that were grabbing

2904
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:24,960
ip address

2905
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,400
so keep an eye on the number of ip

2906
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,880
addresses on your dhcp pool like if

2907
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,760
there's 126 devices or ip address is

2908
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,119
given out

2909
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:35,920
why is that there

2910
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:38,400
again change the default username and

2911
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,920
password

2912
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:40,800
uh

2913
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,080
most

2914
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,920
admin username and password are listed

2915
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,440
on the internet

2916
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,679
if you don't believe this just google

2917
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:50,000
default login for netgear default login

2918
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
for asus d log default login for d-link

2919
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,119
change it or don't no ignore my sarcasm

2920
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:59,199
change it now keep up the date on your

2921
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:00,639
firmware when's the last time you

2922
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:02,960
updated the firmware on your

2923
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:05,760
netgear access point one check see

2924
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,400
there's a new one available

2925
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,800
if something changes find out why

2926
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,159
things just don't change for the hell of

2927
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:14,320
it

2928
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:15,360
uh

2929
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,440
only always use protocols with an s

2930
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,599
whenever i'm away from the office i

2931
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:22,639
always use a vpn

2932
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:25,920
if in doubt use a vpn out

2933
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:28,159
if you download the default kali image

2934
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:30,080
it's a good idea to change your

2935
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,280
passwords

2936
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,360
change the default password and also

2937
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,679
change your ssh keys right

2938
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:38,080
because if i download the kali linux

2939
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,400
default image and i don't change

2940
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,560
my ssh keys if you download it they kind

2941
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,560
of the same ssh keys

2942
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,239
so technically you can access it into my

2943
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:48,480
kali linux easily with a little bit of

2944
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,320
knowledge

2945
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:53,199
uh test it have a policy

2946
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:55,520
you don't have one go to these places to

2947
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:57,119
get one

2948
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:58,800
can test it

2949
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:00,159
get educated

2950
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:02,800
anybody get this one ecto garment

2951
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,800
anybody a big fan

2952
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,400
from the fifth element

2953
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,880
it's literally there's a point where

2954
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:11,520
she's unconscious and he kisses her and

2955
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,040
she points a gun to his head and says

2956
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:15,360
ektogamat and on the way out he asked

2957
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:17,199
the priest what does hector gamut mean

2958
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,760
it's never without my permission so if

2959
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,760
you do pen testing you all know that you

2960
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:24,000
never do it that the target's permission

2961
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,679
in writing

2962
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:28,159
duplicated right of course but get

2963
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:30,880
educated on these things uh if anyone's

2964
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,080
interested we do a course on cwsp

2965
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:36,480
which is wireless security professional

2966
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:39,440
from cwnp that is a very in-depth

2967
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,040
security class

2968
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:42,880
four days

2969
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:43,760
all right

2970
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,080
so i've got some demos and stuff to do

2971
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:48,719
uh stop there if we have any q a

2972
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:51,440
and then um we can stop the recording uh

2973
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:52,719
actually

2974
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:55,440
if you want to do the recording

2975
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,360
marco i can carry on do some demos

2976
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,199
people can watch it but let's do some q

2977
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:00,880
a first please can you stop recording

2978
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:03,840
please okay sure

2979
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:08,880
so i'm answering the question that was

2980
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,320
asked i think i've answered the question

2981
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,199
is asked

2982
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:12,159
um

2983
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:13,520
a big problem with wi-fi that people

2984
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:15,199
don't understand is

2985
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:16,480
is

2986
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,159
you can only connect to wi-fi if you

2987
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:20,320
know what's needed to connect the wi-fi

2988
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:24,000
so everything that you need to do

2989
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,320
is advertised by the access point in the

2990
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,239
beacons

2991
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:31,040
so what security are you using

2992
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,760
wpa2 enterprise or personnel is

2993
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,239
advertised in information element number

2994
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:38,320
48 and your beacons

2995
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:40,080
so if i if i want to attack you all i've

2996
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:41,280
got to do is look at your beacon and

2997
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,320
know exactly what security you're using

2998
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:46,719
what if i what if i hide

2999
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:48,159
my ssid

3000
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:49,599
you don't you can't it's physically

3001
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:51,280
impossible to do that there's a button

3002
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:54,000
that i can click on my access point no

3003
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,960
it says a hide ssid all it does is stop

3004
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:58,719
putting the name of the ssid in the

3005
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:01,199
beacon there's a little

3006
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:03,679
a little utility that i demo in my wi-fi

3007
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:05,360
hacking bootcamps

3008
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,360
uh where i i

3009
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:10,880
i turn on aerodump ng and i just let

3010
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,719
leave it there an aerodump ng says it's

3011
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:14,320
a hidden ssid

3012
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,400
somebody comes along and says hello can

3013
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,800
i connect to secret network and the

3014
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,639
access point because yes yes you can

3015
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,719
connect the secret network welcome to

3016
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:25,119
secret network an aerodump goes oh that

3017
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:27,920
hidden ssid it was secret network

3018
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,920
because all that hidden networks do is

3019
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:33,360
hide the ssid name from the beacons it

3020
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:35,840
does not hide them from the probes and

3021
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,840
the associations

3022
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,520
which a lot of people don't understand

3023
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,520
and of course any hackers wondering why

3024
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,880
when they see you have a hidden network

3025
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:45,199
they're going to go hmm what's he got to

3026
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:46,639
hide there which makes them more

3027
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:49,040
interested so hidden networks are

3028
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,360
literally a waste of time it does not

3029
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:54,000
stop it'll stop script kiddies messing

3030
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,360
with you but they won't stop a

3031
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:57,360
professional hacker from from it'll

3032
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,159
actually

3033
01:55:58,159 --> 01:56:00,239
it'll actually intrigue them as to why

3034
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:01,920
you've hidden it

3035
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,800
uh so

3036
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:08,639
hide in the network

3037
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:12,400
and the fact that the the

3038
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:14,560
beacons advertise everything that you're

3039
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,159
doing

3040
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:17,360
kind of

3041
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,199
gives you an easy access into how you go

3042
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,119
about attacking

3043
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:22,480
the network

3044
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:23,599
could you stop the recording there

3045
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:26,840
please marco

3046
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:30,718
go for it

3047
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:41,840
oh i'm sharing my screen okay

3048
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:43,440
right

3049
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:44,480
there you go

3050
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,280
so

3051
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:46,560
this will answer a couple of questions

3052
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:49,840
at the same time first of all

3053
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,320
we have kismet

3054
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:53,679
right

3055
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:58,239
kismat is a it's a hacking tool but it

3056
01:56:58,239 --> 01:56:59,360
also

3057
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:00,639
has basic

3058
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:03,280
whips functionality built in so if you

3059
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:04,800
just wanted to know if something nasty

3060
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:07,040
is going on you can find out from kids

3061
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,880
now first things first

3062
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:11,280
phil quick question are you sharing your

3063
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:14,159
cali are you sharing your uh bro

3064
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:15,840
hold on i'm sharing the wrong screen

3065
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:19,719
that's why don't

3066
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:28,159
so i'm sharing my other screen

3067
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:32,119
let me rectify that

3068
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,840
one of the benefits about an apple

3069
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,760
is that you have all these virtual

3070
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,679
screens you can use

3071
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:51,840
one of the problems of having an apple

3072
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,440
is you get lost with all these damn

3073
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:56,000
screens you can use

3074
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,800
yeah welcome to my world yes

3075
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,080
i'm fumbling guys because i first of all

3076
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,440
i've lost

3077
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:07,360
i've lost where i can share my screen

3078
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,040
and but now that i've found that i've

3079
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,400
lost where my

3080
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:12,719
calculator has gone hold on a second

3081
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:13,679
there you

3082
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:16,679
go

3083
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:25,040
sorry for this guys but um

3084
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:30,560
my cali screen is vanished

3085
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:33,520
the hell oh it's behind my presentation

3086
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:35,520
screen that's why

3087
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,599
ah technology don't you just love it

3088
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:41,440
there you go right now you should see my

3089
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:45,040
screen let me do that again then

3090
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,520
so all i'm doing

3091
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:50,400
is i'm running kismet just you have to

3092
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,560
install it uh it's actually installed in

3093
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,639
the latest version pre-installed of the

3094
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:57,119
raspberry pi so i got a raspberry pi 4

3095
01:58:57,119 --> 01:59:00,639
and i've run kizma kismet is now running

3096
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:02,480
now a little bit uh

3097
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:05,679
blahdy blah i've got to

3098
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:06,710
uh

3099
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:08,239
[Music]

3100
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:09,199
connect

3101
01:59:09,199 --> 01:59:12,199
to

3102
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,960
all i've got to connect to i believe is

3103
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,920
should be is

3104
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:27,679
this 3501

3105
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:28,880
correctly

3106
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:31,840
might be 35.2

3107
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:37,080
no

3108
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:50,719
oh it is 2501 it's uh

3109
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:52,400
it's actually the one

3110
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:54,080
that it displayed there

3111
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:56,000
i thought it was different but i was

3112
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,679
wrong

3113
01:59:57,679 --> 01:59:58,400
all right

3114
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,159
so that's kai linux

3115
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:01,119
okay

3116
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:02,080
now

3117
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:05,920
all i've got to do now is

3118
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,760
i gotta

3119
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:13,159
tell my

3120
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,400
activate

3121
02:00:18,159 --> 02:00:21,719
the data sources

3122
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:36,560
that's interesting

3123
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:38,840
okay escape fixes

3124
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:42,639
everything got to tell it

3125
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:45,840
to use

3126
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,840
i'm going to tell it to use wireless lan

3127
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:48,960
2.

3128
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:52,159
if i enable the source

3129
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:56,560
it should now start

3130
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:02,599
there you go seeing data on and now

3131
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,560
now you can see i am seeing

3132
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,239
ssids

3133
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:17,280
and i am seeing clients

3134
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,480
now

3135
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:21,280
first things first

3136
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:25,119
yeah yeah yeah you don't care about that

3137
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:27,760
all right there you go

3138
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:30,080
so kismet is happily doing its thing in

3139
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:32,960
the background right

3140
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:36,320
next thing

3141
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:37,920
i can carry on doing stuff with my

3142
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:40,239
kylian x

3143
02:01:40,239 --> 02:01:41,920
and i'm going to do this slightly

3144
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:43,119
differently

3145
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:45,119
i could re-run

3146
02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:47,679
the white fight but i'm going to do this

3147
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:50,679
differently

3148
02:01:51,119 --> 02:01:53,100
i am going to

3149
02:01:53,100 --> 02:01:56,359
[Music]

3150
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:58,239
let me check to see what's going on on

3151
02:01:58,239 --> 02:01:58,960
my

3152
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,719
wireless interfaces

3153
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:01,599
so

3154
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:04,880
while phi 0 is already in

3155
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:07,119
a monitor mode that's good

3156
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:08,000
okay

3157
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,840
so i am now going to do this i am going

3158
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:13,280
to go do arrow dump

3159
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:14,800
ng

3160
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:18,239
so run airodump ng and i'm going to use

3161
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:21,678
wireless lan zero more

3162
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,560
nope show me anything i want to know

3163
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,320
what i'm going to do is

3164
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:29,440
i am going to attack

3165
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,760
one of my networks so i don't attack my

3166
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:33,840
neighbors because that's kind of illegal

3167
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:37,520
and i'm really really illegal right

3168
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:39,199
so i'm going to attack see look there's

3169
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:42,080
a hidden network by the way

3170
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:44,159
there's psk1 that now all i'm going to

3171
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:46,320
do is i'm going to control c this and

3172
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:50,719
i'm going to d authenticate psk1 right

3173
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:55,520
so i'm going to just copy this

3174
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:58,480
and i am now going to do

3175
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:00,400
command i

3176
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:02,910
got earlier

3177
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:06,139
[Music]

3178
02:03:09,119 --> 02:03:11,520
yeah air replay ng

3179
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:14,000
minus zero zero is a de-authentication

3180
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,040
attack

3181
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:19,760
i'm going to do this on wireless lan 0

3182
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:22,800
and i'm going to feed this in

3183
02:03:23,119 --> 02:03:24,800
now it probably will give an error the

3184
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,719
first time i run it

3185
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:29,040
because this is on channel 11 right so

3186
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:31,920
when i run it it'll probably not work

3187
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:33,119
yeah because

3188
02:03:33,119 --> 02:03:36,000
this particular card is on channel 13.

3189
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,679
so all i'm going to do now is i'm going

3190
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:40,080
to do that i'm going to tell it to be on

3191
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:42,880
channel 11. we should put it on channel

3192
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:45,040
m

3193
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:50,400
i think it's mad at me because

3194
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:54,840
it might be lowercase c

3195
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,239
there you go i've now put the card on

3196
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:06,560
channel 11 so now when i do the air

3197
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:07,679
replay

3198
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:09,280
minus 0

3199
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:11,440
is the authenticate

3200
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:13,360
0 is infinite

3201
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:17,440
use the bssid mac address of the ap that

3202
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:19,040
is the one i captured

3203
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,199
from psk1

3204
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:24,079
okay and what it's going to do now is

3205
02:04:24,079 --> 02:04:26,880
literally the authenticate

3206
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:29,520
the living hell out of that network as

3207
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:32,480
you can see it send in multiple frames

3208
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:34,239
i'm leaving this run i'm leaving it to

3209
02:04:34,239 --> 02:04:35,520
its thing because i have an ulterior

3210
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,360
purpose here

3211
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:39,119
so i am i'm not being separate there is

3212
02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:40,719
a more subtle version of that command

3213
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:43,280
that says the authenticate this client

3214
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,520
mac address on this

3215
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:48,719
ap but i'm letting this go rampant

3216
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:50,400
the reason i'm letting it go rampant

3217
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:52,800
because over here under kismet

3218
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:55,760
there isn't a new alert that has arrived

3219
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:57,760
i love it when the plan comes together

3220
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:00,239
and that new alert says um

3221
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:02,079
there's an awful lot of broadcasting

3222
02:05:02,079 --> 02:05:03,599
authentications going on in your

3223
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:05,360
neighborhood phil

3224
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:08,560
kismet has picked up someone trying to

3225
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:12,000
de-authenticate my client now it doesn't

3226
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,360
it says

3227
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:15,520
here's the mac address

3228
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:18,159
that is being used to broadcast so all

3229
02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:20,079
you got to do is take a look at it hey

3230
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:22,159
that hey that's the mac address of my ap

3231
02:05:22,159 --> 02:05:24,719
why is someone be authenticating me

3232
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:27,760
no good can come of someone broadcasting

3233
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:30,719
authenticating you

3234
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:32,159
and you can click here look and you can

3235
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:35,320
see them

3236
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:40,320
so it thinks it's doing this because the

3237
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:41,679
ap

3238
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:43,760
either the ap is shutting down when it's

3239
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:45,679
sending a de-authentication or there's a

3240
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:46,880
potential

3241
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,960
denial of service now

3242
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,800
you can run this

3243
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:54,079
on a raspberry pi 4 for like 60 bucks

3244
02:05:54,079 --> 02:05:57,440
with a free copy of kali linux installed

3245
02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:00,159
that's that's why i like kismet because

3246
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:01,840
kizma tells you what's going on in your

3247
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,360
neighborhood

3248
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:05,040
now there's a lot more to kismet than

3249
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:06,079
that but

3250
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:08,159
as you can see look it shows you

3251
02:06:08,159 --> 02:06:11,920
it shows you every time it sees one now

3252
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:17,000
if i was to do this

3253
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:18,079
and

3254
02:06:18,079 --> 02:06:21,280
like if i were to send

3255
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:25,760
if i were to just send out one burst

3256
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:28,079
okay

3257
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:31,199
it's quite possible that

3258
02:06:31,199 --> 02:06:34,079
kismet if it's looking at channel

3259
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:34,960
one

3260
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:39,040
is not going to see this on channel 11.

3261
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:41,840
okay and i can also do

3262
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:45,679
i can say the authenticate this

3263
02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:47,199
there's there's one more thing let me

3264
02:06:47,199 --> 02:06:49,280
show you one more thing

3265
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:52,560
if i look at this

3266
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,560
let me let me very quickly connect with

3267
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:57,719
my iphone

3268
02:07:01,199 --> 02:07:03,440
notice when it did that when i connected

3269
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:06,159
with my iphone

3270
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:08,800
right

3271
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,280
this aerodump said oh by the way i found

3272
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,840
this client

3273
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:16,480
trying to connect first of all

3274
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,719
first of all this client

3275
02:07:18,719 --> 02:07:21,840
is trying to get psk

3276
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:22,719
three

3277
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:28,239
whereas this client was looking for psk1

3278
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:31,040
now by the way it's continuously being

3279
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:33,440
disconnected because i know i've stopped

3280
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:34,880
the authentication

3281
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:37,760
so now i can do this

3282
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:40,560
and i can do minus a oh i've got another

3283
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:43,599
syntax i think it's

3284
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:48,520
it's minus c i think

3285
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:02,960
yes yeah they go so i can now redo that

3286
02:08:05,199 --> 02:08:07,360
i can do an infinite de-authentication

3287
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:10,719
but only of this client

3288
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,119
oh

3289
02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:14,000
sorry

3290
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,480
sorry sorry sorry hold on a second

3291
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:19,199
yeah that's right

3292
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:22,159
it's only the authenticate in the one

3293
02:08:22,159 --> 02:08:24,079
client now that should get kismet to

3294
02:08:24,079 --> 02:08:25,840
come up with a different

3295
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:28,320
warning

3296
02:08:30,159 --> 02:08:31,440
it's got to be on the channel when it

3297
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:33,760
sees them right

3298
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:35,280
it should get that eventually but of

3299
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,440
course it's a little bit more subtle now

3300
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:41,239
because i'm actually de-authenticating

3301
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,280
you see it picked up my idea

3302
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:49,599
authentication of all clients but it's a

3303
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:51,360
lot more difficult to pick up the

3304
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:54,960
authentication of one file

3305
02:08:57,679 --> 02:08:59,920
so i'm i'm doing a directed the

3306
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:02,639
authentication to this one client i'm

3307
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:07,119
sorry on this ssid to the one client

3308
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,639
i

3309
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:12,400
think i typed the syntax correctly bear

3310
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:15,559
with me

3311
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:39,440
uh

3312
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:43,079
minus a

3313
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:57,320
i'm pretty sure it's minus c

3314
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:09,560
i would have done it sometime

3315
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:35,079
ah no apologies that's the channel

3316
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:46,960
no it is one of c

3317
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:49,199
yeah that's it

3318
02:10:49,199 --> 02:10:52,239
it is minus c i'm good it's fine capital

3319
02:10:52,239 --> 02:10:54,560
c is the channel thank you

3320
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:56,400
as again you see i type these commands

3321
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:57,679
frequently

3322
02:10:57,679 --> 02:10:59,119
but not frequently enough to remember

3323
02:10:59,119 --> 02:11:01,440
they go

3324
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,119
and so we can

3325
02:11:05,119 --> 02:11:09,079
de-authenticate the client

3326
02:11:15,199 --> 02:11:16,800
there you go yeah that is the client mac

3327
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:19,199
address

3328
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,599
um oh i

3329
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:24,880
okay yeah

3330
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:26,880
but again

3331
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:29,119
usually picks this one up as well but

3332
02:11:29,119 --> 02:11:30,480
today it doesn't want to do it of course

3333
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:32,800
because we've been recorded

3334
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,400
it's it's

3335
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,800
it picked up the broadcast the

3336
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:40,239
authentications immediately

3337
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:42,960
and as you can imagine if i was just to

3338
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:45,280
go in and say

3339
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,560
you know just

3340
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,440
type in uh

3341
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:54,560
like to three bursts

3342
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:00,800
send three bursts

3343
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,280
that's gonna be less likely to be able

3344
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:08,400
to be picked up by your

3345
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:11,119
kismet or even a fully blown because

3346
02:12:11,119 --> 02:12:13,440
no wireless infusion

3347
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:15,599
protection system

3348
02:12:15,599 --> 02:12:18,639
uh captures all

3349
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:21,920
no capture all truck all channels

3350
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,840
so they're all looking out you know if

3351
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:25,040
you're not looking at the window when

3352
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:26,239
the vehicle goes past you miss the

3353
02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:29,559
vehicle right

3354
02:12:35,119 --> 02:12:37,519
there you go

3355
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:44,079
now you can see that now that he was

3356
02:12:44,079 --> 02:12:45,360
connected

3357
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:46,960
you can see that in this column i'm

3358
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:49,840
getting some hits

3359
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:03,159
all right

3360
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:17,119
so that was a demo of kismet that was a

3361
02:13:17,119 --> 02:13:20,239
demo of um white fight i did a demo of

3362
02:13:20,239 --> 02:13:22,239
error damp

3363
02:13:22,239 --> 02:13:26,239
added up ng helps you find networks

3364
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:28,560
and i don't ng actually do hidden

3365
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:31,280
networks kismut will help you find

3366
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:34,159
networks and ssids and clients and also

3367
02:13:34,159 --> 02:13:36,480
show you of any broadcast attacks going

3368
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:38,638
on

3369
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:40,330
um

3370
02:13:40,330 --> 02:13:41,760
[Music]

3371
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,960
i showed you a dial attack

3372
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:48,719
jammin be very careful with german

3373
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:50,960
airplay ng i can be authenticated that's

3374
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:53,520
a form of jamming we also have hardware

3375
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:54,880
jammers

3376
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:56,560
give it to our marketing team and they

3377
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:58,400
decided to add some jam

3378
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:00,800
you get it jams yeah

3379
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:03,199
uh hardware dramas there may be legal

3380
02:14:03,199 --> 02:14:06,960
issues if you jam your neighbors network

3381
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:09,920
they can sue you for it okay it's

3382
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,880
illegal to jump a legitimate network now

3383
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:14,239
obviously they've got to catch you first

3384
02:14:14,239 --> 02:14:16,800
but it's happened to mariot networks

3385
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:19,360
over in

3386
02:14:19,360 --> 02:14:21,840
oh i forget which state it was

3387
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,760
but um

3388
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:27,119
they were jamming people's mind fights

3389
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:29,040
and they went to court the judge says

3390
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,960
fifty thousand dollar fine

3391
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,719
they appealed

3392
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:34,079
and the judge said well let me just

3393
02:14:34,079 --> 02:14:36,159
clarify now

3394
02:14:36,159 --> 02:14:38,960
you block them using their my fight yes

3395
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:42,000
and you did it for security reasons yes

3396
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:42,880
but

3397
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:45,040
if they didn't use their wi-fi they had

3398
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,440
to pay to use your wi-fi

3399
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:48,320
yes

3400
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:50,159
yeah i think you're taking advantage and

3401
02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:51,760
up to five to five hundred and fifty

3402
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:53,840
thousand

3403
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:55,760
judge said look you said you were doing

3404
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:57,360
obscurity reasons but you were blocking

3405
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:59,520
them using their own wi-fi

3406
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,040
and then telling them they have to pay

3407
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:03,440
to use yours i'm not allowing it

3408
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:06,159
500 and something thousand dollar fine

3409
02:15:06,159 --> 02:15:09,679
and google it it's a true story

3410
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:11,440
what they were doing they were blocking

3411
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:13,840
people using like verizon and atm t my

3412
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,920
fi networks they said they would do it

3413
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:17,440
for security reasons

3414
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:19,440
the second judge disagreed with them and

3415
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:23,239
charged them half a million

3416
02:15:25,199 --> 02:15:28,159
uh i think that's us done gun or you can

3417
02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:30,239
also create your own word lists

3418
02:15:30,239 --> 02:15:33,440
so here's an example proof of concept uh

3419
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:34,719
from michael

3420
02:15:34,719 --> 02:15:37,199
where he's got a a python script where

3421
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:39,360
you type in what's the person's name

3422
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:40,880
what they did at birth

3423
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:42,960
do you know the dogs and the pet's name

3424
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:43,920
um

3425
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:45,599
you type in loads of information about

3426
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:47,599
them and then he does a use a python

3427
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:48,800
script to

3428
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:50,480
randomly create

3429
02:15:50,480 --> 02:15:52,560
common

3430
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:55,119
last name

3431
02:15:55,199 --> 02:15:57,520
month year of birth and all sorts but

3432
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:00,400
it's really not usable but it's it says

3433
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:02,719
it's a proof of concept to show you if

3434
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:05,440
you gather enough intel on someone you

3435
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:07,360
can probably create your own

3436
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:10,079
dictionary of potential words

3437
02:16:10,079 --> 02:16:12,800
as you guys and girls all know how

3438
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,400
surprising it is

3439
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:16,480
that facebook hack down in los angeles

3440
02:16:16,480 --> 02:16:17,440
right where

3441
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:20,560
um a haka cracker went through

3442
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:23,119
people's garbage said

3443
02:16:23,119 --> 02:16:25,840
hacked into hundreds of hollywood stars

3444
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:27,040
and starlets

3445
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:28,639
and he said you'll be amazed how many

3446
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:31,360
people their password is their maiden

3447
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:33,760
name or their mother's maiden name and

3448
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:37,760
their dog's name but they did a bird

3449
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:41,040
and uh

3450
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:43,040
yeah this this is a bit more of an

3451
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:44,799
individual attack this is what white

3452
02:16:44,799 --> 02:16:46,959
wi-fi is doing for you okay it's

3453
02:16:46,959 --> 02:16:49,599
capturing the four-way handshake

3454
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:51,920
and it's the authenticating the clients

3455
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:54,240
in the forward handshake

3456
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:55,679
and

3457
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:57,679
then it's once it's got a four-way

3458
02:16:57,679 --> 02:17:00,318
handshake it's running the aircraft tool

3459
02:17:00,318 --> 02:17:02,318
or its own tool

3460
02:17:02,318 --> 02:17:04,318
using a known word list to look for

3461
02:17:04,318 --> 02:17:07,599
matches of the

3462
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:10,478
passphrase

3463
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:14,558
very quickly cow part is another two

3464
02:17:14,558 --> 02:17:15,519
uh

3465
02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:16,638
here's me

3466
02:17:16,638 --> 02:17:19,280
sat outside your office

3467
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:22,399
running um

3468
02:17:23,359 --> 02:17:25,120
cow party

3469
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:29,559
okay and cowpatty choke

3470
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:34,478
3000 seconds to go through the

3471
02:17:34,478 --> 02:17:37,358
passphrase list

3472
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:40,718
okay 163 passphrases a second

3473
02:17:40,718 --> 02:17:43,359
it's got to create the pmk

3474
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:46,398
test it move on here's me

3475
02:17:46,398 --> 02:17:48,240
taking a

3476
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:49,920
dictionary file

3477
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:51,599
passing it through and here's the

3478
02:17:51,599 --> 02:17:53,359
command i used at the bottom to show you

3479
02:17:53,359 --> 02:17:54,879
what the command was

3480
02:17:54,879 --> 02:17:58,558
here's me using the gen pmk tool of

3481
02:17:58,558 --> 02:17:59,920
kaupati

3482
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:03,160
to pre-compute in in my lounge i

3483
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:05,920
pre-computed it

3484
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:07,760
every possible combination of what the

3485
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:11,599
pmk could be for every word

3486
02:18:11,599 --> 02:18:14,718
and it did it in 50 000 seconds i went

3487
02:18:14,718 --> 02:18:16,959
you know at my dinner while it did this

3488
02:18:16,959 --> 02:18:18,959
the next day when i'm stood outside your

3489
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:21,760
premises i know i'm attacking your ssid

3490
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:23,760
i'm attacking it based on the dictionary

3491
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:24,558
file

3492
02:18:24,558 --> 02:18:26,398
it took me five seconds to go through

3493
02:18:26,398 --> 02:18:28,638
all

3494
02:18:30,638 --> 02:18:32,318
actually this is only got 500 plus

3495
02:18:32,318 --> 02:18:33,280
phrases

3496
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:36,398
this is a smaller version

3497
02:18:36,398 --> 02:18:38,718
i'm sorry it went through nine million

3498
02:18:38,718 --> 02:18:40,638
passphrases and

3499
02:18:40,638 --> 02:18:42,318
i added sister one to three at that

3500
02:18:42,318 --> 02:18:43,519
point

3501
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:45,519
here it went to all possible

3502
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:47,679
combinations in five seconds because i

3503
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:50,398
pre-computed the pnk's now the problem

3504
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:51,679
with that is

3505
02:18:51,679 --> 02:18:53,519
if the passphrase is not in the

3506
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:57,679
dictionary it still doesn't work right

3507
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,718
and i think i am going to

3508
02:19:00,718 --> 02:19:03,358
stop there

3509
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:05,120
uh

3510
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:06,959
make sure your wi-fi networks are secure

3511
02:19:06,959 --> 02:19:09,599
wpa2's time is winning wpa3 is the

3512
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:10,959
future

3513
02:19:10,959 --> 02:19:13,920
future looks bright 50 will bring change

3514
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:16,799
be a little paranoid right work together

3515
02:19:16,799 --> 02:19:19,200
with your users your vendors your client

3516
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:20,799
suppliers

3517
02:19:20,799 --> 02:19:23,040
wpa3 is the best thing you can do at the

3518
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:24,638
moment

3519
02:19:24,638 --> 02:19:27,599
move to wpa3 with your devices and your

3520
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:29,920
clients while you transition over have

3521
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,359
two separate ssids one for wpa2 one for

3522
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:34,879
wpa3

3523
02:19:34,879 --> 02:19:36,959
do not use transition mode do not use

3524
02:19:36,959 --> 02:19:40,638
the same password on each

3525
02:19:40,638 --> 02:19:42,478
there's me

3526
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:43,760
and

3527
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:44,879
again

3528
02:19:44,879 --> 02:19:46,558
uh can you stop the recording there

3529
02:19:46,558 --> 02:19:49,840
