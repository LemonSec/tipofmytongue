24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,799
some people so this is our meetup page

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,799
so this is where we post events every

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,680
month

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,920
and that's how you keep track of what

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,760
we're currently doing as far as the

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,439
community-wise right

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,799
um

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,119

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,799
a lot of new people in fact half of the

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,560

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400

42

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,159
actually uh can you turn to the uh

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,479
standy please we have two new standings

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,119
as you we're coming in through the doors

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,960
we have a standing there that talks

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,680
about our non-profit and also he talks

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,679
you know the other stand here talks

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,760
about the uh the meetup

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
so long story short and since

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,160
everybody's new here how we started we

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,239
started the pacific hackers meetup about

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,840
five six years ago

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
and it was just

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
meeting like this every month talking

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,680
about um

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,000
you know secure related stuff uh playing

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,840
ctfs and so on

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,560
uh but we were starting helping people

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,680
to get into jobs and you know and so on

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,400
so

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,519
we got to the point where a person say

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,599
well why you don't do it at the bigger

68
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,280
level and i say oh why not and uh how do

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,879
we do that

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,480
and the best way to do it obviously was

71
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,360
as a nonprofit so pacifihackers.org

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
became a non-profit um

73
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
exactly in august first of last year and

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
that's when we started actually doing

75
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,200
you know you know helping more people

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
and and stuff like that and that's

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,519
basically who what we what we do now so

78
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,760
now besides having the meetup besides

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
having the conference which i'm going to

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,080
talk about

81
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,239
uh you know we have an organization

82
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,480
who's helping the mission of this

83
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,879
organization is number one diversify the

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,480
cyber security industry

85
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,120
number two we want to um

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,000
uh

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
fix the uh the school system so the

88
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,879
school system as you probably know or

89
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,840
seen

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,360
uh they're not teaching the correct

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
stuff so when they graduate

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
they don't they're not really ready to

93
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,280
go to the workforce so we want to show

94
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
them what they really need to know in

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,040
order to get a job number three is um

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
fixing the hr system

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,920
uh it's very insane when they you know

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,159
you see the job post saying i want a

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,840
junior analyst with cissp well in order

100
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
to get a cissp you need five years of

101
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,680
experience in the field so that's insane

102
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,879
so what we're trying to look here is

103
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,959
make direct connections so far we

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,480
already placed people

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,239
from different backgrounds into the

106
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,840
workforce one at nasa one into um intel

107
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,000
another one into a

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
consulting company as a penetration

109
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,799
tester

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,400
and again i actually was one of uh

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,238
how i got my job you know a few years

112
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,320
ago is i was giving a presentation on

113
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,759
this same place

114
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,560
and and my uh my manager was there

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
and my presentation was

116
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,080
my my

117
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
pretty much

118
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
my ticket to

119
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
you know to the job that was my

120
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,280
interview so that was on a sunday and by

121
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,000
friday i was hired so that tells you

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
that meetups like this are very

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
important because your potential manager

124
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,160
your potential co-worker are already

125
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,840
here and i just have to make that

126
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,240
connection so we need attendance a lot

127
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
of people choose to go um uh hybrid

128
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,919
because obviously covet and i we really

129
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,880
understand that but we also see that and

130
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,199
especially at defcon that

131
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,960
we need um you know the in-person uh you

132
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
know touch because that's just that's

133
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,639
not going away okay

134
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,080
so um

135
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,160
so number one so i'm i'm just showing

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,080

200
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,360
um

201
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
if you can make it and you miss the zoom

202
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,280
well we have the pacific hackers uh

203
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,479
youtube page this is where all our you

204
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,319
know videos are and you've probably seen

205
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,160
some familiar faces like this guy right

206
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,800
here and this guy right here and and

207
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,039
probably some other people oh here you

208
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,400
go that's another

209
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
start right here uh well so

210
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,919
before uh the pandemic we were not

211
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,639
recording our videos uh because for us

212
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,240
it was very important to have that in

213
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,440
person

214
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
obviously coffee came up and we didn't

215
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,919
we never stop we continue

216
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,000
and to make it accessible to everyone

217
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,960
and and that's when we actually start uh

218
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
creating some sessions

219
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
and uh you know inviting and getting

220
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,120
more people so that was a good thing the

221
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
community never ended copy did not stop

222
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,199
us and that was a great thing

223
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,120
um that's just telling us that people

224
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,560
are willing to learn and willing to

225
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,520
share knowledge and everything else um

226
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,120
so that's great right so um what we're

227
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
trying to accomplish here and and this

228
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
is where i'm moving with the defcon

229
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,280
thing is

230
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,919
few things so a couple of weeks ago we

231
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,440
um

232
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,320
we had a ctf pre-defcon ctf

233
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,599
and the winner of the ctf uh won a a

234
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,080
batch to defcon so these are also the

235
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,159
type of things that we do and in fact i

236
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,360
have the uh

237
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
the picture right here so alex

238
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,240
congratulations

239
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,959
so

240
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,160
we uh we uh um you know alex won the

241
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,399
first place on our ctf and and he won a

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,600
team

243
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,839
well you know but you did it

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,279
uh the point here is that we want peop

245
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,160
more people like alex to come and

246
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,519
and well first of all share the

247
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,600
knowledge and and also prove yourself

248
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,240
and why not win something

249
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
because

250
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,720
this was just our ctf but then

251
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,360
um if i just go back here to

252
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
other things

253
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
we want

254
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,399
first place

255
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,200
at the railroad ctf at defcon

256
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,760
and and this one was huge because

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,480
two teams from pacific hackers and hack

258
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,680
miami got together

259
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,800
we have a member here in fact oh you

260
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,040
were not on this picture because

261
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,760
well

262
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,000
but i took the picture on his behalf

263
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,880
okay so i i helped him out a little bit

264
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,040
you know uh but they did all the job

265
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,000
here are some of the pictures um this

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,720
again this this team was formed

267
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
out of

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
you know people who randomly met with

269
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,160
just like the people in miami obviously

270
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
have never been here and have you been

271
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,600
miami probably not so they met at def

272
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,399
con right and then from there they say

273
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,200
well let's form a team let's play a ctf

274
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200

things work

463
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,600
all right so

464
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
uh where did this talk come from uh so

465
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,440
some people got

466
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,799
uh

467
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,720
um i don't know if

468
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
uh you know everyone is familiar with

469
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,960
what this is but it was a small little

470
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,679
project to build the sort of tamagotchi

471
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,600
rf hacking device

472
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,200
and people got the flipper zero and

473
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,960
they're like this is cool

474
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,039
what can i do with it i don't know

475
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,039
um and so

476
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,240
i i

477
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
previously was working at nasa and now i

478
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,320
am working at amazon doing device work

479
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,559
and one of my big

480
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,520
fields of study is rf technology which

481
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,600
is exactly what the flipper zero is is

482
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,480
doing

483
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,000
uh so what i'm hoping to do is give

484
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
people an understanding

485
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,360
of you know the capabilities of the

486
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,440
flipper and what the different

487
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,919
you know functions it provides you know

488
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,080
are doing at a very fundamental level as

489
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,240
well as give some

490
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,480
practical examples uh so this talk is

491
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,080
going to be

492
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,160
a largely sort of like a science lecture

493
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,720
i would rather do like a ctf but because

494
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
i would have to give everyone all this

495
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,320
equipment so that's not going to happen

496
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,440
so

497
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
um

498
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,880
let's see once again my name is caitlin

499
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,400
hamilton and i'm glad to be here and

500
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,080
we're going to start off by looking at

501
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
the infrared sensor which is

502
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
you can see it on the camera which is

503
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
this big black

504
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,960
square thing here and you may have seen

505
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,640
this on like remote controls and stuff

506
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,320
before and we're going to do a bit of a

507
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,919
deep dive into what's going on here this

508
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,240
is actually kind of interesting

509
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,960
but infrared light is light you can that

510
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,360
just before visible spectrum so if you

511
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
look at the spectrum

512
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,440
um of like the rainbow you'll see at the

513
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,039
lower end lower wavelength and visible

514
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,400
light you have red

515
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,240
and that goes all the way up to our

516
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,520
friend roy g bib roy gb um

517
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
but but below the visible spectrum

518
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
there's something called infrared or

519
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,880
like below red

520
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,160
um and

521
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,320
that's where these transmitters come in

522
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,240
they're basically shooting light in that

523
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,919
spectrum

524
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,960
and if we look at a simple

525
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,559
infrared transmitter that you would hook

526
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,160
up to like an arduino or something it's

527
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,559
very simple ridiculously simple three

528
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,120
panels one's power one's ground one's

529
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,840
data it blinks an led on and off that's

530
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,280
all it does

531
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
um and then if you look at the receiver

532
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
it almost looks deceptively just as

533
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,640
simple but we're going to find out in a

534
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,120
second it's not actually so you have the

535
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,520
same three pins so what you send to one

536
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,600
device you sort of read back on the

537
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
other uh but you have this like black

538
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,760
sort of

539
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,280
uh i'm gonna say transistor looking

540
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,640
thing here uh called the ir receiver

541
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,200
um and if we go and look around for this

542
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,520
part we see that it is an ir receiver

543
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,080
diode that's three legs looks a lot like

544
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,159
a transistor now most diodes have two

545
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,200
legs this has three what's going on um i

546
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,240
went to the data sheet and it was

547
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,760
actually kind of interesting

548
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
um so i initially thought this would

549
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,000
just be like a a light sensor like a

550
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
photodiode but it's not and

551
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,919
unfortunately

552
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,840
zoom is kind of covering things up here

553
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,640
but

554
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
um if you look at the diagram here you

555
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,919
can see that there's actual signal

556
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,600
processing going on

557
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
uh so what happens is that you get the

558
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,440
infrared light going in actually has a

559
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,960
control circuit which i'm pretty sure is

560
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,600
doing a face lock loop of some kind uh

561
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
the atc is automatic gain control which

562
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,000
is oftentimes employed right before it's

563
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,919
uh a radio does some sort of am

564
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,240
amplitude modulation

565
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,320
um and then yeah it demodulates the am

566
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,080
signal um and then sends it back through

567
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
a transistor essentially which

568
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,520
you know blinks the data signal so it's

569
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,360
not just it sees lights therefore it

570
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
turns on there's actually data

571
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
processing going on in

572
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,840
these modules

573
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,360
and i have some of these modules set up

574
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,559
to go

575
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,440
so

576
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
um

577
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,880
right so yeah so

578
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,440
uh this module the rr frequency

579
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
is running at about 38 kilohertz that's

580
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,840
usually what we see in these ir remotes

581
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,880
about 38 kilohertz uh although you can

582
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,840
find ir transceivers and receivers

583
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
running on a few other different

584
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
frequencies like 30

585
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,760
uh you know 40 56 but never that high

586
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,400
which is weird right because

587
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,240
usually we think higher wavelengths

588
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,880
using really fast data speeds uh like

589
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
for example five gigahertz wi-fi wi-fi

590
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,000
is faster than 2.4 for various reasons

591
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,760
uh but with ir it's a sense of old

592
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
technology and it's basically like morse

593
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,799
code

594
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,120
that all the stuff's really slow um and

595
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,360
it's just like off and on like like like

596
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,200
it's literally like almost the exact

597
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,880
same thing like fast morse code

598
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,960
up

599
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
um

600
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,589
[Music]

601
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,960
oh

602
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,440
um

603
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,840
[Music]

604
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,159
oh okay

605
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,000
yeah let's let's change that to

606
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,919
this one right

607
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,120
that's it

608
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,559
hopefully people can hear me better now

609
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,760
okay can you

610
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,600
yeah don't worry yes we are i assure you

611
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,320
we are technology professionals uh

612
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,679
we know what we're doing

613
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,480
yes

614
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,120
so it's a good trick to check if we want

615
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,480
to be remote

616
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,320
responsible yes yes so you can use this

617
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,200
on any tv remote any ir remote uh you

618
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,880
turn your your front-facing camera or

619
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,640
any cheap camera like i said well this

620
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,720
will not work on a good camera but on a

621
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,240
cheap camera where they don't filter the

622
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
ir and when it comes into the

623
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,080
sensor you can actually see the lights

624
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,679
turning on and off

625
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,760
and it comes in like kind of magenta

626
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,840
which you notice

627
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,600
so anyway so i

628
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,200
uh wait

629
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,880
why did you pick the front camera

630
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,360
because he tried the backhand ones too

631
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,440
oh well that's that's probably because

632
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,679
the back camera it shouldn't work so you

633
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,919
usually when you have a a back camera

634
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,480
there's you know lenses and coatings and

635
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,880
it's supposed to block infrared light

636
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,120
so what do you mean why is that

637
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,600
uh you get a better image

638
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,000
the sensors can't distinguish between uh

639
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,760
you know infrared and

640
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,279
you know other types of

641
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,200
uh lights that we can see but of course

642
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,720
we as humans do

643
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,480
so we as humans normally would not see

644
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,080
anything in infrared

645
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,840
uh so a good camera is going to filter

646
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,000
that out a really good lens fill

647
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,279
but if you don't have those lenses

648
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,520
you're using a cheap you know camera and

649
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,120
usually front facing cameras are better

650
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,039
for this because they're cheaper you'll

651
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,559
you'll be able to see the light from the

652
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,600
infrared

653
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,799
uh remote

654
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,480
okay so cool so we saw that that was

655
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
awesome uh am i still sharing my screen

656
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
i am

657
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,279
uh so yeah so

658
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,240
when you send data from the ir like your

659
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,559
ir remote you're only seeing a few bytes

660
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,000
literally like sometimes it's just four

661
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,039
bytes

662
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,440
and that's it um and you need of course

663
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
line of sight ir is just like regular

664
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,039
light it'll bounce off walls it won't go

665
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,559
through anything

666
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,640
and of course uh

667
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,320
remotes have been around forever so you

668
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,360
expect there to be like a

669
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,200
standardization and everything no of

670
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,039
course not every company has their own

671
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,640
standards that they use and employ and

672
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
if you've ever bought a universal remote

673
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,559
control you know how frustrating this is

674
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,400
we could have universal like ir

675
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,480
standards but we don't so you have like

676
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,840
nec you have sony you have panasonic all

677
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,600
doing their own thing why i don't

678
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
but the most common you'll find in most

679
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
electronics is nec uh that's the the

680
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,520
pawn electric company they made the

681
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,679
turbo graphic 16.

682
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,559
um

683
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,360
and

684
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,120
there and essentially all it does is it

685
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
sends out two bytes of an address and

686
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,039
then one byte for a command so if you've

687
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,360
ever used like the commodores before

688
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,880
and you and you just like poke an

689
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,320
address that's essentially all it's

690
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,159
doing it says here's an address here's a

691
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,840
value boom that's the command

692
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,440
okay so i made my own little ir remote

693
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,039
we can take a look at here

694
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,960
and we're going to use the flipper to

695
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,039
decode it

696
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,159
so i need another volunteer

697
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,600
to come up oh

698
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,480
camera here so

699
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,520
perfect

700
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,679
so okay so we have a receiver here and

701
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,760
this is just a

702
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,039
essentially a light bulb that's going to

703
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,240
turn on

704
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,880
and oh my goodness

705
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,320
by the way i love these velcro ties they

706
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,520
are amazing

707
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,760
uh don't let my current situation deter

708
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
you from getting velcro ties for all

709
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,640
your cables

710
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,159
i just need to detangle these

711
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,000
there we go okay

712
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,559
uh so like i said this is a uh receiver

713
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,559
and there's the little uh ir receiver

714
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,080
that we saw earlier

715
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,919
connected to it and when it receives the

716
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,000
right command it will turn on the light

717
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
bulb

718
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,000
there we go

719
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,799
and now we have on this breadboard

720
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,120
a remote control with a single button

721
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,640
if i push the button the light will come

722
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
on hopefully if i

723
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
did not completely work this up on the

724
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,159
way here

725
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,640
oh there we go turned on

726
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,559
i will push the button oh and the light

727
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,080
turns on perfect

728
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,559
uh so i need a volunteer to decode

729
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,880
this does anyone want to come up

730
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,039
do some ir hacking kaz come on up sure

731
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,039
do i need to get up there oh yeah yes

732
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,360
please you gotta come up and you gotta

733
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,840
like introduce

734
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,600
hi my name is cass i work with caitlin

735
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,799
and amazon yeah um

736
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,880
so what i want to do is

737
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,360
so there's a function here called learn

738
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,640
new remote

739
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,799
can't push the center button the learn

740
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,960
new remote button yep

741
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,080
cool

742
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,320
now we're going to learn

743
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,760
this remote

744
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,520
so we're going to point it at the ir

745
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,559
receiver

746
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,960
okay and then push the button uh move it

747
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,159
down

748
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,520
there you go oh

749
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,640
and what does it say what does it say

750
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,760
cass it says a 1337

751
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,000
c 9b64

752
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,600
right and so we got it that's the

753
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,000
address that's the address is 1337

754
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,840
obviously elite and then the command is

755
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,720
64. uh so why don't you repeat it at the

756
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,799
um at this ir receiver okay

757
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,559
turn on the light

758
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,240
there it works

759
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,919
yeah so we not only decoded yeah

760
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,960
uh so the frequency of the ir is always

761
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,360
the same pretty much ir is ir

762
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,799
so this is

763
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,399
this is almost like visible light like i

764
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,720
said it's using an led to transmit it's

765
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,279
not using a antenna it's just blinking

766
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,960
an led

767
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,520
uh we'll get into antennas a little bit

768
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,840
i mean

769
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
right

770
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,200
the flipper the flipper will read the ir

771
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,360
and if it's a common standard like nec

772
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,880
or panasonic

773
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,039
it will decode it in this case i was

774
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,880
using nec

775
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,080
address 1337.

776
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,039
right exactly and then it can replay it

777
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:47,840
so

778
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,799
um i have an actual ir device here

779
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,080
uh let's see where can we plug this in

780
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,960
that is not apple

781
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,519
well this unplugged is plugged into the

782
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,799
power supply here

783
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,760
okay cool we got lights and everything

784
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,240
awesome bluetooth mode it's righteous

785
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,440
mode i don't even know what that means

786
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,799
but it's awesome okay

787
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,640
so

788
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,480
uh now now this is running

789
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,240
uh there is there is a remote here as

790
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,080
well it runs

791
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,519
uh ir does anyone want to try uh hacking

792
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,080
this device

793
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,840
anybody

794
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,840
yeah yeah come on

795
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,720
all right you're going to push learn new

796
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,240
remote

797
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,880
okay so

798
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,919
yeah you're good

799
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,279
learning remote

800
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,240
uh push the center button this one yeah

801
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,440
there you go now push the on off uh this

802
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,799
one the top button

803
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,240
it's just true

804
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,360
there you go

805
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,919
okay all right and then

806
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,840
zero zero zero

807
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,440
and c

808
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,399
0

809
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,519
45 yep so 45 is the command address is

810
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,720
zero zero

811
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,919
while you play it back at that

812
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,159
and you can learn all the commands on

813
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,399
the remote and then use the flipper nice

814
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,840
to control any ir device so this is a

815
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,960
good real world example of what you

816
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,240
could use on a real device anyway thank

817
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,010
you so much

818
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,120
[Music]

819
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,279
yes does it overwrite the last um

820
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,320
command

821
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,960
i mean you

822
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,840
yeah let's go over this together so

823
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,000
[Music]

824
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
yeah absolutely absolutely so we can we

825
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,880
can if we learn a new remote

826
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,720
we can for example

827
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,799
uh record this button

828
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,840
and then we can save it

829
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,679
and we can give it a name but because

830
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,919
we're lazy we're just gonna save

831
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,919
up

832
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,000
all right

833
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,119
so now we can add a new function

834
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,520
and i'm going to turn off the lasers so

835
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,320
this is going to be the laser turn off

836
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,760
thing okay

837
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,359
so now we have two things in our remote

838
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,199
and it's fully saved so if i want to

839
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,599
turn on the laser i can select the laser

840
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,079
turn on and the laser turns on

841
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,199
or off

842
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,520
or if i want to turn on the leds

843
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,119
leds turn on and off from the flip from

844
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,159
the flipper

845
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,760
and you can save as many remotes as you

846
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,879
want

847
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,119
as long as you have space

848
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,320
yep

849
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,079
and like i said it says it's basically

850
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,639
more stuff so

851
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,040
awesome

852
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,679
yes we are technology professionals

853
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,159
people all right

854
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,800
we know how to use computers all right

855
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,880
uh yeah so we did the party lives all

856
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
right now let's get into some real radio

857
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
so if you look at the flipper

858
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,160
you'll notice that there is a

859
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,359
um

860
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,400
oh come on

861
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,040
we have a question from oh yes

862
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,160
i don't know if you want to check out

863
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,000
something yeah why don't i check the

864
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,400
chat right now um just joining what

865
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,000
would be your preferred method to

866
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
capture the ir signal

867
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,880
from a boundary mode from the bound

868
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,240
response

869
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,760
well you just need to be the special

870
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,640
person

871
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,240
we've already

872
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,560
yeah yeah so anytime you can just you

873
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,800
know get a line of sight i know the

874
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,160
other thing too is

875
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,560
uh so this setup here that i did with

876
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,880
the you know breadboard and the arduino

877
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,960
i mean i have full control over the

878
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,280
remote controls so if i want to do a

879
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,240
deep dive into an ir system

880
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,760
and this is what i would use the flipper

881
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,280
is really good for like very simple

882
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,760
stuff the standard stuff you find

883
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,040
but if you wanted to like develop your

884
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,440
own protocol or if you were doing some

885
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,720
really weird stuff you would you'd

886
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,800
probably want to just use a

887
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,599
microcontroller

888
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,400
all right so sub gigahertz radio what is

889
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,280
this

890
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,560
go away

891
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,520
okay

892
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,839
um

893
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,400
no no

894
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,359
okay okay yes okay so if you look on the

895
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,200
on the flipper zero there's a section

896
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,359
called sub gigahertz radio

897
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:24,960
and this is real radio so this is we're

898
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,800
getting to the real like

899
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,640
antennas going through the air that kind

900
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,560
of stuff am fm

901
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,240
you know decoding

902
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,040
so

903
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,760
if you develop a device like a doorbell

904
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,520
it will get into those a little bit or

905
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,400
any like a garage door opener

906
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,040
you can design your device to send out

907
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,200
an rf signal but only on certain

908
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,480
frequencies it just so happens that the

909
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,320
flipper zero will listen on those

910
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,079
frequencies

911
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,480
and record those signals maybe decode

912
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,079
them maybe not but definitely do a

913
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,880
replay attack uh so in the us uh

914
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,760
frequencies are like 310 to 318

915
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,880
megahertz

916
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,400
usually we see it around 433 megahertz

917
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,800
uh although sometimes you will see 915

918
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,200
or 925 meters um and most of these

919
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
signals are just simple am or fm

920
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,919
transmissions

921
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,320
uh so yeah let's

922
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,320
let's boot up uh sdr here so an sdr is a

923
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,480
software defined radio

924
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,400
uh that means that we are going to be

925
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,760
looking at

926
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,480
raw radio signals going into

927
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,800
the computer

928
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,880
and i'm just going to set up this dipole

929
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,320
here

930
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,240
by the way yeah so people can see there

931
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,280
we go

932
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,599
i'm just going to plug a little dipole

933
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,079
into

934
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,480
oh

935
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,800
okay

936
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,119
thank you yeah this is very complicated

937
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,400
setup

938
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,280
all right so we're going to actually

939
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,640
look at some of the

940
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,520
uh radio waves coming off of a

941
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,960
a little device that you can buy from

942
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,480
the store

943
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,160
so we're going to plug this in this is

944
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
an air spy by the way i highly recommend

945
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,280
these they're a little bit more

946
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
expensive than the

947
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,599
20 sdrs but

948
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,440
they do a fantastic job so

949
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,640
okay cool i think all right this is some

950
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,520
some heavy-grade engineering right here

951
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,040
exit uh

952
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,960
so we're gonna go back to the desktop

953
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,200
we're gonna open up sdr sharp

954
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,200
sure

955
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,520
by the way the demo gods are not going

956
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,440
to like today

957
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,880
so

958
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,720
expect bad things to happen uh so we're

959
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,240
going to go to

960
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,760
i'll go away

961
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,119
we're going to go we're going to set the

962
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,240
frequency to 433 megahertz

963
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,760
three

964
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,280
four

965
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,960
three three

966
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,359
i'm going to turn down the audio

967
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,119
and we're gonna switch to the air spy

968
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,040
r2 perfect

969
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,160
play

970
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,400
there we go so what you're seeing is

971
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,720
around 433 megahertz

972
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,960
and nothing's happening

973
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,119
all right this is just the

974
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,560
noise floor in this room which is

975
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,400
actually really good

976
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,760
i wish i could do more radio stuff in

977
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,440
here um

978
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,599
so here's a doorbell

979
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,520
a wireless doorbell

980
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,880
and i'm just going to ring the doorbell

981
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,160
there's no batteries in the doorbell

982
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,920
itself

983
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,560
oh what's that

984
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,079
something just happened

985
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,520
where was that

986
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,720
it's a little to the right so it's a

987
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,680
little higher frequency so

988
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,040
433 let's try 490

989
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,040
two

990
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,599
yeah 490. 433 points

991
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,200
192 megahertz

992
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,480
something's happening let's actually

993
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,400
let's take a listen so it's in

994
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,640
i'll put into am mode

995
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,359
this is going to be a little staticky

996
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,480
no i don't actually hear anything

997
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,720
my audio is clearly on no

998
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,640
oh well if the audio works and the demo

999
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,079
gods were not mad at me we would

1000
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,520
actually hear some some audio

1001
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,960
433.92 megahertz

1002
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,599
so what we're seeing here so um

1003
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,680
if we look at this this is a spectrogram

1004
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,240
so if and that's a four-year transform

1005
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,320
so these are frequencies lower than

1006
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,720
433.92

1007
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,640
these are frequencies higher

1008
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,839
and then we're seeing where the signal

1009
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,440
strength is right here

1010
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,839
so we do see that there's a signal

1011
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:50,839
coming from the

1012
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,440
doorbell uh now normally if the doorbell

1013
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,119
had batteries

1014
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,599
it would

1015
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,319
do that

1016
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
yeah let's uh

1017
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,319
put some batteries in the scientific

1018
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,720
this might be a little loud

1019
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,920
try it again ready

1020
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,920
yep

1021
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,800
all right so let's check the doorbell

1022
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,040
uh let me check batteries again

1023
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
constantly doing ourselves

1024
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,200
so one way you could do this is if we we

1025
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,520
have the sdr right

1026
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,520
uh so we could go into something called

1027
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,800
the universal radio hacker

1028
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,000
universal radio hacker is great if

1029
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,520
you're lazy like me and don't want to

1030
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,200
write your own dsps for everything you

1031
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,880
need to code

1032
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,160
so we're just going to go and record a

1033
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,480
signal

1034
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,720
we're going to record from the air spy

1035
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,319
r2

1036
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,720
oh look at that it's already set to

1037
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,640
433.92 because it's a common frequency

1038
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,400
for these devices

1039
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,440
uh we'll just start recording

1040
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,920
we'll record the signal

1041
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,480
it's done so we'll stop

1042
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,200
we'll save it to the desktop

1043
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,720
uh let's see desktop that's good enough

1044
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,319
okay save

1045
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,599
close out of this

1046
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,200
and because this is awesome software

1047
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,960
it's automatically gonna load

1048
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,880
and try to decode the signal

1049
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,520
which it already did so actually we'll

1050
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,599
process again

1051
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,040
there we go

1052
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,680
so it's decoded all the ones and zeros

1053
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,480
uh that was sent out uh in fact we can

1054
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,359
look at the modulated signal here

1055
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,839
zoom in

1056
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,440
sorry let's

1057
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,599
make this bigger

1058
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,720
it's not really apparently

1059
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,920
there we go okay

1060
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,920
so

1061
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,200
there we go

1062
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,480
so we'll see what's happening is that

1063
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,560
we're seeing the same signals and if

1064
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,480
you're familiar with digital electronics

1065
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,560
this is like very familiar uh this is

1066
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,720
because it's using amplitude modulation

1067
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,240
we're sending out these square waves and

1068
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,000
from the square waves

1069
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,160
from the infrared from the sorry from

1070
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,640
the 433 megahertz radio wave

1071
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,880
we're getting uh data out in fact we can

1072
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,560
analyze it over here

1073
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,359
and view it in hex

1074
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,960
and we can repeat this to bring the

1075
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,480
doorbell however

1076
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,040
the flipper actually is easier

1077
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,800
so i need another volunteer

1078
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,640
who wants to come up

1079
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,760
what do i do

1080
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,760
oh yeah okay you're gonna hold this yes

1081
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,640
and uh we're gonna

1082
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,280
go in front of the camera here

1083
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,680
and we're gonna go to sub gigahertz

1084
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,520
all right and we're on bead okay so i'm

1085
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,440
going to push read

1086
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,560
and then i want you to push the button

1087
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,680
so okay i'm

1088
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,760
push the button

1089
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,599
release it uh now keep pushing it

1090
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,240
now release

1091
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
try again

1092
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,520
release

1093
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,640
there we go

1094
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,160
it got it

1095
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,480
so

1096
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,280
okay so hold on to this sure onto the

1097
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,400
filter

1098
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,359
i'm going to put the batteries back in

1099
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,040
uh push the center button yes

1100
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,319
release it yeah push and release

1101
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,480
uh quicker

1102
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,280
oh let me see what's going on here

1103
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,599
uh

1104
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,040
oh there we go

1105
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,480
sorry i don't know why that was being

1106
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,119
weird so push the right button

1107
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,520
the right arrow right there yep percent

1108
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,960
release two yep

1109
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,880
really quickly

1110
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,800
one more time oh oh i think you pushed

1111
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,400
the wrong thing oh sure that's okay

1112
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,920
right arrow really quickly

1113
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,880
oh why is that not

1114
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
oh save sorry push the center button

1115
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,440
really quickly

1116
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,079
center button really quickly

1117
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,200
oh why is it not working

1118
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,839
do it again

1119
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,280
yep should be centered or it has to be

1120
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,520
hard

1121
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,000
i'll try one more time so if this

1122
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,359
doesn't work i'm going to teach people a

1123
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,880
little trick

1124
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,720
uh we're going to go to read raw

1125
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,720
take out the battery

1126
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,680
um when i tell you to push the button

1127
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,440
the center button uh push the center

1128
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,800
button this one yeah

1129
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,800
oh oh right just push the center button

1130
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,040
and then let go

1131
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,599
uh try again

1132
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,200
oh uh what's going on let me see

1133
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,000
oh oh it's on send uh erase sorry about

1134
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,760
that all right push the center button

1135
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,319
just let go

1136
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,000
is it picking up yes it can now push it

1137
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,520
again

1138
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,920
okay so pointed if we point it towards

1139
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,680
the camera sorry you'll see it got a

1140
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,680
signal at the beginning

1141
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,520
now we're going to

1142
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,040
push this push the center button again

1143
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,880
what we did right there was a very basic

1144
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,359
replay attack it recorded the 433

1145
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,119
megahertz signal

1146
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,400
and it's

1147
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,160
just it didn't even like do any recoding

1148
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,760
it just recorded this what was what it

1149
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,839
was seeing and then replayed the wav

1150
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,839
file back essentially and we were able

1151
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,079
to get the remote sorry the

1152
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,839
doorbell to ring and this is a great way

1153
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:46,960
to annoy your neighbors by the way if

1154
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,520
you if they have a wireless doorbell

1155
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,440
you can record their signals on like a

1156
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,160
pack rf or your flipper 0 and you know

1157
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,040
just

1158
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,520
2 a.m suddenly have neighbors have you

1159
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,319
know

1160
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,240
rings that of people that aren't there

1161
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,400
so now of course if you're making a

1162
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,839
security device you would use something

1163
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,440
like a rolling code and everything like

1164
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,960
that i'm just kidding so um

1165
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,280
so here we have

1166
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,359
a locking mechanism for like drawers or

1167
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,720
windows

1168
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,720
and the way this works is you would

1169
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,480
attach this to like a wall

1170
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,400
or the inside of your desk and it's just

1171
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,680
a magnet

1172
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,119
and at the other side here there's

1173
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,280
something called a read switch

1174
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,680
which if the if it sees a magnet nearby

1175
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,359
it closes the switch

1176
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,240
um and it can detect that the alarm is

1177
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,000
is closed or the drawer is closed or the

1178
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,920
window is closed

1179
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,160
so um and it has this 433.92

1180
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,599
megahertz remote for locking and

1181
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,240
unlocking the device

1182
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,040
all right so report

1183
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,079
so obviously what we've got to do

1184
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,880
is we'll put in some

1185
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,560
and by the way this is going to get very

1186
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,760
loud

1187
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,560
i hate this thing this is very loud um

1188
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,760
but i'll show you how this is supposed

1189
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,880
to work

1190
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,310
so if we have a um

1191
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:09,040
[Music]

1192
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,040
when it's when it's when the drawer is

1193
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,160
closed

1194
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,359
we can then push the lock button

1195
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,760
push the lock button

1196
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,440
okay it's that three beeps means it's

1197
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,359
locked and if we were to move this away

1198
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,960
it's gonna be really loud and really

1199
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,000
annoying

1200
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,359
all right ready

1201
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,640
one two three

1202
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,280
right so

1203
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,960
we need to have this we need to hack

1204
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,800
this so it doesn't do that anymore

1205
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,400
um so actually we'll

1206
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,319
keep the batteries out for now

1207
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,440
um

1208
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,839
do we have another volunteer

1209
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,839
uh yeah come on

1210
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,880
so we're gonna do the same thing again

1211
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,720
that's it

1212
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,319
uh and you're gonna

1213
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,440
select read raw

1214
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,760
okay and then you're gonna push the

1215
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,400
record button

1216
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,880
and then push it again all right now we

1217
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,119
have a recording of the disarm

1218
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,359
button

1219
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,319
okay

1220
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,400
now let's try this again we're gonna

1221
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,319
arm the arm the security device

1222
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,559
i meant to do that that was

1223
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,280
okay we're gonna lock it

1224
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,960
replay it replay the unlock

1225
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,079
now it's unlocked

1226
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,480
thank you

1227
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,960
and by the way there's no rolling codes

1228
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,079
normally the way you would get around

1229
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,200
this is you would have like rolling

1230
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,720
codes on your devices

1231
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,800
uh this of course being the finest

1232
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,880
security device from china no matter how

1233
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,359
many times you lock it

1234
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,920
you can just replay from the flipper

1235
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,920
uh

1236
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,640
so

1237
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,839
no rolling codes that's awesome

1238
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,200
right right so

1239
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,119
yeah so this this is an example of

1240
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,079
security gone bad uh by our our fine our

1241
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,240
fine friends at the uh

1242
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,680
you know chinese

1243
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,359
um

1244
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,200
you know five dollar chinese lot company

1245
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,079
so

1246
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,720
uh

1247
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,280
so but but however um just because

1248
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,480
something has a rolling code doesn't

1249
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,599
mean you can't use the flipper to get

1250
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,119
around it

1251
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,400
you oh yes

1252
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,480
um how many frequencies

1253
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,839
good question so one it depends where

1254
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,440
you are so like i said different

1255
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,760
countries different areas have different

1256
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,359
frequencies that it can

1257
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,119
transmit on however the flipper 0

1258
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,000
specifically can only transmit on around

1259
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,200
310

1260
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,319
around 433 megahertz and around 915

1261
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,400
megahertz that's it so it doesn't have a

1262
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,720
full sdr it has a little chip inside

1263
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,720
that that does

1264
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,880
you know device

1265
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,200
stuff yes

1266
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,079
uh so one one lesson i really want

1267
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,440
people to take away here is that even

1268
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,440
though the flipper is like a really cool

1269
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,480
device

1270
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,079
there is always

1271
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,760
something better for each individual

1272
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,720
task

1273
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,200
so for 433 megahertz

1274
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,640
hacking i highly recommend

1275
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,480
picking up one of these this is a hack

1276
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,839
rf

1277
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,559
it will uh not only you know do the same

1278
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,319
sort of recording we did it will play

1279
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,559
back it will work on all frequencies

1280
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,800
between like zero hertz and like six

1281
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,079
gigahertz

1282
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,319
uh it does require

1283
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,280
it is it's not the best sdr to be honest

1284
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,240
um

1285
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,440
but

1286
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,720
you know it'll it'll do all the

1287
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,160
frequencies

1288
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,359
unlike the clipper zero which is

1289
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:56,319
specifically for these kind of devices

1290
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,079
uh yes um how do you know which

1291
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,839
modulation there's like every time

1292
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,040
you're doing it you're getting it off

1293
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,240
the first part

1294
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,079
all right so the nice thing about a

1295
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,920
simple replay attack is you don't

1296
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,079
actually have to demodulate

1297
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,520
uh so if we look back here at um

1298
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,960
we're going to go back to the camera

1299
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,640
yep if we go back to the camera what's

1300
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,559
happening is

1301
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,559
when we record a signal

1302
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,040
we're going to go to read raw

1303
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,359
we're going to record

1304
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,000
oops i don't realize the batteries are

1305
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,599
still there but all it's doing is it's

1306
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,680
picking up the raw radio waves and then

1307
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,200
playing it back it doesn't matter if

1308
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,880
it's amplitude

1309
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,119
modulated frequency modulated or phase

1310
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,400
modulated

1311
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,760
it doesn't even know what it picked up

1312
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,359
it's just going to play back what it

1313
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,119
hurt essentially

1314
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,119
uh for

1315
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,440
if you actually want to decode it

1316
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,319
uh usually on these these

1317
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,160
typical these kind of devices it's

1318
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,680
always going to be either some sort of

1319
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,440
amplitude modulation or frequency

1320
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,160
modulation very simple once in a while

1321
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,440
you'll come up with like phase

1322
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,880
modulation

1323
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,599
uh that's very rare um

1324
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,440
for these types of devices most of like

1325
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,359
most digital devices you use

1326
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,640
will have a phase modulation actually

1327
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,880
but for these chief devices they're as

1328
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,400
cheap as possible

1329
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,920
uh so if you go to like the universal

1330
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,760
radio hacker once again

1331
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,000
um

1332
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,880
like i said this tool is really great if

1333
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,200
you don't want to write your own dsps

1334
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,040
because what will happen if we open up

1335
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,839
uh what we recorded earlier

1336
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:35,040
all right let's see where it is

1337
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,319
what's on the desktop

1338
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,880
desktop

1339
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,240
uh it actually automatically

1340
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,960
yes actually it will automatically

1341
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,280
try to decode the signal for you

1342
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,359
so if you're if you're really new or if

1343
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:52,880
you're lazy like me and you don't want

1344
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,319
to go through the process of figuring

1345
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,760
out what exactly uh is going on uh or

1346
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,520
may go into like unique radio and like

1347
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,000
do the processing uh if you want the raw

1348
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,839
like just bits and data

1349
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,680
universal radio hackers a good

1350
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,800
good first step for these kind of

1351
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,480
devices

1352
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,240
and like i said it will select automatic

1353
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,680
so it says here

1354
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,559
the

1355
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,240
modulation is afk or amplitude shift key

1356
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,520
um

1357
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,079
you also have frequency shift key and uh

1358
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,640
phase shift key

1359
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,160
yes universal radio hacker is completely

1360
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,839
free open source you can download it

1361
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,520
from github

1362
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,280
and it's on all operating systems

1363
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,599
okay so let me pull back up the

1364
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,559
presentation

1365
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:43,920
okay

1366
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,280
uh oh yeah so here's something that's

1367
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,559
really interesting

1368
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,240
uh yeah so tesla recently uh it turned

1369
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,760
out that

1370
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,520
to open their charge port they use

1371
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,119
433.92 megahertz and they didn't use

1372
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,440
rolling codes so you can do the same

1373
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,280
thing to go into

1374
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,119
uh the charging port of any tesla

1375
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,119
vehicle so we have a tesla outside

1376
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,060
[Applause]

1377
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,680
uh to oakland and there was a truck full

1378
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,920
of brand new teslas i used my flipper on

1379
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,400
it all of them

1380
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,240
here's the black magic and here's the

1381
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,680
one i really wanted to talk about

1382
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,200
so okay so

1383
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,520
um rfid

1384
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,559
if anyone's ever seen rfid it is black

1385
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:13,520
magic

1386
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,440
and i spent some time reverse

1387
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,119
engineering it figure out exactly how it

1388
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,599
works and i'm gonna demystify the whole

1389
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:20,880
thing because it's really stupidly

1390
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,640
simple but it just seems like magic

1391
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,040
because you you have a card

1392
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,359
and it has like no power source you put

1393
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,359
it up to a like reader and just through

1394
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,359
the air it magically like sends data out

1395
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,359
and it's like what's going on

1396
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:34,400
uh so

1397
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,839
so

1398
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,839
outside actually right now

1399
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,079
yeah uh so we could either do it now or

1400
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,599
after the presentation let me join the

1401
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,599
meeting with uh

1402
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,000
with uh my phone i'm looking do you want

1403
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,079
to do it right now yeah

1404
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,119
do you have a flipper set up for it

1405
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,559
right now

1406
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,880
max has it okay let's do it let's do it

1407
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,720
let's do it

1408
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,040
so right there

1409
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,890
okay oh okay intermission time

1410
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:04,960
[Music]

1411
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,240
intermission while we get ready for the

1412
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,558
tesla

1413
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,359
no i like the i like it when things are

1414
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,720
naturally progressed

1415
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,799
it's gonna be either that one or the one

1416
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,799
under

1417
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,240
so you're the one trying to remove it

1418
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,240
duh i control my own flipper i was

1419
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,200
wondering why this was alright

1420
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,119
so the top of the bottom one it's one of

1421
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,359
the other so different different testers

1422
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,440
use different signals okay but most of

1423
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,960
them respond to one or the other we'll

1424
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,720
just try it out yeah

1425
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,720
and where did you get that signal in the

1426
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,440
first place to put in there it's on uh i

1427
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,839
think the fifth

1428
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,520
there's also when i made that i use the

1429
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,160
arduino ir remote library and you can

1430
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,520
basically

1431
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,839
copy any remote on the market

1432
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,160
so like any protocol anything you can do

1433
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,799
just with an arduino and those little

1434
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,359
stupid ir receivers by the way by the

1435
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,000
way um once again chinese manufacturing

1436
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,079
and its finest uh i can find it

1437
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,400
here we go

1438
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,799
so i got these uh receivers came in a

1439
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,640
pack of six

1440
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,240
um

1441
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,520
can anyone see what's wrong with this

1442
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,119
one

1443
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,000
i don't know if anyone can see clearly

1444
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,599
anyway they put on the component backers

1445
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,680
so like four components they had one job

1446
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,640
and it's on backwards

1447
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,440
so quality control yeah i know excellent

1448
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,240
quality control right there

1449
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,839
so are we are we still planning on going

1450
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,760
out and yeah we're ready i'm ready let's

1451
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,079
go

1452
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,779
[Music]

1453
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,260
and we're about to get my tesla back

1454
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,730
[Laughter]

1455
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:10,800

okay can you uh can you check if uh the

1457
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,119
video is showing on on the screen over

1458
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,280
there

1459
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,480
where it's the top part yeah

1460
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,480
no it's right here

1461
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,000
where is it

1462
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,720

just

1464
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,720
just waiting for his call

1465
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,160

all right cool oh that's

1474
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,319
yeah with the flipper

1475
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,799
that's a little dark

1476
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,880
oh there's eddie right there

1477

what's the consequences

1478
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,079
wow flip for zero yeah

1479
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,680
can i close it too easy is clicking a

1480
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,839
button

1481
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,119
you know what i want what do you want to

1482
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,079
know what what does the driver see when

1483
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,720
that happens rude if anything sorry oh

1484
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,720
like as if i'm in the car right

1485
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,640
are you in the car does the car tell you

1486
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,480
anything because you're not near a port

1487
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,559
let's see but the door open okay we'll

1488
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,079
check it out real quick we'll close it

1489
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,520
and then send it again

1490
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,040
okay because i can't believe that this

1491
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,559
is this is that dumb

1492
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,559
that anybody can open it and you get no

1493
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,240

rolling codes

1501
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,119
all right so this is how we roll so

1502
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,079
we missed this

1503
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,359
little quieter

1504
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:14,480

want um

1509
01:02:53,710 --> 01:03:00,839
[Music]

1510
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,520
okay so that we should just focus on

1511
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,000
okay that's fine do you put malware on

1512
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,079
my system uh obviously all right

1513
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,079
excellent

1514
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,720
should be pretty good uh

1515
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,520
to answer shannon's question

1516
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,920
would it open if the car was in motion

1517
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,920
uh so far i haven't seen it open when

1518
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,640
the car's in motion

1519
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,920
that's definitely something we can test

1520
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,839
that's so nice of you

1521
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,559
all right so um rfid so this is the

1522
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:06,160
blackmagic stuff this is the stuff that

1523
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,079
like how the

1524
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,319
hell does this work yep you have a card

1525
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,640
it's not powered you hold it in a reader

1526
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,559
somehow like magically data gets all hit

1527
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,440
and you're let in okay what's going on

1528
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,520
um and actually before i change this

1529
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,680
change slides i do want to point out

1530
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,359
uh that if you look at these cards

1531
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,599
really closely there's some numbers here

1532
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,000
if you're ever given a uh rfid card and

1533
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,920
there are numbers write those down those

1534
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,160
are usually the codes to get into the

1535
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,079
building uh it's right there for you to

1536
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,079
take oh actually can we try the access

1537
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,319
controls here oh we absolutely could

1538
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:39,920
have been

1539
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,200
uh

1540
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,280
not every access control is necessarily

1541
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,960
vulnerable but uh we can take a look

1542
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,920
so it shows the camera

1543
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,440
so it's my camera let's see um

1544
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,559
[Music]

1545
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,559
um

1546
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,839
um

1547
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,599
um

1548
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,280
push to start should have rolling codes

1549
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,079
uh the push to start i believe he uses

1550
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,079
long-range rfid

1551
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:39,039
although it could be wrong i haven't

1552
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,880
looked too deeply into it there are

1553
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,559
types of rfid

1554
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,640
uh that will work over longer range if

1555
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,839
the

1556
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,079
transmitter is powered

1557
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:49,280
uh however we're just going to be

1558
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,880
looking at the unpowered types where you

1559
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,799
just push you know put your card over

1560
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,240
the

1561
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,160
over the reader and then something

1562
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,039
magically stuff stuff appears okay so

1563
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,559
like i said if you see numbers on the

1564
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,520
card write those down

1565
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:06,720
what was the hardware device you were

1566
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,960
using earlier to show the spectrum as

1567
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,359
the sdr again please oh yes i'll show

1568
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:14,480
that so i was using a

1569
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,799
uh airspun

1570
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,200
so this is one of my favorite sdrs it's

1571
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,119
receive only

1572
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,359
and it basically has the same

1573
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:30,400
frequency

1574
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,119
range as like those cheap rtl str's but

1575
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,799
i find it does a very good job of

1576
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,319
reducing noise

1577
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,720
um and also you can get a little adapter

1578
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,240
um in the back

1579
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,480
and if you have a 10 megahertz a lab

1580
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,799
clock uh you can uh

1581
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,520
like a atomic clock you can hook it up

1582
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,319
to the back here and get spot on signal

1583
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:51,440
reception

1584
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,359
so you have to worry about signal drift

1585
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,480
so this is the

1586
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,440
air spy r2 fantastic sdr

1587
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,640
or uhf vhf

1588
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,880
and okay

1589
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,880
all right so um

1590
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,720
yeah let's continue

1591
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,319
all right so what's going on how does

1592
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,960
rfid work okay so i need to move it away

1593
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,680
so you can see how this works

1594
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,760
okay so uh if you have an rfid reader

1595
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,359
this is we're looking at the 125

1596
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,760
kilohertz time type which is the low

1597
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,400
frequency rfid

1598
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,760
which i believe are these yes um

1599
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,760
so you would have a

1600
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,000
a reader and you would put like a key or

1601
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,319
a bob on top and read it

1602
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,760
um and the way it works is that you have

1603
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,480
inside a little transmitter and it's

1604
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,400
always transmitting at 125 kilohertz

1605
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,000
uh connected to the

1606
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,200
connected to the transmitter is a little

1607
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,680
receiver filter thingy um

1608
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,119
basically what it's doing is that it's

1609
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:56,480
looking at the envelope

1610
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,079
of the power usage so when there is

1611
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,160
something nearby it's going to

1612
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,839
draw a little bit of power

1613
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:03,920
from the antenna and that's going to

1614
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,160
change the shape of the sine wave

1615
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,200
slightly

1616
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,640
and that's how it's getting back the

1617
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,319
data

1618
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,799
and let's take a really quick look at

1619
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:16,399
how the rfid card or reader works

1620
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:19,279
so this is what a typical dipole antenna

1621
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,279
looks like normally this would actually

1622
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,319
be in a circle or like a rectangle but

1623
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:25,920
for simplicity's sake we're just having

1624
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,479
a very simple dipole and it receives

1625
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,600
this 125 kilohertz signal

1626
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,960
that

1627
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,120
powers the device that's all it needs

1628
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,640
um because it's getting like one or one

1629
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,399
or two volts nearby

1630
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,000
uh when it's like right on top of the

1631
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,319
transmitter that's enough to power it up

1632
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,000
there's some data and logic inside

1633
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
usually some code

1634
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,839
um and that's going to turn on and off a

1635
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,920
resistor that resistor is going to

1636
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,799
bridge both sides of the transmitter

1637
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:56,238
and every antenna can both receive and

1638
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:57,679
transmit

1639
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:00,479
so what happens is it gets 125 kilohertz

1640
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:01,679
signal

1641
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:02,640
it

1642
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,880
sorts the you know storage antenna with

1643
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,479
the transistor

1644
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,479
and you get

1645
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,880
the same signal coming in

1646
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,319
causing it to emanate causing what's

1647
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,920
called back scattering

1648
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,319
and that's how it's able to power itself

1649
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,479
so it's this uses the signal that comes

1650
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,318
in and it emanates the same thing away

1651
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:28,319
and so we can take a look inside

1652
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,080
uh this is what uh what's inside here um

1653
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,158
so i i took this part did a lot of

1654
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:37,759
analysis so up here is where the

1655
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,479
um input comes in so it reads from the

1656
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,600
it reads from this antenna and transmits

1657
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,560
uh

1658
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,040
sends the signal through this um it goes

1659
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,640
through these diodes

1660
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,399
uh it goes into this tank circuit up

1661
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,158
here and goes into this chip this chip

1662
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,000
basically handles everything

1663
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,760
it's like it's it's a single chip

1664
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,800
solution

1665
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,560
and then the data comes out to the usb

1666
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,080
and of course there's

1667
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,640
a signal going out to this uh antenna

1668
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,400
um and if we look at the signal coming

1669
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,000
out of the antenna

1670
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,440
it's uh

1671
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,000
yeah well exactly under 25 kilohertz

1672
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,679
uh and it's 23.6 volts so it's it's a

1673
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,679
good amount of power going through it

1674
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:22,800
rms including volts so uh

1675
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,960
don't don't worry about it actually

1676
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,960
um

1677
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,560
and if we look inside like a little key

1678
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,679
fob

1679
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,440
you'll see exactly what i was talking

1680
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,080
about where you have two leads

1681
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,239
going into the little chip here this

1682
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:37,520
little black

1683
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,640
gooey

1684
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,480
chip super cheap

1685
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,840
one cent chip

1686
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,400
um and then this is the antenna

1687
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,840
around it

1688
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,960
essentially acting as the light

1689
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,760
that's another up close picture where

1690
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,520
you can more clearly see that

1691
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,480
the leads from the antennas coming in

1692
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,199
to that

1693
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,480
and like i said inside there's just a

1694
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,320
little transistor that will short the

1695
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,679
two leads together which is how you get

1696
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,840
the backscatter

1697
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,080
anyway let's let's see what's going on

1698
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,440
with

1699
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,280
with one of these rfid readers um

1700
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,719
let me

1701
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:17,440
grab a

1702
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,080
cable man

1703
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,360
so i'm gonna

1704
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,120
what this does is this works on very

1705
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,400
specific types of rfid uh cards or

1706
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,640
readers um

1707
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,159
and then we'll act as like a keyboard

1708
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,840
there we go plug it in all right now

1709
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,159
it's ready to go

1710
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:42,719
um and now

1711
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,480
i'm going to need

1712
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,600
i'm going to put it um

1713
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,960
ah here it is

1714
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,760
okay so this is another sdr

1715
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,040
uh we're obviously working a lot with

1716
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,640
radio so we're using a lot of

1717
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,159
software-defined radios this is called

1718
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,159
an air spy hf

1719
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,239
this will let us receive signals as low

1720
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:03,840
as 120 135 kilohertz

1721
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,400
and attached to it is an rf pro

1722
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,600
now these are highly technical devices

1723
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,320
uh you usually get them in entire packs

1724
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,920
and what you would usually use these for

1725
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,239
is that if you have let's say a circuit

1726
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,320
and you're submitting it to the fcc

1727
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,719
and you want to find out if

1728
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:22,560
like a certain trace is giving off too

1729
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,719
much electromagnetic radiation you can

1730
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,960
run the probe along the trace

1731
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,960
and view all the rs spectrum and and um

1732
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,880
and of course you know these are highly

1733
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,040
specialized devices um

1734
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,280
you know you could if you go onto amazon

1735
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,040
it's gonna cost you all of like eight

1736
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,080
bucks to get a whole box of these stuff

1737
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,520
so definitely worth your time or you can

1738
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,719
just make your own if you have some

1739
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,400
spare copper

1740
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,159
yes what is it

1741
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:52,159
uh rf probe yeah radio frequency probe

1742
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,560
so i have one of those probes attached

1743
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,840
to my

1744
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,199
um

1745
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,800
airspy hf

1746
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,159
essentially what i'm doing is i'm

1747
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,080
turning my sdr into a spectrum analyzer

1748
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,520
and we're going to view

1749
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,920
the radio waves coming off of this

1750
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,920
reader so i'm going to plug this back in

1751
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:15,840
so the

1752
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,880
traceability test for confinements

1753
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,440
yes yes yes so when you uh submit to the

1754
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,600
fcc and if you've ever seen a product

1755
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,840
that says like this is fcc approved

1756
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,120
they've done this they've taken these

1757
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,640
probes they've gone throughout the

1758
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,000
device and they tried to figure it out

1759
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,360
where it's emitting a lot of rf spectrum

1760
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:37,280
so we'll open up sdr shark again

1761
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,440
we are running the airspy hf let me set

1762
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,880
that down there we're going to turn off

1763
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,320
the audio

1764
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,320
we're going to

1765
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,760
set this to

1766
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,239
a 135 kilohertz so that's

1767
01:13:58,239 --> 01:13:59,679
0

1768
01:13:59,679 --> 01:13:59,930
one

1769
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:01,920
[Music]

1770
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,040
three

1771
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,360
five

1772
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,960
all right can i get a volunteer

1773
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,759
who wants to come up and program

1774
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,800
okay so just hold that there i'm gonna

1775
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,800
start the i'm gonna start the

1776
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,960
insert

1777
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,840
the

1778
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,880
pizza there we go all right now move the

1779
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,960
probe close to this let's see what

1780
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,480
happens

1781
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,480
oh there we go you see that on the

1782
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,560
screen oh awesome

1783
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,560
yeah it's like heat down yeah it's like

1784
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,239
a heat map so we see around 125

1785
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,360
kilohertz

1786
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,000
there's a signal yeah you can take a

1787
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,120
look for yourself

1788
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,880
if you get it really close

1789
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,800
you can see exactly

1790
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,159
the signals that are coming out and most

1791
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,080
of those so so what you're seeing here

1792
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,560
is there's a main signal around 125 135

1793
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,280
kilohertz um and then there are these

1794
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,040
sort of transient spikes because it's

1795
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,679
really hard to get a perfect sign weight

1796
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:03,600
uh but you can always identify oh this

1797
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,840
is the big one right here and then if we

1798
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,199
were to do the math we'd find this is

1799
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,880
like a perfect multiple you know or

1800
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,880
something and that's what we're seeing

1801
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:11,840
on these

1802
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,159
uh so we can definitely see the rf going

1803
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:19,120
up now here's the magic uh one second

1804
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,880
i'm going to give you something

1805
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,400
so this is

1806
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,360
a key fob

1807
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:39,799
125 or 135 kilohertz keypad

1808
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,640
so what i want to do is i want you to

1809
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,800
hold the key fob

1810
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,480
on the other side of the probe it's on

1811
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,320
the top side of the probe

1812
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,840
and move it towards the reader again

1813
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,679
let's see what happens

1814
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,080
oh attention oh no get it really close

1815
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,080
get it really close no you can touch it

1816
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,080
much more probably yeah

1817
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,719
whoa what's going on

1818
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,719
that's the back scatter

1819
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,239
so when you have the

1820
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,320
well yeah when you have the

1821
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,480
when you have the keypad near the reader

1822
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,120
it's just going wild it is sending out

1823
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,520
all this backscatter

1824
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,040
and

1825
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,640
i did not find

1826
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,120
anything online about how to decode this

1827
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,880
uh however

1828
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,400
however i figured it out it took me like

1829
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,719
a day

1830
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,480
it works either yeah it works either

1831
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,560
side yeah

1832
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,239
oh well she's having too much fun i

1833
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:36,400
don't know

1834
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,320
i know but isn't that cool you can see

1835
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,679
what's going on and this is what i

1836
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:40,880
really wanted to show everyone because

1837
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,400
it really takes the

1838
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,800
mystery out of out of how these rfid

1839
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,320
readers work is that

1840
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,280
um

1841
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,600
it's it's taking in that sensor signal

1842
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,360
um and then it's

1843
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,840
basically reflecting it back and it's so

1844
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,080
dumb and so ridiculous it just backs

1845
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,760
headers all over the place

1846
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,000
but it is modulated and we can get data

1847
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,880
off of

1848
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,560
the device so will that work with your

1849
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,679
credit card

1850
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:08,080
uh that is nfc and yes

1851
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,480
uh so this is specifically a hundred and

1852
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,239
you know 35 kilohertz

1853
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,280
uh our low frequency rfid and so that's

1854
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,800
only for like little tags like you would

1855
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,560
put this like if you were

1856
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,239
maintaining a

1857
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,520
warehouse

1858
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,880
and you just wanted like tags on

1859
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,960
everything

1860
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,360
and you'll just do those apple challenge

1861
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,880
i don't know what uh apple tags are like

1862
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,120
for tracking right that's different

1863
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,960
so rfid is

1864
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,080
normally like if you're in like a

1865
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,360
storage system

1866
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,480
you know and you have to keep track of

1867
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,159
like a thousand different products

1868
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,960
you can just scan them and then

1869
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,960
yeah this is they're very simple um

1870
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,800
we'll get into uh and it's

1871
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,400
oh season a little bit but it's the same

1872
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,799
principle

1873
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,120
that question yes can we block that

1874
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,080
would shoot metal let's try it

1875
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,280
uh let's see

1876
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,360
i will um

1877
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,040
let's i'll put my phone in the way let's

1878
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,199
just see

1879
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,679
we still see something what if we put a

1880
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,080
put this on top yeah

1881
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,080
uh it blocks actually it blocks most of

1882
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,640
it but this is a lot of layers yeah

1883
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,040
slim it down slim it down let's see what

1884
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,199
do we have

1885
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:21,120
yeah we need tin oil

1886
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,760
uh we could try using

1887
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,120
yeah

1888
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,320
let me try using this cord

1889
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,080
yeah no it's blocking it

1890
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,159
if you go like on this side over here

1891
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,839
yeah no it's blocking it um

1892
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,560
because this is such a location

1893
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,960
what is this

1894
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,960
oh

1895
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:03,159
wow

1896
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,280
[Music]

1897
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,080
yeah exactly

1898
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,239
let's try this one so keep in mind this

1899
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:41,920
is for low frequencies it might work

1900
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,400
better on nfc devices

1901
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,000
oh would all these kind of card are you

1902
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,679
sure yeah i guess dude

1903
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,679
oh but they expect people would not use

1904
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:01,600
it this close somebody would have to

1905
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,480
like

1906
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,800
you know rub it on your

1907
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,920
wallet so there are like giants

1908
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,120
um like rfid like transmitters receivers

1909
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,400
that you can use to get stuff at a

1910
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,480
slightly larger distance

1911
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:18,199
but these are unpowered

1912
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,159
they buy like a garage door reader for

1913
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,760
the cards and the garage door readers

1914
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,679
are designed to work it like to get away

1915
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:38,719
and then they

1916
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,199
yeah we'll do that in a second

1917
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:42,960
so they can get pretty far

1918
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:43,760
okay

1919
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,280
all right so we're having so much fun

1920
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,840
here but we really do need to go anyway

1921
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:48,960
yeah yes

1922
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,719
all right good job thank you i'll take a

1923
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,040
walk

1924
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,719
all right

1925
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,800
so that took a little bit longer

1926
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,960
than expected yeah you're closest

1927
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,199
yes

1928
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:25,280
i was able to get into the decoding um

1929
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,280
circuit and i found that what it was

1930
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,199
doing is i thought initially it was it

1931
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,960
was just reflecting back on the main

1932
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,719
signal that's not what it's doing it's

1933
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:34,800
looking entirely at the back scatter so

1934
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,640
what you want to actually do

1935
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,480
is we're going to

1936
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,120
stop recording or stop playing back

1937
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,040
we're going to set the

1938
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,120
sample rate to something really low like

1939
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,239
uh

1940
01:21:47,239 --> 01:21:48,800
32k

1941
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,840
yes okay

1942
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,719
there we go we're going to set the uh

1943
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,639
instead it's like nine kilohertz

1944
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,320
i can't see

1945
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,440
all right well that looks excellent

1946
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,839
let's go

1947
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,120
to the center one right here

1948
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,159
there we go

1949
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,639
uh we're gonna set it uh

1950
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:41,040
raw iq uh we're gonna center it

1951
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,360
there we go okay

1952
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,880
and then we will record

1953
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,639
let's see how we record

1954
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,760
ah there it is

1955
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,920
no frequency manager no

1956
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,360
three bars at the top left from the

1957
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,280
option

1958
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,679
okay i think so

1959
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:08,800
yeah it should be a record

1960
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,960
oh yeah

1961
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,040
yeah

1962
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,040
um

1963
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,400
oh anyway so the signal is right there

1964
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,880
uh see how we're going to record this

1965
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,120
there is a way audio

1966
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,560
no we don't want to record the audio we

1967
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,920
want to record

1968
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:28,719
the

1969
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,080
uh iq

1970
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,520
so we have if not live recorder

1971
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,400
mickey recorder

1972
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,600
hd advancement audio recorder

1973
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,000
yeah okay

1974
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,719
no where is it this is this is obnoxious

1975
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:47,719
okay

1976
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:55,399
[Music]

1977
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,040
basement

1978
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,280
sideband you load it up into universal

1979
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,639
radio hacker and you can get the data

1980
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:20,159
off or

1981
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,800
you can do something even simpler

1982
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,679
go to the flipper

1983
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,239
exit

1984
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,159
125 kilohertz rfid

1985
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:35,120
we will then read

1986
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,199
we will read

1987
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,760
we will read

1988
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,199
there we go okay

1989
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:46,480
and it says here that it is you know a

1990
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,880
um a card we can use it to to play back

1991
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,239
the

1992
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:53,759
uh playback what's on here

1993
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:57,719
anyway let's continue

1994
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:08,560
okay and so yeah we got the backscatter

1995
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,679
uh so yeah when you're dealing with

1996
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,440
these low frequency rfid cards you're

1997
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,120
usually going to come up with hidden

1998
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,520
prox cards which is the most common type

1999
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,880
or em4100s which are often found in like

2000
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,400
eastern europe i've never seen them here

2001
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,760
in north america

2002
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,760
but they're just all unencrypted and

2003
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,040
usually it's written all the cards

2004
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,040
remember i said if you see a card and

2005
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,560
has numbers on it

2006
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,040
those numbers can probably be are are

2007
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,400
probably what's being read off the yard

2008
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,320
i gave you guys

2009
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,679
um

2010
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,560
so hip prox cards are really awesome uh

2011
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,360
they have they only store a few bytes

2012
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,360
it's usually the facility code

2013
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:47,040
and the serial needs serial sequence so

2014
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,199
for example my apartment complex

2015
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:51,840
the facility code is always the same

2016
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,159
uh and the sequence number uh goes up by

2017
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:55,760
one for every residence

2018
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,760
so uh when i moved in i just i read the

2019
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,440
i read the rfid from my key fob

2020
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,080
um and then i was locked out of like

2021
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,520
stuff because it was covet if i want to

2022
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,560
check it out

2023
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,320
so i just increased this you know

2024
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,600
decreased the sequence number since i

2025
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,120
was the newest one in

2026
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,360
um and i just you know found one that

2027
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,639
launched like a manager or something and

2028
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:19,600
i just thought it was almost

2029
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,639
yeah was a not

2030
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,069
[Music]

2031
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,880
in the available

2032
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,960
i mean we mean the reader reminds me of

2033
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,800
a pi zero yes

2034
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,360
it's not even a pi zero it is it is

2035
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,800
cheaper than that i can assure you

2036
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,560
uh all right so

2037
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,360
um and yeah so the em

2038
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,080
4100 stores 64

2039
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,320
bits of data that's it

2040
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,320
uh and the problem with that though is

2041
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,400
that there's checksums at the end check

2042
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,120
checkbits crc bits whatever

2043
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,719
uh that makes it difficult to read in

2044
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,280
like a hexagon so

2045
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,880
i don't like those

2046
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,960
um and i sh would be remiss not to

2047
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,920
mention the t577 cards which you can

2048
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,480
write to so if you do see it keep up and

2049
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,239
you're like hey i want to let someone in

2050
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,080
my building you know i can just give i

2051
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,480
can copy the rfid give it to sam you can

2052
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,320
come into my building

2053
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,880
so let's look at blueprint yes

2054
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,760
um and nfc is the same thing except that

2055
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,679
it is of course at a much higher

2056
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:33,199
frequency

2057
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,400
uh so nfc's um nfc communication which

2058
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,159
is another aspect of the flipper zero

2059
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:42,960
uh runs is two ways so what we saw

2060
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,040
earlier was that you put up a low

2061
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,520
frequency rfid tag near the reader and

2062
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,000
just freeze from the low frequency tag

2063
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,600
with rfid you get like a two-way

2064
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,040
communication going which is how you're

2065
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,639
able to do like payment processing and

2066
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:56,080
stuff like that

2067
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,840
um it can store more information and

2068
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,600
when i say more that's a very relative

2069
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,199
term we're talking like some of them

2070
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:04,000
hold like a hundred fights some almost

2071
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,400
500 i mean like sometimes even 900 bites

2072
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,960
i mean we're talking big big time here

2073
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,960
um and of course it operates on the hf

2074
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,840
band

2075
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,480
13.

2076
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,520
megahertz

2077
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,480
uh and most important to us is that it

2078
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,800
sports encryption which is a the bane of

2079
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,320
our existence which i

2080
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,320
i i have to say this is what makes this

2081
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,159
is where the flipper zero sort of fails

2082
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:27,520
is because so many of these things

2083
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,120
support encryption

2084
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,880
uh that the flipper zero just can't

2085
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,239
handle it

2086
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:33,840
um

2087
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,120
and so once again this is what it looks

2088
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,719
like you have a

2089
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:37,880
uh

2090
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,040
13.56 megahertz signal this time

2091
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,440
um but then you read off of the lower

2092
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,679
like 12.712 or 14.48 megahertz

2093
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:49,600
uh coming from the

2094
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,400
uh

2095
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,080
coming from the chip or the keypod or

2096
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,440
whatever you're taking

2097
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,840
your phone

2098
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,280
whatever uh and this is familiar this is

2099
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,040
what's inside a

2100
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,960
uh nfc reader you got a big antenna

2101
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,800
built into the pcb

2102
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,400
single chip solution

2103
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,360
uh same tank circuit you saw before

2104
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,719
it's the exact same thing it's just a

2105
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:11,280
different frequency

2106
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,400
and of course uh nfc key fobs same thing

2107
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,480
uh the wires are slightly thicker

2108
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,000
it's about the only difference still

2109
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,320
have the leads going out and just like i

2110
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,239
said acts like a transistor source the

2111
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,800
two wires and then it sends off

2112
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,360
backscatter

2113
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,679
and let's see does anyone want to see

2114
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,600
what it looks like on

2115
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,880
13

2116
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,760
megahertz let's do that

2117
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:53,840
here

2118
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,679
see reader

2119
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,000
we'll quickly open up

2120
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,159
the

2121
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,880
sdr.net again

2122
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,040
we'll go up to 13.56 megahertz

2123
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,480
play won't crash

2124
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,320
so once again we're going to set this to

2125
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,320
13.

2126
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,080
13.56 meters

2127
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:43,639
six

2128
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,320
megahertz

2129
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,960
center frequency there we go

2130
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,719
uh set this to the airspy hf

2131
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:53,679
right

2132
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:55,840
oh there we go and we should see some

2133
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,639
stuff come on oh there we go

2134
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:04,320
yeah

2135
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,760
that's just the reader so yeah the

2136
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,320
frequency change thank you very much

2137
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:11,360
uh 13

2138
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:15,639
point what was it

2139
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,440
in fact we can actually see the signal

2140
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,880
all the way over here

2141
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,280
but yeah it's pretty loud

2142
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,719
this is this is actually much louder

2143
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:26,800
than the low frequency uh but we also

2144
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,719
read from a much further away

2145
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:31,199
um frequency so if we saw earlier

2146
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:34,839
we're going to read it 12.712

2147
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,280
so i'm going to get out a

2148
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:41,159
little rfid tag

2149
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:57,199
[Music]

2150
01:31:57,199 --> 01:32:00,239
thank you uh not much happens between it

2151
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:02,080
being here and it's not being here uh

2152
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:05,520
but if we go back to 12

2153
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,159
points

2154
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:11,799
right 12.712

2155
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,040
we should see the data from the nfc

2156
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:24,960
why is this true that's not good oh oh

2157
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,840
because it read in the number and it

2158
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,560
redid my um

2159
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,800
so it reads in a number and acts as a

2160
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,719
um keyboard

2161
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:38,440
so let's see this is

2162
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,739
[Music]

2163
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,080
notepad

2164
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:02,480
so we do see a signal there

2165
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,800
we take it away the signal goes away

2166
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,239
there's the signal

2167
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:07,360
and that's that's what we're reading

2168
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,440
when we're reading the nfc

2169
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,920
is that a little bit there

2170
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,440
so it transmits

2171
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,040
extends the power on one frequency and

2172
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,639
then listens to that scatter once again

2173
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:19,679
on a lower or higher frequency

2174
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:21,440
and if you were to record that and put

2175
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,480
that into

2176
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,239
universal radio hacker we could get the

2177
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,559
data

2178
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,920
spent enough time so let's do something

2179
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,320
more fun

2180
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,280
so yeah so there's common nfc formats

2181
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,320
you're going to come across a lot the

2182
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,159
most common is my pair

2183
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:40,159
uh that does support encryption and it's

2184
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:41,840
used a lot in like getting into hotel

2185
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,280
rooms

2186
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,719
and bart yeah

2187
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,360
uh as well as many transit systems uh

2188
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,120
and end tag which is essentially the

2189
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:55,199
nfc version of rfid tags

2190
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:58,719
anyway let's go hack nintendo um

2191
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:01,360
because nintendos of course famously use

2192
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,280
amiibos

2193
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,360
yes so nintendo's have these little like

2194
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,440
toys like things going on

2195
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,520
and they're called amiibos

2196
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,120
and basically what it does is that

2197
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,880
there's these little figurines

2198
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,120
and underneath the figurine is a little

2199
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,639
n-tag

2200
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:19,920
um nfc sticker essentially and it

2201
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,280
contains data

2202
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,800
but it's encrypted like i said that's

2203
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,400
the thing about nfcs uh is that our nfc

2204
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,440
format is that a lot of stuff is

2205
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,000
encrypted however a few years ago some

2206
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,320
hackers much better than me i got into

2207
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,239
the nintendo 3ds

2208
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:36,320
and totally stole the the keys there was

2209
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,920
this right there on like every rom that

2210
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,000
they were sending out that used amiibos

2211
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,040
so now

2212
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,880
uh the keys are out there and we can

2213
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,639
totally just like make any amiibo we

2214
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:48,080
want but unfortunately

2215
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,000
we cannot use the flipper 0. flipper 0

2216
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,159
is not powerful enough for this

2217
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:54,719
so what we're going to use instead

2218
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:57,920
is something called

2219
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,239
the prox mark which many of you may have

2220
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:02,800
seen before

2221
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,840
so this is the prox mark

2222
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:06,880
right here

2223
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,480
and

2224
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,679
all right let's

2225
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,080
pull up

2226
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,639
a vm here so we're gonna close out of

2227
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:16,719
this

2228
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,920
okay thank you very much

2229
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,400
oh and by the way you can see the

2230
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,159
numbers that it wrote i'm gonna write

2231
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,559
the tag

2232
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:37,199
so hopefully when you do a uh security

2233
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,199
system you're not using un

2234
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:42,960
unencrypted uh rfid tags

2235
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,480
all right so we're going to open a

2236
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,520
vmware workstation

2237
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,000
here we go

2238
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,520
we're gonna plug in the press mark

2239
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,599
full screen

2240
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,520
see what's going on

2241
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,760
and so i tested this right before

2242
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,159
i uh

2243
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,000
right before i left to make sure that

2244
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,600
the demographic would not get me on this

2245
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,000
because this one i think is a lot of fun

2246
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,760
so we're going to plug in the prox mark

2247
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,679
and it should connect to

2248
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,480
the virtual machine

2249
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,360
very awesome

2250
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,400
pm3 by the way so what i did beforehand

2251
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:43,280
is i downloaded from github the proxmon3

2252
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,600
software whenever you use the proxmark

2253
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,400
download from github don't use whatever

2254
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,719
nonsense that comes with your distro

2255
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:52,560
and you'll save a lot of time there's a

2256
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,080
lot of stuff that you can only get off

2257
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,000
the github including the amiibo hacking

2258
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,040
stuff so

2259
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,400
we're gonna go into the fox part three

2260
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,639
okay awesome it works

2261
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,600
so we're gonna pick a i have smash bros

2262
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,119
ready to go

2263
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:07,199
so we need a smash brothers amiibo to

2264
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,199
test on uh so i'm gonna go into my

2265
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:11,119
downloads folder

2266
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:14,239
uh amiibo bins by the way

2267
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:15,760
uh and this bin is probably downloaded

2268
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,679
you can see where the

2269
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:20,080
key is that they were using i'm not

2270
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:23,600
going to open it unless we get

2271
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,000
sanctioned by the

2272
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,239
um

2273
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,719
uh by the copyright lords um but if we

2274
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,840
go into super smash

2275
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,199
brothers okay

2276
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:36,719
we can pick a character so i need a

2277
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,920
character that someone likes um

2278
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,080
kaz i know you play what's a good what's

2279
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,320
your favorite smash bros character um

2280
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,119
both

2281
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:46,840
is cloud on there

2282
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:50,159
um fighter cast you

2283
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:52,639
no go with lucina then

2284
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,239
yeah

2285
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:56,719
oh no it's here cloud yeah cloud player

2286
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:57,920
one here it is

2287
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,600
okay we'll go with that

2288
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,480
we're gonna pop that onto the desktop

2289
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,840
i'm going to rename it something a

2290
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,360
little easier for us to work with

2291
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,760
and

2292
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,080
get the desktop

2293
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:25,760
so what we have to do

2294
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:27,360
first is

2295
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,719
change cloud.bin into a format that

2296
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,880
uh the proctomark will like

2297
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,320
uh so if you go into the approximate

2298
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,430
directory um

2299
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:36,800
[Music]

2300
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,199
there's a tools directory and what we're

2301
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:42,840
going to find is the pm3 on me been to

2302
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:45,679
email.pl it's just a

2303
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,040
profile that we're going to use to

2304
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,360
convert the bin file that we downloaded

2305
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,880
uh into an email file so we're going to

2306
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,159
run pm3

2307
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,760
okay need

2308
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,440
then to eml and we're just going to

2309
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:05,199
throw in the name of that bin file

2310
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,880
and we're going to be we're going to

2311
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,239
have the output set to

2312
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,799
desktop

2313
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,480
cloud

2314
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,879
you know

2315
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,880
uh it does not look like a proper file

2316
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:26,320
from it oh that's not good

2317
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:29,920
let's try another bin file

2318
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,840
will go through cena

2319
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:52,000
this one works better

2320
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,440
i can't believe something i randomly

2321
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,880
downloaded off the internet wasn't very

2322
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,040
good

2323
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:08,159
there we go okay so it generated an eml

2324
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:10,719
file it's on the desktop and if you look

2325
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:12,239
at the bottom it gave us the commands to

2326
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:15,040
run oh just writing approximate so

2327
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,760
we are going to

2328
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,280
run hf

2329
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:20,400
myfair

2330
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,400
u i forget what that stands for

2331
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,159
uh e-load

2332
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:26,080
dash f and the file loop that that we

2333
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,400
just created so

2334
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:32,759
copy all this microwave

2335
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,639
ah it's done okay

2336
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:52,560
oh actually that's nothing we need to

2337
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:53,920
type email

2338
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,040
there we go

2339
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,679
now it's done

2340
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:00,639
and

2341
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:04,520
we're just gonna copy this command

2342
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,800
and this is just hitting the uh

2343
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,639
universal uh id

2344
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:16,239
that we're gonna use for emulating

2345
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:17,840
now cass come on up let's get your

2346
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:20,159
lucina

2347
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:21,280
where's my

2348
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,480
uh where's my switch

2349
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,960
[Music]

2350
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,239
on the table

2351
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:30,390
oh there it is thank you

2352
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:33,469
[Music]

2353
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,760
so like i said uh nfcs are encrypted but

2354
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:38,960
if you have the keys anything is

2355
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,280
possible

2356
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:44,639
[Music]

2357
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:48,639
here go into the amiibo section

2358
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:49,520
camera

2359
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:50,320
yeah

2360
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,520
i don't know how this is going to work

2361
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:55,639
is it can only go so far

2362
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:04,560
still loading

2363
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,600
still loading excellent

2364
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,239
you know i thought this would like go

2365
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:13,239
away

2366
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:15,520
i thought as soon as we got away from

2367
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,880
like cds and stuff we wouldn't have to

2368
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,639
deal with loading oh i was so silly

2369
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,840
no um

2370
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,880
all right let's get your amiibo you're

2371
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,040
just gonna hold this

2372
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,840
uh right here

2373
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:40,639
there we go you got your amiibo push

2374
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,920
yeah name name the lucino that we just

2375
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,119
uh

2376
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:47,759
just created

2377
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:56,519
maybe you can show the screen here we go

2378
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,880
uh no we have to hold it to the touch

2379
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,880
okay one more time

2380
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,239
yeah ready one more time

2381
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:10,040
a couple of this

2382
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,400
one more time

2383
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,280
okay

2384
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,880
how it should be still working why is it

2385
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,119
not

2386
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,320
the one

2387
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:51,320
yeah

2388
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,520
okay uh we'll restart this

2389
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,760
more time

2390
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,400
okay one more time

2391
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:11,119
there we go registering uh oh

2392
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:13,199
oh maybe we already got it

2393
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:14,800
because it went earlier maybe if we just

2394
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,520
go to the fighter screen

2395
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,960
all right one more time

2396
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,000
register

2397
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:46,960
he's feeling for some reason

2398
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:57,920
i swear this works

2399
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,839
there we got it

2400
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,760
casino yeah

2401
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,920
okay excellent yeah all right

2402
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,760
we just made our own uh amiibo using

2403
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,840
these

2404
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,920
anyway that's that's the coolest nfc i

2405
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:18,639
can think about it

2406
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:25,759
all right so let's finish this one

2407
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,560
i have a question yes um

2408
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,639
about nfc i've got this flipper card

2409
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,960
here yeah you just scanned it it seems

2410
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,119
to be my favorite i feel like it's

2411
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:39,520
encrypted right it is encrypted

2412
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:41,040
um and

2413
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:42,800
if they did it right

2414
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,679
they

2415
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:45,760
itch i had troubles i looked at i looked

2416
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,040
at the clipper card a long time ago and

2417
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,199
i had trouble getting into it if they

2418
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:51,360
did it right it should be

2419
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,520
uh they should be storing your data on

2420
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,760
the server but there have been times

2421
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,239
when people have given out transit cards

2422
01:45:58,239 --> 01:45:59,679
and you can totally hack those two

2423
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:02,400
pieces uh they'll store the the data on

2424
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,480
the card even if you can't decrypt it

2425
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:05,920
what people will do

2426
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,040
is they'll put up someone else's card to

2427
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:10,880
like read the value off of it let's say

2428
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,639
there's one dollar in your card and like

2429
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:14,960
fifty dollars on another person's card

2430
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,040
they'd read the other person's card

2431
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:20,159
um and then they would say add you know

2432
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:21,920
one dollar and then they would put their

2433
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,920
card to read to write onto it and then

2434
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,760
they would get you know the value that

2435
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,000
was on the other person's card

2436
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,600
yeah interesting can you do that on the

2437
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,119
fast track

2438
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:33,280
uh no

2439
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,880
i haven't checked it out i mean you

2440
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,960
would hope in silicon valley we have

2441
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,639
things you know

2442
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:40,159
uh but we can take a look at that after

2443
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:42,159
the presentation if you want to look at

2444
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:44,080
the approach mark on that yeah uh so

2445
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,199
anyways there's a few other things you

2446
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:46,719
can do on the zipper on the on the

2447
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:50,639
flipper zero but that do not involve um

2448
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:53,760
uh uh radio uh so there's like a bad usb

2449
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,679
so it can act like a keyboard and send

2450
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:56,960
commands

2451
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,960
uh you know pre-supplied commands

2452
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,719
there's gpio pins so you can you know

2453
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:02,400
run leds and stuff

2454
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,960
um there's this is something weird i've

2455
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,400
never seen this before and i don't know

2456
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:08,320
where this has come from but apparently

2457
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:09,760
it's a thing there's a thing called an i

2458
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,520
button and it uses like a one wire

2459
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,679
interface and i've only seen these for

2460
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:16,480
like one wire used for things like

2461
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,800
measuring uh sensors

2462
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,000
off like one wire to like a

2463
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,760
microcontroller and apparently it's used

2464
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,520
for something i don't know what i've

2465
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,600
never seen an eye button before but

2466
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,679
apparently it supports it if anyone has

2467
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:29,280
an eye button something i'd love to see

2468
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,480
it work

2469
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,480
there's a command line interface if you

2470
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,400
plug your flippers arrow into the

2471
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:35,360
computer

2472
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,440
you can open up a com port uh get a

2473
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,440
serial interface going

2474
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,960
um and of course there's bluetooth if

2475
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,400
you want to connect your flip reserve to

2476
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:45,040
a app but the flipper zero as far as i

2477
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,960
know does not actually hack bluetooth

2478
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:51,040
which is kind of a disappointment it

2479
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,480
yeah uh so

2480
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,159
whenever the flipper zero does something

2481
01:47:58,159 --> 01:47:59,440
there's always something that i'll do

2482
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,119
something like better so we solve for

2483
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:02,560
like infrared

2484
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,320
uh you can get those little cheap

2485
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,239
infrared mic uh

2486
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:07,679
dongles you can put onto micro

2487
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,000
controllers to get a really deep dive

2488
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
but you know the flippers zero will do

2489
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:12,719
like

2490
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,480
basic stuff that's cool

2491
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:17,520
uh for seven gigahertz stuff yes yeah we

2492
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,000
it can record signals from like

2493
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,679
you know um

2494
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:22,639
a

2495
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:24,239
doorbell or a

2496
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:26,400
you know a tesla tesla thing but if you

2497
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:27,679
actually like have things like falling

2498
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:29,679
codes or if you're doing more detailed

2499
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:31,119
signal analysis you'll probably want to

2500
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:32,800
use like all right

2501
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,800
sdr but for basic stuff

2502
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,159
yeah it's fine

2503
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:38,719
uh for rfid or nfc

2504
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:41,119
uh just get a proxy mark like forget

2505
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:42,960
about the zipper the flipper get approx

2506
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:43,760
mark

2507
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,280
they're awesome as we saw we got an

2508
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:46,400
amiibo

2509
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:49,760
made our own amiibo um uh but you know

2510
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,520
it combines all those things into one

2511
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:52,880
little package that you can carry in

2512
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,239
your pocket so

2513
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:56,159
yeah good times

2514
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:57,679
anyway there's plenty of stuff to play

2515
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:01,840
around in here so let's keep hacking

2516
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,000
really quick the uh uh

2517
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:13,040
what is called the

2518
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,119
value of three so oh you want to look at

2519
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:17,199
the bad usb yeah come on up here come on

2520
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:20,400
let's let's look at the bad usb

2521
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:22,960
i have a usb cable i'm ready to go

2522
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:24,880
awesome so in case you didn't know the

2523
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,159
uh

2524
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,880
the bad usb module came comes from the

2525
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,000
uh uh

2526
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,400
what is it

2527
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,800
not the rubber ducky from hack five

2528
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,119
so if you already know how you know or

2529
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:39,679
previously if you use um

2530
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:44,239
hack five products like the uh um

2531
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:47,199
or what is it the

2532
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:48,800
very election night robert lucky sorry

2533
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:51,440
yeah i always get confused with those um

2534
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:54,480
yeah you basically can use it so it is

2535
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:57,360
very simple so i'll give it a shot i

2536
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,080
gave i got this presentation what a few

2537
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:03,119
weeks ago at the ctf uh you know but i

2538
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,280
really want to show you guys so a second

2539
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:06,800
here

2540
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,840
so what it does

2541
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,480
is

2542
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:13,679
you can't place that that's all right

2543
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:16,080
is it all ready to go

2544
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,199
okay gotcha

2545
01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:19,600
so uh right now because she's she's

2546
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,480
using vmware we have to tell it where we

2547
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,320
want it to run so we just go to the

2548
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,239
connect to host uh we don't want it to

2549
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:27,920
any virtual machine

2550
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:31,280
uh and then uh all i have to do is run

2551
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,199
and as you know

2552
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:35,600
you can do multiple stock but uh in this

2553
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,360
case we're just gonna run the uh the

2554
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,920
demo version of the windows so

2555
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:41,920
here it is

2556
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,080
it will open a notepad you will start

2557
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,840
creating some stuff

2558
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,920
and then it will start writing off the

2559
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:51,159
other sweeper

2560
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,600
so it's basically pretending to be a

2561
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:55,760
keyboard but you can use it to send in

2562
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,360
any commands he wants

2563
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,199
so in this case open notepad and

2564
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:01,360
jailflipper but you know we can have it

2565
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,440
download i don't know interpreter

2566
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,040
whatever we want yeah

2567
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,679
so i an hour again because you probably

2568
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:08,880
didn't see it

2569
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:11,040
so

2570
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,440
here it's going to open notepad

2571
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:14,880
then it's going to start writing

2572
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:15,920
everything

2573
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,840
and again uh the the scripts are going

2574
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:20,239
to be sorted on the bot at the bottom of

2575
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:21,280
the screen

2576
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,800
um that's where

2577
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,960
you get all the uh the scripts so you

2578
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,520
can just load them in here and you know

2579
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,000
it's actually very useful if you're in

2580
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,760
the itunes industry and just running

2581
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:32,800
scripts

2582
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,880
and you want a place to store it you

2583
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:37,440
know this is probably i'm not saying

2584
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,520
it's a good idea i'm just saying this

2585
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,360
might be useful so

2586
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,040
um

2587
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:44,800
what else

2588
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,719
yeah i think that's it there's also a

2589
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:49,440
demo for mac so

2590
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,040
we showed that before

2591
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:54,480
the mac version and that's it so

2592
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:55,599
with that

2593
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:59,880
kaitlin thank you so much

01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:00,960
the world uh raw uh

2619
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:03,360
anyone from thank you kathleen thank you

2620
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,119
very much

2621
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:08,320
oh they're saying thanks

2622
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,840
oh there's a question great

2623
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,159
presentation what kind of specific

2624
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:13,679
tactics besides keeping a white

2625
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:15,760
community for a new device can be used

2626
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:18,480
to protect windows against bad usb

2627
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:21,840
on windows yes uh so you actually can go

2628
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:24,400
into group policies and prevent those

2629
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,880
types of attacks it is a an obnoxious

2630
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:27,840
process

2631
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,520
but you can't do it

2632
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:31,440
um

2633
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,920
i cannot do that so if you also your

2634
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:36,560
company has that's a group policy or

2635
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,639
settings in your local machine but if

2636
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:41,599
you're in an enterprise uh you know

2637
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:44,719
get an edr solution and then they also

2638
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:46,400
have um

2639
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:49,360
bad or usb

2640
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:52,400
policies there as well um

2641
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:55,839
so what do you do

2642
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,040
potentially or actually will detect what

2643
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,560
type of uh

2644
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:02,719
you know of keyboard it is

2645
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:05,520
uh and then he can go from there also it

2646
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:07,920
works with behavior so depending what is

2647
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:09,360
trying to time

2648
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:11,840
we can go from there i've also seen

2649
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,760
projects that look at

2650
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,560
the frequency of the keys being pressed

2651
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,560
so if the keys are being pressed every

2652
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,159
you know one millisecond or every five

2653
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:23,040
milliseconds it knows it must be a robot

2654
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,199
and then it'll block it um but that's

2655
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:26,639
easy to

2656
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,639
you know get around and do it yeah and

2657
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:30,800
said random place

2658
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,719
have a little piece of information about

2659
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:34,159
the eye button

2660
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:35,760
yes oh please so i want to know all

2661
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:39,360
about this one a little device by guys

2662
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,639
from us

2663
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:43,040
and uh this had a little chip which was

2664
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,760
a java card uh

2665
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:48,719
like you have java smart cards

2666
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:51,719
beautiful

2667
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:02,719
[Music]

2668
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:03,920
one wire

2669
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,719
which is sort of serial but tx and rx

2670
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:08,960
are on the same wire

2671
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,560
like one wire

2672
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,239
because of course there's ground so it's

2673
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,480
like two wires

2674
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:18,850
but uh yeah so you can program

2675
01:55:18,850 --> 01:55:21,909
[Music]

2676
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,679
yeah i've never seen them in a while but

2677
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:28,320
um but the flipper zero was made in

2678
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,719
eastern europe so there's a good chance

2679
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:32,960
that a lot of a lot of the technologies

2680
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:34,480
that it focuses on

2681
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,400
are popular over there

2682
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:37,760
but not over here

2683
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,520
there's only one place i ever see smart

2684
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,360
button in the wild it's still used by

2685
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:43,920
security companies really they'll

2686
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:45,440
randomly stick it up on like the corner

2687
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:46,560
of a building

2688
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,239
and they have if they have a guard who's

2689
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:49,440
uncontrolled they want the guards to

2690
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:51,440
basically touch a thing to it

2691
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:53,119
to mark that they were at this point at

2692
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:54,719
that time and that's basically how they

2693
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:56,239
keep track of where their guards are

2694
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:56,960
going to make sure that they're

2695
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,960
controlled

2696
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,040
and but i

2697
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:02,400
i think security companies use that

2698
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,840
because they've been using it for like

2699
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,159
20 plus years because i've seen i saw 20

2700
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:08,080
years ago and i still see i still see

2701
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:10,080
them stuck in buildings occasionally

2702
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,440
it looks like somebody just randomly

2703
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:12,960
stuck a really large button cell battery

2704
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:15,040
on the side of the building

2705
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:17,360
i've seen in the background

2706
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:18,960
oh cool

2707
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,679
you can find sometimes on ebay uh that's

2708
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:24,320
a very different really collectible it's

2709
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:28,960
a ring like a bigger ring that has an

2710
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:38,719
there was no question about the

2711
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:41,040
airstrike now the airspace so yeah let's

2712
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,520
go to the air spike website

2713
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:45,520
okay

2714
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,040
so there's only like

2715
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:50,239
three modes of rear spine that you can

2716
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:51,840
you can get here so if we go to the air

2717
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:55,239
spy website

2718
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:04,840
i can go to purchase

2719
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:09,560
airspy.us is where i got mine

2720
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:13,360
the demo gods goddess again there's 5.

2721
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:17,119
us appears to be down or very slow

2722
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:19,599
oh there we go okay

2723
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:21,679
so if you go on to their products

2724
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:24,960
uh you'll see that there's some sdi

2725
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,199
receivers

2726
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:29,360
and here we go so there's like the xtr

2727
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,760
mini which is sort of the competitor to

2728
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,679
like the rtl devices

2729
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:37,199
um for 100 the one i have here

2730
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:41,440
the air spy r2 is 170

2731
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:44,000
and then the hf

2732
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,880
this one right here is another 170 but

2733
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:50,400
that one does the lower frequencies

2734
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,400
yeah sdrs can get really expensive when

2735
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:54,960
you start getting into the to the

2736
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,040
you know really good ones so the one

2737
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:58,719
that i really like is called the blade

2738
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:01,040
rf

2739
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,599
and this is this is only if you're like

2740
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:05,360
getting into like signal processing and

2741
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:06,719
making your own

2742
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:08,400
uh rf hardware

2743
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,840
uh but

2744
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,719
uh it goes all the way up to it has two

2745
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:15,119
transmitted antennas to receive antennas

2746
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:17,280
you can turn it into a wi-fi hotspot i

2747
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:20,080
kid you not there's a um

2748
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:22,480
there is a fpga on board and you can

2749
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,280
actually

2750
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:26,080
turn your str into a wi-fi hotspot and

2751
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:28,560
they have the code to do it right here

2752
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,599
um but it is a little expensive so

2753
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:33,440
um

2754
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,119
we go to the shop

2755
01:58:35,119 --> 01:58:38,239
we see that they start at about 540. go

2756
01:58:38,239 --> 01:58:40,239
up to 780 and if you want to blast it

2757
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:42,080
off in the space and get a you need a

2758
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:43,440
thermal version

2759
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:48,000
uh it costs you like 1 600 or more

2760
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,520
but they're awesome i love those later

2761
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:50,880
on

2762
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,199
awesome

2763
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,440
that's that's to give you an idea about

2764
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:56,560
how

2765
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,639
how the air spy

2766
01:58:58,639 --> 01:58:59,840
prices compared to the other

2767
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,960
professional sdr

2768
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:05,679
all right let's see any other

2769
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:06,800
questions

2770
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,400
yeah i said the air supply that we used

2771
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:10,239
was the air supply r2

2772
01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:13,360
uh for the 433 the sub gigahertz and

2773
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:15,360
then the air spy hf

2774
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:19,040
for looking at the rfi visa

2775
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:21,920
is the blader up expensive because of

2776
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:23,360
any hardware that's inside of it or is

2777
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:25,440
it the software and all that

2778
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,760
it's entirely the hardware

2779
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,119
uh like i said if we go back to the

2780
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:32,260
blade rf website

2781
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:35,310
[Music]

2782
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:44,639
there's a lot of

2783
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:46,159
rf engineering that goes on so when

2784
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:48,000
you're designing rf devices it's a

2785
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,840
little bit different than

2786
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,440
dividing then

2787
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,920
designing traditional like analog or

2788
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,440
digital devices because you have to be

2789
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:58,440
very

2790
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,800
particular about what's going what goes

2791
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,800
on in the entire signal path and there's

2792
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,000
a lot of signals

2793
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,520
uh so you have to make sure that there's

2794
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,199
low noise being brought in because you

2795
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:08,400
have a lot of like amplifiers for

2796
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,400
example uh you need to make sure that

2797
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,480
the timing circuits are

2798
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:13,679
you know going to be as precise as

2799
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:15,199
possible so you need something you can't

2800
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:17,280
just have a regular old crystal

2801
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,880
oscillator you need some you at least

2802
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,560
need a temperature controlled

2803
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,000
or temperature compensated crystal

2804
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,840
oscillator and of course you need to

2805
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,599
keep in track of like impedances and

2806
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:26,960
stuff like that

2807
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,000
um but if you look at the

2808
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,280
image right here you'll see that there's

2809
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,679
a giant fpga

2810
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:35,440
right in the

2811
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:38,159
right in the center here like cyclone

2812
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:40,480
and these things are really expensive so

2813
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:42,800
you have a lot of expensive rf hardware

2814
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:45,199
uh shielded of course and you have two

2815
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:46,320
receive

2816
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,880
signal paths two transmit signal pass

2817
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,800
um and also a really expensive

2818
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,480
fpga that you're working with so that's

2819
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,000
that's why it's so expensive i mean it

2820
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,800
really does cost that much but you can

2821
02:00:58,800 --> 02:00:59,679
uh

2822
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:03,599
sdrs are the radio equivalent of fpgas

2823
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:05,119
in the digital world if anyone's ever

2824
02:01:05,119 --> 02:01:07,280
used those and of course this also has

2825
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,280
an fpga so it's like

2826
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:12,159
double as expensive

2827
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:16,320
where would they use these expensive

2828
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:18,239
so if let's say you're doing you're

2829
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:20,960
designing your own rf systems like you

2830
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:22,960
are designing a new product

2831
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:26,080
and you're you want to

2832
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:28,239
like design a new

2833
02:01:28,239 --> 02:01:30,159
wi-fi chip

2834
02:01:30,159 --> 02:01:31,599
uh you would actually get something like

2835
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:32,400
this

2836
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:33,760
and like i said you can actually load up

2837
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:36,719
the fpga with software uh that will turn

2838
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,920
this entire device into a wi-fi router

2839
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:42,159
um that you have full control over um

2840
02:01:42,159 --> 02:01:44,080
you can also turn this into like let's

2841
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:46,000
say you're developing a doorbell

2842
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,639
and you want to run on like 433

2843
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:50,239
you know 19 megahertz and you're just

2844
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:52,400
you're designing the circuitry uh that's

2845
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,440
where this would come in so if you're

2846
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,119
doing rf design

2847
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:57,440
uh instead of building an rf circuit by

2848
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:59,440
hand uh you can use this to sort of

2849
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:03,879
simplify the process and do everything

2850
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,000
what like application they would use to

2851
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,800
develop um

2852
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:18,880
uh like what so

2853
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,920
um so to program the fpga you're gonna

2854
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,560
use something like um

2855
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,320
uh like xilinx or

2856
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:29,280
their software um and then but for radio

2857
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,199
programming you use something like gnu

2858
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:34,639
radio or simulink and matlab

2859
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:36,320
um and then

2860
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,080
you can take those effects and implement

2861
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:39,679
that on a much cheaper solution if

2862
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:42,159
you're going to scale it up oh

2863
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:44,400
commercial application i don't need a

2864
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:47,799
software application

2865
02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:54,400
yeah these are used in development so if

2866
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,239
you are developing a a new piece of

2867
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:58,159
hardware i see

2868
02:02:58,159 --> 02:03:01,159
yeah

2869
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:07,440
this is like way overkill

2870
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,719
i mean it's awesome if you want to use

2871
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:10,239
this but um

2872
02:03:10,239 --> 02:03:11,840
like an air spy would be better for like

2873
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:14,560
a web str um but like i said if you're

2874
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,719
doing anything like rf development

2875
02:03:16,719 --> 02:03:19,920
yeah you gotta use something like this

2876
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:23,119
any other questions

2877
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,040
all right all right thank you

2878
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:29,189
[Applause]

2879
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:32,639
yeah that's it guys so thank you so much

2880
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:34,080
for coming and

2881
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:36,320
yeah we'll we'll see each other for the

2882
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,360
next month and we'll get a

2883
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:41,679
new cool presentation like this and

2884
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:43,520
also make your you know we want some

2885
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:45,920
input from you so again please let us

2886
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:47,360
know what you want to hear what you want

2887
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:49,599
to see yeah and we have friends i'll

2888
02:03:49,599 --> 02:03:53,360
find the speakers just tell me yeah

2889
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:55,598
so
