00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
a quick little thing about me um i have

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,760
certs

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
i teach at cabrillo i run competitions

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
for the bay area for skillsusa

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,040
in california and in florida uh but

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,320
honestly the

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,840
the title that i would go with for

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,759
myself is troublemaker

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,080
because i like to get into trouble cause

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,520
all kinds of mayhem

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,200
because it's a whole lot of fun and it

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
it puts hands-on experience

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,079
for not only for myself but also for the

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,400
students and competitors that i mentor

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,240
and teach

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,439
in zoom if you are using the app

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,079
uh here is a little tip when someone

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,960
keeps

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,560
changing screens like i will throughout

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,840
this under the share screen options

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,240
there is a choice here this is maintain

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,439
current size

47
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,560
that way as i switch from one screen to

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,360
another

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,079
and i reshare again it doesn't take over

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,960
your entire

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
monitor over and over again because i

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,399
know that gets annoying for me

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,639
so here's a little quick pro tip for you

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,160
so today we will spend our time

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
on this page and i will put this

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,959
in the zoom chat

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,839
a very simple page

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,760
but i organize this out so that at any

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,440
anybody at any level

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,760
can participate for example

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,840
if you have if you are starting up

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,959
you have no a knowledge in networking

63
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,400
and html

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,000
and in sql level 0 is for you

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,080
so in level 0 there's there's a very

66
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
quick thing from microsoft on

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,640
how networks function there are two

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,360
links

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,680
that lead to w3 schools on html and css

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,560
and there's a link for sql bolt for the

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
introduction to sql

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,280
now you don't have to be a expert

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,879
in these things you don't have to

74
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,480
understand the

75
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,280
the minutia of how a packet is created

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
and said you don't have to know

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,800
uh you don't have to be able to read

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,280
html you know

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,080
or be like a webmaster forever in a day

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,720
or be

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,200
a sql administrator for 20 years you

82
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,959
just have to be able to read it and

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,720
understand what it says being able to

84
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,920
get the gist

85
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,239
of what is being presented to you that

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,319
will be enough to go from level zero to

87
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,879
level one

88
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,280
we're going to start today from level

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,400
one

90
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
introducing what is oauth's top ten

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,879
then we'll spend some time there i'll

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,120
show you some stuff from level two

93
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,319
uh some of the tools and the challenges

94
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,640
and then we'll i'll also show you level

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,400
three towards the end

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,319
the point of this is you're able to

97
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,080
start wherever you want

98
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
and go off uh as you know if you feel

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,840
you are

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,239
well versed in in this world you could

101
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,920
just start right at level three if you

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,640
feel

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,319
uh like you you know you're getting

104
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,920
started but you understand networking

105
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,239
you understand how html works you have

106
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,840
an understanding of sql you can start

107
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
right at level one

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,000
where we will be today

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:28,080
any questions about how this will work

110
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,320
okay

111
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,199
and off to the site

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,880
we are going to click on introductory

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,880
training modules first

114
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,040
so again uh from this site

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
click on that and that will take you

116
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,759
to this instead of

117
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,280
starting with instead of going with the

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120
list and talking about that let's

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,759
actually

120
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,440
do it so you have some hands-on

121
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,880
into what we're going to be doing

122
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,759
and to start let's go with

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,080
i believe there is a sequel one in here

124
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,800
let's go uh here it goes sql injection

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,720
so for me it was the fourth one

126
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,400
and let me know when you're there either

127
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
by voice or

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,639
in the chat

129
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,520
and just click on sql injection

130
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,960
and you'll be presented with this

131
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,719
so from this page

132
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,960
that i will re-put in the chat

133
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,440
we are clicking on this one in level one

134
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
the introductory training modules

135
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,639
this first link will take you

136
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,840
i'll take one step back

137
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
to this and the one we're going to click

138
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
on

139
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,960
is sql injection

140
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:35,840
i'll just open this in a new tab

141
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,919
so if you are here it is a very simple

142
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,800
process this site tells you what to do

143
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,120
step by step

144
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
so you don't need to install anything

145
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,160
you don't need to run anything extra

146
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,080
just follow along the the process as it

147
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,039
shows you

148
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,080
what a sql injection is

149
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,960
and again we're starting with hands-on

150
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,840
uh

151
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,080
hands-on into the oauth top 10 which

152
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,960
i'll show you next

153
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,120
uh so the first page was a little

154
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,400
introduction

155
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,599
second we have an email

156
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,639
that looks like it arrived to bob we

157
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,199
have a get

158
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,080
discount button and an unsubscribe link

159
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,400
typical emails from companies

160
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
having reviewed the email bob decides to

161
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,080
investigate carbive's

162
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,680
email opt-out functionality

163
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,440
we click on unsubscribe we are taken to

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,039
an unsubscribe page

165
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,240
again you don't have to install anything

166
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,960
we're just following this along

167
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,000
uh clicking the link gives you

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,680
uh this bob decides to test this

169
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,759
functionality by submitting

170
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,360
an email address so you can click on

171
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,039
this copy button

172
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,680
and it'll bounce when it says you copied

173
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,840
and we're going to paste it

174
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,039
inside of this

175
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,720
then we'll hit submit typical

176
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,520
and now we start to see what sql

177
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,400
injection is

178
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,080
to understand the subscribe

179
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,479
functionality

180
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,160
uh bob has to communicate with a

181
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
back-end server again if you have no

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,759
understanding of networking and how this

183
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,280
works that's that's where you need to go

184
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,160
back to level 0.

185
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,759
we have a little note of what is a web

186
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,919
proxy

187
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,120
here we see the entire request that is

188
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,760
going

189
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,880
from this site out we can hit analyze

190
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
request to review it

191
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
and here's some more information upon

192
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,720
the clicking submit

193
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,959
you'll see a post an http post

194
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,880
requesting past email with that

195
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,000
parameter

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
so whatever we entered in is that

197
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,640
parameter

198
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,680
then we can hit next

199
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,839
we have some back end code to look at

200
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
again it's highlighting for us showing

201
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,959
us things of

202
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,080
interest and if uh

203
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,920
you are more than welcome to go ahead of

204
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,720
me if you'd like

205
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,800
so there is a unsubscribed user method

206
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,440
to unsubscribe a user here is a

207
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,080
parameter

208
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,160
and it extracts the

209
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,200
the email parameter via post

210
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,320
here is the actual sql function

211
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,720
created uh by concatenating email

212
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
with sql

213
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,279
we have the execution and the result

214
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,839
if a user was found the variable is

215
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
filled

216
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,680
uh there's a question this code is

217
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,839
in a js file when you expect elements

218
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,160
yes so what this site is doing is

219
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,079
showing you in a very sandboxed way the

220
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,560
things that you'll be doing later

221
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,480
that's why i wanted to start with this

222
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,320
because this is telling you really step

223
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,600
by step in a in a very easy to digest

224
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,320
way

225
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
of what we'll be doing

226
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,599
we have a place to modify our request

227
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,160
it wants us to put bob at live mail

228
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,760
into this little section with the little

229
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,920
unhappy faces so let's post

230
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,199
let's uh paste that there

231
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,600
want to see what happens when we forward

232
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,839
this

233
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,880
here is the response

234
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,959
here's more information there is a extra

235
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,320
apostrophe character resulting in a

236
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,720
error

237
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,519
the ability to inject a user-supplied

238
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,279
input which is interpreted

239
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,760
by the sql engine is known as sql

240
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
injection

241
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,839
so as you continue you will exploit and

242
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,240
again

243
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,200
just by copy pasting you'll exploit this

244
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,399
site

245
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,839
use uh in the manner of sql injection so

246
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,000
the reason why i wanted to show you that

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,639
at least that first half of hands-on is

248
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,240
here is the list of the top 10

249
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,560
vulnerabilities to web applications

250
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,000
this list has not changed since 2017

251
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,839
even the list for the majority has

252
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,600
pretty much stayed the same

253
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,360
here is the list at the top the biggest

254
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,160
risk

255
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,639
is injection the one that you're doing

256
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,480
right now

257
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,240
that is the number one flaw that exists

258
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,760
the number two is broken authentication

259
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,639
being able to utilize session management

260
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,279
and

261
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,440
be able to compromise passwords keys and

262
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,040
other stuff

263
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,720
number three sensitive data exposure

264
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
since many applications don't properly

265
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,639
protect sensitive data

266
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,079
it can get out and so on and so forth we

267
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,760
have xml

268
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,480
external entities broken access control

269
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
security misconfiguration

270
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,760
cross-site scripting insecure

271
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,480
deserialization

272
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,079
using components with known

273
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,760
vulnerabilities and insufficient logging

274
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,279
these are the top 10 risks

275
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,639
on a site so what i'd like you to do

276
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,920
for the next couple of minutes is

277
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,839
continue

278
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,800
going through this

279
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,720
this quick little activity

280
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,639
and then pick a second one from this

281
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,639
list

282
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,680
these are all examples

283
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,360
of these and rather than reading them

284
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,440
all out let's do them

285
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,560
if you have any questions please feel

286
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
free to ask away in the chat

287
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
there are awesome people here who can

288
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,399
help you

289
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,560
but this site is pretty straightforward

290
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,240
in telling you

291
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:02,560
and guiding you what to do at every step

292
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,320
and for now i'll pause the recording

293
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,720
resume

294
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,360
okay i will show you some stuff from

295
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
level two

296
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,000
feel free to stay working on this site

297
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,760
especially if you are completely new to

298
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,480
the world of web application

299
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,519
exploitation you more than welcome to

300
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,680
continue working on this site trying the

301
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,720
different

302
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,839
uh little little trainings out don't

303
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,279
feel

304
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,560
sounds like i got feedback

305
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
um okay um

306
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,680
don't feel that you have to follow along

307
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,160
uh just i'm gonna show you what what the

308
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,920
next steps are that way when you do

309
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
complete this site and you're ready to

310
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,240
move on

311
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,160
you'll have an idea of what to do next

312
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,800
so moving on into level two

313
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,399
you will need burp suite

314
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,160
burp suite is one of those uh big tools

315
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,079
that are used by industry to do this

316
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,600
kind of stuff

317
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
burp suite is free the link that i have

318
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
provided for you

319
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
is the community edition this is great

320
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,920
for learning you do not have to buy it

321
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,800
you especially at this point where

322
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,920
you're learning how this all works

323
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,720
you know the community edition is just

324
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,519
is just right

325
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,519
so let me make a new share

326
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,600
and switch over to here

327
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,480
i have installed it on my windows vm

328
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,000
it was a piece of cake just went to

329
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,839
download the latest version

330
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,639
clicked on the green download button and

331
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,079
it downloaded

332
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,680
a 180 megabyte file i believe

333
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,079
installation is just like any other

334
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,719
application

335
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,600
uh when it's fully installed you'll have

336
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,880
this

337
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
new folder and purposely community

338
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,199
edition

339
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
when you run it the first time of course

340
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,160
it'll ask you do you accept the terms

341
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
because we are learning we're going to

342
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,160
accept the default settings

343
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,759
so things like the temporary project

344
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,120
using the verb defaults

345
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,639
which is all there really is to it when

346
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,720
you start it

347
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,279
and you have the tool up and ready to go

348
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,680
for the later stuff that we'll be doing

349
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,399
in in this uh in these levels

350
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,279
so just wanted to quickly show you uh

351
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,040
one of the big tools

352
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,399
that are used for this

353
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,920
um i haven't tested burp suite running

354
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,839
on a

355
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,559
m1 this is actually a cloud vm

356
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:18,000
that i have running on on google

357
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,079
so having burp installed on a vm or

358
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
locally however you wish

359
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,880
will definitely be a useful tool

360
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
in doing a web application exploitation

361
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,640
a site that i will point to

362
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,280
as you can see quite a number of times

363
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,360
is try hackme

364
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,720
they have many rooms that you can use

365
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,160
to learn the the stuff that we're doing

366
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,919
from the first site in another form

367
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,679
so you'll still keep learning things

368
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,360
like command injection and sequel

369
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,480
injection

370
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,559
uh just in different hands-on ways

371
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,480
so for example i'll open up the oauth

372
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,120
top 10.

373
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,880
for this you will need an account

374
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,360
and you can use a free account if you

375
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
wish

376
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,480
i i'm actually paying for it because i i

377
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,360
believe in the value of it and it gives

378
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
you access to more stuff within

379
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,760
uh try hack me so i've reset my account

380
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,160
uh just to show you how this will work

381
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
once you make an account and you log in

382
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,559
and you can go straight to that link

383
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,399
which again is provided from my site

384
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,400
it's it's uh capture the flag

385
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,200
mode so you'll have tasks to do

386
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,760
with questions within them that you'll

387
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,160
answer

388
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,960
and as you do you'll progress through

389
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,480
the room and whatever and whatever

390
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,919
various things you need to do so there's

391
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,360
a question about

392
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,480
uh can i explain command injection well

393
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,679
right here

394
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,160
in this try hack me room the first task

395
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,600
that you'll need to do

396
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,400
is that and command injection is really

397
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,440
getting

398
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,520
a command line uh to get executed

399
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,400
on your behalf so for example one of the

400
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,840
typical things

401
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
that a attacker first does to confirm

402
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
that they are in the system

403
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,960
is run the command who am i to see

404
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,840
am have i fully connected to my target

405
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,640
system

406
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,720
do i have terminal access or do i have

407
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,000
command line action

408
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,840
to be able to do anything that i want

409
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,240
so uh in task five is when you'll

410
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,919
actually start using

411
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,080
the the machine that's built for this

412
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,600
room and there's a little start machine

413
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,120
button

414
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,600
uh you'll hit it'll start up a virtual

415
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
machine on their network

416
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,640
and i'll show you how to connect in a

417
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,720
moment so

418
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
uh just like everything else here's

419
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
here's some stuff to read through

420
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
and then there are some questions to

421
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,840
answer

422
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,720
and as you answer sometimes it will give

423
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,039
you some hints

424
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,320
so don't feel like you have to be able

425
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,840
to solve it on your own

426
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,120
we are all learning it is perfectly fine

427
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,679
to look at hints if you get stuck and

428
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,280
since we are doing this together feel

429
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,880
free to also ask questions in the chat

430
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
so i'm going to give you a couple

431
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,080
minutes if you are

432
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,880
following along with me to create a try

433
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,679
hack me account if you haven't already

434
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,400
and then jump into this room the owas

435
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,159
top 10 room

436
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
and when you're ready then then i'll

437
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,600
continue

438
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,559
but again if this is if you are still

439
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,600
working

440
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,120
in the in the first r in the first link

441
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,600
the introductory training modules from

442
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,280
application.security please continue to

443
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,960
work there

444
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,880
don't feel that you have to move forward

445
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,960
okay so in order to connect to a try

446
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
hackme room

447
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,000
uh there is

448
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,919
a simple way that you can get to it

449
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,280
and i'll make it in a new tab

450
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,159
the link for this is this one

451
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,960
in italics connected try hackney's vpn

452
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,919
they have everything behind a vpn which

453
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,000
is great

454
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,760
so you have two options

455
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,960
to connect into the network you can do

456
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,080
it yourself

457
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,200
with openvpn which is free

458
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,520
or if you pay the ten dollars a month

459
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,919
you can get your own kali linux machine

460
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,039
in the browser again it's

461
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,919
completely up to you getting started

462
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,840
connecting through openvpn

463
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,280
is perfectly fine from

464
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,000
your machine whether that is the machine

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,799
in front of you or a virtual machine

466
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,520
you will download the configuration file

467
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,760
this file is the one you'll need to open

468
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,720
within

469
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,799
the openvpn program in order to connect

470
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,600
into their network because you can't get

471
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,400
to

472
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,490
all the rooms from the outside

473
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,159
[Music]

474
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,960
if you decide that uh try hackney is

475
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,440
great

476
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,840
and you want to pay the the monthly fee

477
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,120
of 10

478
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,919
then you'll be able to access a cali

479
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,200
linux image

480
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,520
right from the browser without having to

481
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,400
create any vpn connection

482
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,679
now that again the choice is yours both

483
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,760
are pretty easy to use

484
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,919
again if you're going to use this method

485
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,240
you'll need to install openvpn

486
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,200
and they have instructions for you so

487
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,559
let's say you are on windows

488
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,320
you'll download your configuration pack

489
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
and that there's a link for that

490
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
you'll install the gui application and

491
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,000
they have step by step

492
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,880
what to do after you install how to

493
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
import the file

494
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,600
and connect if you are on a mac

495
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,440
again they have instructions step by

496
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,640
step

497
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,440
of what to do

498
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,360
once you have done that you'll be able

499
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
to see you have completely connected

500
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,200
because this will change

501
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,080
from a red x to the check mark to say

502
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,039
you are connected

503
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,840
i'll show you what this looks like

504
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,720
say i want kali linux

505
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,840
start machine

506
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,840
as you can see it's only up for a small

507
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,559
period of time

508
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
along with username and password

509
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
but that's fine that it'll go away after

510
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,720
a bit

511
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,320
in order to access the rooms while we

512
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,760
wait for my

513
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,400
vm to get started we first need to click

514
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,600
on this join room button

515
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,840
that way we can start submitting answers

516
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,760
by joining the room we've already

517
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,919
answered a few of these as you can see

518
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:00,960
no answer needed

519
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,440
completed

520
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,640
no answer needed awesome we can jump all

521
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,760
the way up

522
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,840
to five

523
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,520
so task 5 is actually command injection

524
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,000
practice

525
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,159
um so again running commands

526
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,480
is doing what you would normally do in a

527
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,360
terminal

528
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,039
but using uh using

529
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,080
the website to make the machine behind

530
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,880
it who's serving the the page run

531
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,080
commands

532
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,360
like who am i id uh

533
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,320
and these

534
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,559
so to complete the question below you'll

535
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,000
need to navigate

536
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,039
to a certain machine

537
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,039
and you'll need to do that either again

538
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,640
through your

539
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,919
ovpn connection or through something

540
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,039
like this

541
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,480
since it is all internal

542
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,600
so we'll need to navigate to the ip

543
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,799
address and right now we don't know what

544
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,600
the ip address is

545
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,919
because i haven't hit start machine so

546
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,360
i'm going to click on start machine

547
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,679
and in a moment well in a minute we will

548
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,720
see what the ip address is for my system

549
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,480
for yours it could be a little different

550
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,520
yeah yeah i could you can hear me right

551
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,039
yes

552
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,600
so i will hit pause recording well you

553
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,158
guys hear me

554
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,400
once you are able to see your private ip

555
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,039
address here's the one for mine

556
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,279
you can now begin to answer these

557
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,760
questions

558
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,120
so to complete the questions below in

559
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,679
either the machine you have installed

560
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,600
openvpn on

561
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,240
or if you have a cali linux box like

562
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,320
this one

563
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,559
you'll need to go to that site

564
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,240
so we need a browser

565
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,840
and this is pretty small

566
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,030
holy moly that's huge

567
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,100
[Laughter]

568
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,840
oh look at that it resizes cool

569
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,799
all right it has been a minute since

570
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,919
i've been

571
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,580
on cali i tend to just use

572
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,679
[Music]

573
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,199
debian oh there's firefox

574
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,679
take a minute to open up cool so

575
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,039
from here we can navigate

576
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,440
in my case i'm going to go to

577
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,200
10.10.59.218

578
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,520
slash evil shell.php

579
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:45,840
your ip address may be different

580
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,360
so we have our first question

581
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,399
what strange text is in the website

582
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,120
root directory oh could you please show

583
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,799
again how to go there no problem

584
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,279
um so number one you need to have the

585
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,039
account

586
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,039
uh once you're in you'll need to

587
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,399
connect to the chai hackney network

588
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,279
if you haven't done so already you could

589
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,559
either pay the 10

590
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,600
a month and get a a

591
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,960
vm within or connect through

592
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,240
vpn once you have that done you have

593
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,200
connected

594
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,320
into their network you're ready to go

595
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,760
go to task 5 within

596
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,640
the oauth top 10 room and then click on

597
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,600
the green

598
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,960
start machine button it'll take about a

599
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,919
minute

600
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,840
but once it's done you'll be presented

601
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,120
with the ip address

602
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,760
of the system for you to work on

603
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,880
then if you scroll down to the bottom of

604
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,159
task 5

605
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,720
you'll see this to complete the

606
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,520
questions below

607
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,799
navigate to whatever i p address is for

608
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,840
your system

609
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,960
so you do that within the the machine

610
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,360
that

611
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,640
is vpn into their network or

612
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,000
like you see me uh within their own

613
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,480
kali system we now have everything we

614
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,200
need

615
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,559
to begin answering these questions

616
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,480
so the first question here is what

617
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,640
strange text file

618
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,320
is in the website root directory

619
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,279
and you have these list of examples

620
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,000
things to try

621
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,520
so try it out put a command in

622
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,320
any one of those or any others that you

623
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,080
think of and let's see what happens so

624
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,880
if i

625
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,679
do who am i let's see what it does

626
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,080
it tells us we are www data

627
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,279
okay how about id

628
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,320
gives us the id of the user

629
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
ifconfig

630
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,720
so these are things that you normally

631
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,399
get when you

632
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,640
type in it type it in like the command

633
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,720
prompt or in terminal

634
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,960
but we're getting it on a website this

635
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,840
is all bad

636
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,559
so how do you view what is

637
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,480
how do you view the files that exist

638
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
when you're using the command line how

639
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
do you

640
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,840
uh view the contents of a folder

641
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,880
right you can do ls so we could do ls

642
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,519
what happens

643
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,640
oh look at that

644
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:11,919
drpepper.txt

645
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,880
seems like that could be the answer

646
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,720
so let's find out that it's a ctf

647
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,360
we are learning trial and error is

648
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,519
totally the way to go

649
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,720
and we hit submit and that is the

650
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,600
correct answer

651
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,279
should i access my ip in the openvpn

652
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,720
via firefox you should be able to yes

653
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,640
once you've connected to their their

654
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,000
network

655
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,080
you will have an ip address to connect

656
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
to

657
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,080
so here's a second question how many

658
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,600
root or non-root non-service non-daemon

659
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,480
users are there

660
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,840
this is looks like a linux question

661
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,840
took me a while well it took sam down a

662
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,320
while

663
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,679
oh uh lisa you put in

664
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,279
the text as is what you need to do

665
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,120
is click on this green start machine

666
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,640
button

667
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,559
and in about a minute your vm will be

668
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,960
ready and you'll be presented with an ip

669
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,159
address

670
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,000
so you'll need to change where it says

671
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,480
my machine underscore ip

672
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,639
with the ip address of the machine

673
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,679
they're presenting to you

674
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,839
then it will be able to connect

675
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,079
yes yeah it did automatically change for

676
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,359
me

677
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,000
so you might not have started up the

678
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,800
room just yet

679
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,079
not a problem at all so we were

680
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,960
able to answer this first question uh

681
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,280
try

682
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,879
answering these others and for now i

683
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,719
will pause the recording

684
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,918
so within level two i have given you

685
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,960
a couple of try hackney rooms for you to

686
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,280
try

687
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,440
so besides that one there is another

688
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,119
tool called the owasp

689
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,240
zap it is similar to

690
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,119
burp suite uh because you know not one

691
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,960
tool can do it all

692
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,560
so uh feel free to try this room out

693
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,760
on your time

694
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,720
and there's also something that tri

695
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,599
hackme

696
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,920
started implementing late last year and

697
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,880
and

698
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,640
has done now is

699
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,760
they have pathways

700
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,320
set up so if you want to get

701
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,240
more knowledge in a structured way

702
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,920
following the try hackme

703
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,119
setup you could do these rooms

704
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,720
in an order and here's some need to know

705
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,079
so if for example

706
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,760
you have no knowledge of linux you can

707
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,160
jump to that track if

708
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,599
after doing this you feel like you want

709
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,200
to continue you could go into

710
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,480
cryptography

711
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,640
they have many modules many learning

712
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,240
pathways that you can use

713
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,359
and they already have a pathway listed

714
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,240
for you

715
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,320
for web packing stuff for the stuff that

716
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,839
we've been talking about today

717
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,480
now your the the last level the further

718
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,320
learning

719
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,480
starts with the web security academy

720
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,880
i've reset this uh this is another free

721
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,160
site that you can use

722
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,520
they also cover the oauth top 10

723
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,720
but in a whole nother way so with these

724
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,920
guys

725
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,359
you have examples of what for example

726
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,920
what sequel injection is

727
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,960
of how do you retrieve data here's

728
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,880
here's some examples and then they have

729
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,119
labs

730
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,240
labs that you can click on

731
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,079
and go to this is where burp suite comes

732
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:08,640
in

733
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,118
to play

734
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,680
so right now it is loading a lab

735
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,640
and in a moment we'll be presented with

736
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,079
a website that that you can deploy

737
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,520
that this kind of attack

738
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,800
that it's talking about in this case in

739
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,200
this

740
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,200
first lab i'll make a

741
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,000
duplicate of this to show you the thing

742
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,560
to do in this first lab

743
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,599
is when the user selects a category the

744
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,880
application carries out

745
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,040
a query in the form of this to solve the

746
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
lab perform a sql injection attack that

747
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,240
causes the application

748
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,200
oops to display details of all products

749
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,960
in any category

750
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,680
so this might sound a lot and that's

751
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,000
okay that's why i put it in level three

752
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
so as you complete the other try hacking

753
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,079
rooms you'll gain an understanding to be

754
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,839
able to handle this

755
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,160
and just like with everything else if

756
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,000
you get stuck if you get lost

757
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,760
it's totally fine to just click on the

758
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,119
solution

759
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,560
and see how you're supposed to answer

760
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,040
this for a lot of these you'll need to

761
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
use burp suite

762
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,160
let me switch over to

763
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,160
my rdp

764
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,720
within burp suite uh inside of proxy

765
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,839
there is a embedded browser already

766
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,000
that you can use to connect to things

767
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,240
like the web security academy

768
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,880
and be able to see what's happening and

769
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,839
intercept

770
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,800
uh so for example

771
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,280
let's see if i can pull up that first

772
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,440
learning path

773
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,720
your sql injection

774
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,160
there's the text about it here's the lab

775
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,598
i might need to log in

776
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,160
no okay um

777
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,319
let's see if it lets me

778
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,040
so you see burp is intercepting

779
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,200
the communication of this browser and in

780
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,119
order for me to forward

781
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,880
either by item i need to click on

782
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,800
forward and then something will happen

783
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,280
over here

784
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,440
so you can see everything that's coming

785
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,359
in and out of the browser

786
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,240
so that you can manipulate it as needed

787
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,440
in order to get what you want

788
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,320
in the case of this very first

789
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,160
lab

790
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,920
according to the burp suite site

791
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,319
we need to use burp to intercept and

792
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,119
modify

793
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,680
the request that sets the product

794
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,520
category filter

795
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
you'll need to modify the category

796
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,760
parameter giving it the value

797
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,880
of the apostrophe plus

798
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,960
or one equals one dash dash

799
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,720
we'll submit the request and verify the

800
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,720
response now contains additional items

801
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,799
so within this text

802
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,280
that we forward as this thing

803
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,560
as this browser talks with

804
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,800
at the web security academy we're going

805
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,640
to get a response

806
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,040
a we're going to see sql in here

807
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,280
and we'll need to modify it in the way

808
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,839
that it was telling us earlier

809
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,319
and that will get us the answer so at

810
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,599
some point

811
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,560
we'll see some uh some sql and then you

812
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,079
can change it

813
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,359
here and then move it forward so that

814
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,839
the uh the sql injection works

815
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,280
now as i said this this is definitely

816
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,040
more higher level because it's not

817
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,480
as it's not as guided as uh

818
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,160
try hackney and the and the um

819
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,960
application.security but it's a great

820
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,319
next step

821
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,480
as you go from understanding the

822
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,920
fundamentals

823
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,240
trying this stuff out in a sandbox

824
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,079
environment to working it and try hack

825
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,119
me and then

826
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,920
using it here in the web security

827
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,440
academy

828
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,359
they have a lot of great in-depth

829
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,839
material that you can use to continue

830
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,440
furthering your knowledge

831
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,839
in web security

832
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,119
so i again i suggest

833
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,880
using that as the next step once

834
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,520
you have accomplished some of the other

835
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,359
hackney rooms the last thing

836
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,760
that i want to show you are these

837
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,319
challenges

838
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,760
the jew shop is one of

839
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,400
the the best ways to implement the stuff

840
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,839
you've been learning in these various

841
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:18,960
rooms

842
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,000
in a ctf format

843
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,440
so you can spin up your own juice shop

844
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,640
there should be a button here to launch

845
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,040
it on heroku i believe

846
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,000
is an online demo

847
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,079
and that will launch the juice shop

848
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,040
you can get some a tutorial on how to

849
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,880
get started in this and it'll tell you

850
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,560
what to do step by step

851
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,800
this application is riddled with

852
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,040
security vulnerabilities

853
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,720
and there is a scoreboard that you need

854
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,079
to find

855
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,560
to begin with and then there's all times

856
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,240
all kinds of vulnerabilities everything

857
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,280
that you'll see

858
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,040
in all the try hackney rooms everything

859
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,319
that you see

860
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,319
and everything prior comes to play here

861
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,000
if you get stuck because as you see

862
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,720
there's not much guidance once you are

863
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,000
at it there is a book a companion guide

864
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
that if you get stuck you can reference

865
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,680
to proceed through the challenges

866
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,359
which is good because this thing has a

867
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,599
lot of challenges and some are easy and

868
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,440
some are really complicated

869
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,680
so it is it is good to have a guide if

870
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,319
you get stuck

871
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,200
further on there's also hackazon and web

872
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,839
goat

873
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,720
two vms that you could run locally

874
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,800
in order to continue testing your

875
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,000
knowledge and

876
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,520
you know testing your skills

877
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,079
that you have gained from everything

878
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,119
else that we've covered

879
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,079
and that's just a quick overview and an

880
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,520
introduction

881
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,359
into webs into web application

882
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,119
exploitation from the ground

883
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,440
up to where you could start doing this

884
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,160
in

885
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,640
contests and even doing this on actual

886
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,040
sites

887
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,880
which you know if you're going to do it

888
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,200
on an actual site be sure that you have

889
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,960
proper approval be sure that you have

890
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
all the proper documentation

891
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,440
i suggest if you're going to do this for

892
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,079
real do it on your own sites first

893
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,680
to gain an understanding to build

894
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,520
documentation to build

895
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,359
a ethical reputation of what you're

896
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,839
doing

897
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,079
definitely uh i would like if if you

898
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,640
have your own web server put up

899
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,640
things like hack is on try it out write

900
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,000
your own write-up

901
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,200
of how you did it just because it's been

902
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,800
done before doesn't mean that you

903
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,640
shouldn't go through it yourself

904
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,760
so definitely try it out yourself

905
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,040
write about it get yourself get yourself

906
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,079
into it hands-on work as you see

907
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,760
through all this and this is just the

908
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
start for you from here you could

909
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,240
definitely go anywhere

910
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,839
in going deeper into web security

911
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,960
i see questions being answered in the

912
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,359
chat

913
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,599
yes burp is like man in the middle it's

914
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,880
more uh man in the browser

915
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,359
um i am using google cloud for my

916
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:47,359
windows vm

917
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,480
that way it doesn't matter doesn't

918
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,319
matter what i'm running locally

919
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,319
it's completely agnostic i could be on a

920
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,880
chromebook i could be on a surface

921
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,839
pro doesn't matter i can still access

922
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:15,839
the machines just the same

923
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,119
um are there any any pressing questions

924
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:29,839
before i stop the recording

925
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,839
uh i'm on task five

926
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,680
how big how many employees do chi

927
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,000
hackney have i'm not sure

928
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,079
but then being around since 2018

929
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,280
definitely

930
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,839
is uh still a new product

931
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,520
but it's a bit for what it is it's a

932
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,880
great learning

933
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,839
uh learning platform

934
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,440
not able to find non-root users by

935
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,160
entering cat

936
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,960
etsy password

937
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,280
see do i still have that room up

938
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,720
i might be able to get it

939
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,640
i recommend it if you want to get

940
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,000
serious

941
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,040
into learning these kinds of things

942
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:53,839
i would i would recommend it

943
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,359
you know that's why the site is called

944
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:49,839
try hack me so you try it

945
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,119
we have a little over 10 minutes left

946
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,800
it worked awesome

947
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,200
rod do you want me to continue the

948
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,319
recording for

949
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:17,440
10 minutes yeah we can leave it for four

950
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,800
nine or 10 minutes yeah

951
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:31,839
no problem

952
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,839
so

953
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,520
with the popularity of the cloud do you

954
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,040
see olaf's top 10

955
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,240
changing drastically um what do you

956
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,720
think

957
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,960
rod do you think the the top 10 will

958
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,960
change

959
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,040
um certain things have changed i noticed

960
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,599
that

961
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,880
um they took uh

962
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,319
i think it was cross side request

963
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,240
forgery um

964
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,760
which used to be in the top ten um

965
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,079
but i agree with you that at the end of

966
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:48,800
the day

967
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,680
and even when i do my assessments

968
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,520
injection is the way to go

969
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,920
if you can get an injection and you can

970
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,440
retrieve data that's a

971
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,520
that's a win right there and um

972
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,440
nowadays you have this uh sort of a

973
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,319
frameworks that are based on javascript

974
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:08,960
and

975
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,470
and depend on on

976
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,359
[Music]

977
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:17,520
dependent backends uh

978
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,760
basically uh server side and sqli for me

979
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,480
are

980
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,839
like the biggest things right now

981
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,280
yeah i think there might be some changes

982
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,319
here and there but

983
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,119
uh like rod said the i think the the top

984
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,160
of the top 10

985
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,240
is probably going to stay like that for

986
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:51,839
a while

987
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,599
yep as long as they make the same

988
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,000
mistakes over and over the top ten

989
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:33,839
will pretty much stay the same

990
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,559
oh thank you how long this lab will work

991
00:52:58,559 --> 00:52:59,040
for us

992
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,680
after your session well all of these

993
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,040
sites like try hack me

994
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,880
web security academy and all that you

995
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,359
can make accounts on your own

996
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,400
so i should be up forever today

997

available for you as well i'm not going

999
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,599
