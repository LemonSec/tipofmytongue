1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,920
and then all of a sudden they're like

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,520
hey we need you to

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,759
you know maybe i can't go into details

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,520
maybe hack some satellites

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,120
so uh you know i have to learn this

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,719
stuff myself and i'm

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,160
one of those people who believes that

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
you i remember about 10

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,599
of what you're taught and about ninety

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,000
percent of what you teach um

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,880
so once again uh i'm going to stop this

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,199
year

13
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,800
go over to the um

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,760
go over to my browser

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,560
and we have a ctf for everyone here to

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,960
do

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,840
uh while i'm giving a presentation uh

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,320
you can

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
and by the way don't feel like it's rude

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,600
to ignore me if there's something you

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
already know just ignore me

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
and focus on the ctf so we have some

23
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,960
challenges for you to do

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,559
uh on sam class dot info

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,200
forward slash space and the way you do

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
this is you

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
click on a exercise like sp 100

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,520
and at the end there's a flag and you

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,199
find the flag

30
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,520
and then you would click on submit flags

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,399
make sure you're on

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,680
sp select the challenge 100.1

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,439
add your name so in this case it would

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,280
be i don't know it could be any name

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,080
like

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,960
hacker 100. and then you would add the

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,439
flag

38
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,000
so you'd say

39
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,080
it's definitely not a typo i want uh

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,119
push submit

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,360
and it says oh answering correct so but

42
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,640
if you got it correct you would then go

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,000
on to the scoreboard

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,600
anyway back to the presentation

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,520
stops here and

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,360
uh all right so part one getting into

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,280
space if you wish to make an apple pie

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,400
from scratch

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,399
first you must hack the universe so

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,520
let's talk about how we actually get

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,720
into space

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,560
uh they say don't put equations into

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,159
presentations but this one is so

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,040
important

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
and so critical uh this is called the

56
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,040
rocket equation

57
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,399
uh basically what this means is that

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,399
your quote unquote delta v

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,840
this is a very important term in

60
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,040
rocketry is equal to

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,640
your initial mass the uh over your

62
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,960
final mass so basically what you want to

63
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,000
do is you want

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
to your total amount of of basically

65
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
what this means is that your total

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,959
amount

67
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,760
of change in velocity uh has to do with

68
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,720
how efficient your residents are uh how

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,560
much your initial mass is and how much

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
your final mass is once you've

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
used up all your all your fuel and i see

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,319
we have something in the chat

73
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,920
um i see secret squirrels in this

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,480
uh what secret squirrels in the side

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,959
thumbnails

76
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
oh oh i see oh that's mine that's fine

77
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,800
that's fine good idea

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
so someone says that i'm exposing

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,800
critical information in the thumbnails

80
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,840
that's fine

81
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,760
um uh anyway so

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
uh important rock tree terms so we

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,280
already talked about delta v that means

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,480
change in velocity we're we also have to

85
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,159
talk about specific impulse

86
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,920
which just means engine efficiency

87
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
something with a high

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
specific impulse uh uses very little

89
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,319
fuel to get a lot of delta v

90
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,879
something with very low specific info

91
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,760
impulse

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
or very low engine efficiency uses a lot

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,200
of fuel and doesn't get much delta v

94
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,319
twr stands for thrust to weight ratio

95
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,959
so sometimes we put rockets in space for

96
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,879
spacecraft in space

97
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,840
and they use something like an ion drive

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
and but why don't we use an i because it

99
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,120
has a high specific impulse

100
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
right so it uses very little fuel but

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,319
gets a lot of delta v

102
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,280
but unfortunately the thrust it it

103
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
produces is so low you can't get off the

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,080
ground

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
so that's where thrust to weight ratio

106
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,280
comes in sometimes you just need a lot

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,599
of

108
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,040
thrust uh you know to counteract gravity

109
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,799
but once you're in space

110
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,200
it's not an issue and then because of

111
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
this because we have

112
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,560
you know your initial mass and your

113
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
final mass um

114
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,840
the the way that we do sort of rocky

115
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
configuration is we have it in stages

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,519
so you start off with like the big

117
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,200
rocket you know you think like the

118
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,920
saturn v

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,319
with the big rocket you know it goes up

120
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,400
and it has all this fuel and on top it

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
carries a smaller rocket and it's like a

122
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,439
nesting doll and you have a smaller

123
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,720
rocket on top of that

124
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,040
so the initial mass is smaller and then

125
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,478
the final mass is even smaller and you

126
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,918
just kind of jettison the parts of the

127
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,519
rocket that aren't necessary anymore

128
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,120
and that's called staging um and so once

129
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
you get into orbit

130
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
uh you basically orbit in an ellipse

131
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,320
right i'm sure you've heard about this

132
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,960
before

133
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,320
and maybe you've heard the terms like

134
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
apogee and perigee

135
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,759
and what those means is that part of

136
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,360
your orbit is going to be closer

137
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,400
to the main

138
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
main orbital body so in this case the

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,040
ear so like let's say we're talking

140
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,080
about the earth

141
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
so when you are close to the earth in

142
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
your orbit that's called the

143
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,479
periapsis or the perigee and when you're

144
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,000
far away in your orbit

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
that's called the apoapsis or the apogee

146
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,720
and keep in mind that all uh free fall

147
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,199
is in orbit it's just most orbits you

148
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,080
are aware of

149
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,000
just hit the ground so if i toss an

150
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,840
object in the air and the green screen

151
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
is gonna

152
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,280
not like me for this but when i toss the

153
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,440
this bottle in the air

154
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,160
uh its apogee was just right there just

155
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,400
a few inches you know above my head

156
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,240
um and then of course if there if it

157
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,759
could fall through the earth it would

158
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,919
and then come right back up to me but of

159
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,199
course it doesn't fall through the earth

160
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,840
that hits the ground

161
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
and of course not all uh not all

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,800
spacecraft

163
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,919
not everything orbits uh goes in a goes

164
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,680
around the equator so sometimes you have

165
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,000
an angle of inclination

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,440
and those are those are important to to

167
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,520
know about too in

168
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,400
in satellite hacking because a lot of

169
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,800
the

170
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,639
weather satellites and a lot of the geo

171
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,000
communication satellites that are in low

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,440
earth orbit

173
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,720
actually have a very polar

174
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
orbit so the angle of inclination is

175
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,919
almost at 90 degrees so it's going

176
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,400
almost

177
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,639
north to south around the earth as the

178
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,199
earth rotates

179
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,800
and this is so it can cover as much

180
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,199
ground as it can when it's taking

181
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,840
pictures

182
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,720
um so yeah let's uh let's look how how

183
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,759
things get into

184
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,080
space using my favorite program kerbal

185
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,759
space program

186
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,960
i'm going to stop this here open

187
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,840
up a video i think

188
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,280
here we go all right and i'm gonna

189
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,840
i'm going to redo the share i think

190
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
sure ah it's working perfect

191
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,639
so here we have a rocket that i made in

192
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,319
kerbal space program and for people that

193
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,400
don't know kerbal space program is a

194
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
video game essentially but it allows you

195
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,160
to design rockets and shoot them into

196
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,800
space

197
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,599
um and here i made a very simple rocket

198
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,360
to go work sort of

199
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,080
the the stuff we talked about before um

200
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,360
so i know it's hard to see

201
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,880
but up in this window at the top right

202
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,199
is where i'm mainly looking at my delta

203
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
v so how much change in velocity i can

204
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,280
get out of this rocket

205
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
and that is the main stat that i'm that

206
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,479
you

207
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,440
you're concerned about when you're

208
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,759
making rockets

209
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,520
and of course like i said you do concern

210
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,880
yourself with the thrust to weight ratio

211
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,319
when you're lifting off

212
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,080
but other than that it's always just

213
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,759
delta v delta v delta v

214
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
how much how much change in velocity can

215
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,919
you get out of your rocket

216
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,199
so we'll take this to the launch bay

217
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,800
and we're just going to lift off now so

218
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,919
we go we start

219
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,759
why we want to go straight up first is

220
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
because gravity

221
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,800
is not the primary

222
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,199
obstacle of getting into space it's the

223
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,000
atmosphere

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,160
we want to get through the atmosphere as

225
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,360
soon as possible is

226
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,680
when we start going fast like you know

227
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
bullet fast or speed of sound fast

228
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,479
the atmosphere stops becoming like this

229
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,759
thin wispy thing

230
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,759
and starts becoming more like a soup so

231
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,120
we got to just punch through the

232
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,879
atmosphere as soon as we can

233
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,400
and as soon as we get to the upper

234
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,319
atmosphere you'll see we'll we'll start

235
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,080
turning in about 45 degrees and this is

236
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,160
what of course rockets in real life do

237
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
uh too as well and the reason why we

238
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,240
want to do this is because

239
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
our end goal is to circularize the orbit

240
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,240
if we were to go straight up

241
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,560
we would just come straight back down

242
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,759
normally um

243
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,280
but we want to get into an orbit so we

244
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
actually want to go up and then

245
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
towards the east um

246
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,520
and so um you'll see right here

247
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,559
yeah is when we jettison the first stage

248
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
so we ran out of fuel with the big

249
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,000
rocket at the bottom

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
we jettisoned it and now we have a much

251
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,839
smaller rocket

252
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,519
uh but that is going to take us the rest

253
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,360
of the way into space

254
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,399
and that's why i was talking about

255
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,839
staging so we have this much smaller

256
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,279
rocket now

257
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,839
and now we're going to sort of position

258
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,160
ourselves so that we're horizontal so

259
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,480
all

260
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,200
our um all our energy is going to go

261
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
towards circularizing the orbit at this

262
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,680
point

263
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,880
because our apogee our apoapsis

264
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,279
is now high enough and we have uh

265
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,800
somebody in the chat okay thank you

266
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,880
um someone in the chat wanted want

267
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,920
someone to meet themselves

268
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,080
okay so um we are now in orbit

269
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
uh we're getting ready to circularize so

270
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,519
here we see a map

271
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,760
um and at this map i'm going to say at

272
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
the apoapsis

273
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,480
at the apogee uh start burning

274
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,519
i'm gonna that's essentially the plan

275
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,120
i'm making and so the way that orbital

276
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,480
mechanics work

277
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,959
is that what you do on your end of the

278
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
node uh affects what happens at the

279
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
opposite end so remember when i said

280
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,279
that

281
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,240
all free fall is in orbit in this case

282
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,680
you can see that it we're in what's

283
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,320
called a sub

284
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
orbital orbital trajectory so we would

285
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,440
go up

286
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
we would hit the apoapsis and then hit

287
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,600
back down if the earth or planet wasn't

288
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
there we would of course go through it

289
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,760
go back

290
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,399
and back into space but what we want to

291
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,480
do is we want us to extend the orbit out

292
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,519
and so that's what we're going to do

293
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,120
we're going to wait until we're at the

294
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,320
height of our orbit

295
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,600
and then we're just going to thrust

296
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,079
eastwards and circularize the orbit

297
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,760
which is going to affect the opposite

298
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,959
side of the orbit

299
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,200
that we're trying to get to so we do

300
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,079
that

301
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,240
and we grow our orbit we grow our orbit

302
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,480
we keep we keep thrusting

303
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,279
and then eventually once oh we stage

304
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
again

305
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,839
so we're now a nice small rocket

306
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
and we circularize the orbit and that is

307
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,760
how things

308
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,399
uh essentially get into a stable orbit

309
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,360
and once it's there

310
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,800
it's there pretty much for good um

311
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,800
now in a low earth orbit configuration

312
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,640
satellites do hit the atmosphere because

313
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,320
there's no

314
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
set boundary uh between the atmosphere

315
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,240
and space uh

316
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,880
for example recently we of course had to

317
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,680
deal with the

318
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,760
chinese um the chinese rocket that was

319
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,360
gonna land somewhere anywhere we didn't

320
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,079
know where

321
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,160
and why was that well that's because

322
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,240
what happens is that the sun

323
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,360
hits the planet uh and that causes the

324
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
atmosphere to expand in unpredictable

325
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,480
ways

326
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
so if you're in a low earth orbit you

327
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,600
will eventually decay from the

328
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,279
atmosphere sort of expanding and you get

329
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,160
little

330
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
whiffs of air slowing you down but of

331
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,560
course if you get out far enough

332
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,959
like you are halfway to the moon you're

333
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,560
basically there for good

334
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,720
um and this is why space junk is a

335
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,560
problem uh right now is because we

336
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
you know we put this stuff up there and

337
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,920
it's not going to come down

338
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,519
right if it's far enough away it's just

339
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,959
going to stay up there

340
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,040
and if that stuff breaks apart the stuff

341
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,399
that breaks apart is going to stay up

342
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,240
there it requires no energy to stay in

343
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,600
orbit you're just falling around the

344
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,079
earth

345
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,600
over and over again all right so any

346
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,560
questions so far

347
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,120
oh yes so we are at at that point we

348
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
would be in a low earth orbit

349
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,240
or in that case a low video game orbit

350
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,279
um to get into a higher orbit of course

351
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:57,920
you would just

352
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,040
extend out your apoapsis um or apogee

353
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
and sort of do the same thing again

354
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,519
right it's it's the same process but you

355
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,519
you just it the difference between a low

356
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,760
earth orbit and a high earth orbit is

357
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,440
just the apogee and of course the

358
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,959
perigee as if those

359
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,560
things are are far out then

360
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,959
um then you're good and you know i don't

361
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,880
i don't know if there's any sort of set

362
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,839
um definitions for low earth orbit

363
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,639
versus

364
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,880
you know high earth orbit but the way

365
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
that i sort of think about it

366
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,440
um and we and you can see this on maps

367
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,399
too if you look at where all the

368
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,360
satellites are

369
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,680
you basically have a bunch of low earth

370
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,360
low earth orbit satellites

371
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,800
and the way that i define that

372
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,120
personally is

373
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,959
they are going to slow down and fall

374
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,160
back to earth eventually

375
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,279
because the atmosphere is dragging on

376
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,480
them a little bit

377
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,639
so like the international space station

378
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,160
is also a

379
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,079
um not just a space station but a

380
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,160
spaceship and they actually have to have

381
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,279
thrusters

382
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,160
uh to keep themselves in orbit because

383
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,920
they are so low that like i said the

384
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,079
earth's atmosphere will expand

385
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,040
and slow them down slowly over time and

386
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,639
so therefore they are in a low earth

387
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,600
orbit

388
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
something like gps which is a bit

389
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,519
further out um

390
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,839
doesn't have that drag so the gps

391
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,440
satellites are good are going to be out

392
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,320
there

393
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,560
you know goodness knows and then further

394
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,720
out from that of course are the

395
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
uh geostationary satellites uh which

396
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
we'll get into in a little bit

397
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,000
um all right so

398
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,519
let's uh go back to the presentation

399
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,360
oh i think someone wrote something in

400
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,199
the chat oh yes

401
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,720
wikipedia does have a great map of

402
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,480
orbits perfect

403
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,240
uh and chris says wikipedia says

404
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,680
um uh low earth orbit is defined as

405
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,880
um an orbital period of 128 minutes i

406
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,320
guess or less

407
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,079
um yep okay so there are some good

408
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,959
good defined limits excellent thank you

409
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,560
for that

410
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,120
um all right so now we know how rockets

411
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
work so let's get into

412
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,079
space hacking cyber security and space

413
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:10,959
um

414
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,600
so the cosmos is also within us we are

415
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,560
the way

416
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,719
the cosmos can hack itself

417
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,519
uh so how does the communication process

418
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,199
between a space vehicle and a ground

419
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,399
station work

420
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,560
well first you have you know your your

421
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,480
mission control center your flight

422
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,920
control center right and then that

423
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,320
usually gets the data from that

424
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,720
um goes through some cryptography

425
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,839
process

426
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,959
through an sdr yes one of those sdrs

427
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,240
like you might have

428
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,079
same thing to an antenna and then

429
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,000
of course then that gets wirelessly

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,079
transmitted uh to the

431
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,680
to the space vehicle right and then just

432
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,519
does the exact opposite

433
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
um process so it takes takes the data

434
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,240
from the antenna

435
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,160
pumps it through an sdr undoes the

436
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,440
cryptography and then

437
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
sends it to like the data handler and

438
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,560
that and the flight

439
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,680
flight computer uh and it's really that

440
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,120
simple of a process

441
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,519
um and so if we look a bit closer at the

442
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,880
space vehicle bus

443
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,000
uh so we have at the left

444
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,079
uh oh scr okay thank you um uh leandra

445
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,440
uh sorry uh yeah um

446
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,240
what is an sdr okay thank you sorry i

447
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,600
sort of assumed everyone i knew what

448
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,639
that is

449
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,440
that's a software-defined radio and we

450
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,040
will talk about that in a

451
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,079
a lot actually uh in this presentation

452
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,639
uh basically use the way traditional

453
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,839
radios worked is you would have

454
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,759
a radio device like an antenna

455
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,600
connected to some hardware that would do

456
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,440
something like decode

457
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,800
fm signals coming from us from

458
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
your local radio station right like so

459
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,720
like wild 949 fm

460
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,920
uh the way that would work is you would

461
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,839
have dedicated circuitry that would take

462
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,959
in the

463
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,399
94.9 megahertz signal fm signal

464
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,800
pump it through a a circuit that would

465
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,480
turn it back into audio

466
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
what a software-defined radio does is it

467
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,399
just takes in the raw signals from the

468
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,040
radio

469
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
and sends it to the computer the

470
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,800
computer then figures out

471
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,120
okay well i'm going to decode this as an

472
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,959
fm signal

473
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,600
and pipe it through like the audio of

474
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,639
your sound system

475
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,079
and that's one of the things that you

476
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,160
can do right away if you get like an sdr

477
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,800
dongle

478
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,839
a usb software defined radio dongle is

479
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,680
of course tune in to your favorite fm

480
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,959
radio stations right on your computer

481
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,320
um and yes so yes most most sdrs are usb

482
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,279
dongles

483
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,959
um i am coming around to the idea that

484
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,399
the best sdrs actually

485
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,279
are uh ethernet based uh for reasons

486
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,399
what we'll get into later

487
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,480
but um yeah the the cheap ones you can

488
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,399
get for like 20 bucks

489
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,720
usb they're fantastic and we're like i

490
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,240
said we're gonna go over this a lot

491
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,600
um because sdrs are everywhere in in

492
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,639
uh space vehicles and ground stations uh

493
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,000
so on the space vehicle we have

494
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,799
the the data coming in from an antenna

495
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,640
going to an sdr so it's all programmable

496
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,319
we don't have any fixed

497
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,880
you know paths uh we we can program it

498
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,959
to handle any sort of radio we want it

499
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,839
uh we can do fm demodulation amd

500
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
modulation change the frequency whatever

501
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,720
so i'll handle the software that goes to

502
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,160
a data handler and that figures out

503
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,359
where it's supposed to go because we

504
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,039
want to have as much separation on the

505
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,160
bus as possible right

506
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
this is for security reasons we don't

507
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,720
want the sensors being able to tell the

508
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,000
thrusters what to do

509
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,360
and vice versa we don't want the

510
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,440
thrusters interacting with the

511
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,120
with the sensors with the um

512
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,760
with the uh sorry someone's writing

513
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,080
something in the chat uh

514
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,880
space hello shenanigans okay uh

515
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,840
murdoch's pal

516
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,000
uh someone wants us to read uh murdoch's

517
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,360
pirates

518
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,880
uh i've never heard of that before um

519
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,280
some applications yeah okay all right

520
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,400
well thank you

521
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,280
um and by the way before this started i

522
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,559
said anyone who has anything

523
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,760
feel free to interrupt me during the

524
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
presentation um this is the best way to

525
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,400
go i found

526
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,160
in uh online online presentations um

527
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,919
anyway so uh yeah you want to keep

528
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,840
everything separate um and you'll notice

529
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,960
there's a few things

530
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,320
up at the top here um and i kind of want

531
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,160
to explain what these are so

532
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,640
what is a torque rod well if you are in

533
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,360
a low

534
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,440
earth orbit um you can still be affected

535
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,039
by earth's magnetism

536
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,120
well that means that if you want to

537
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
rotate your ship

538
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,919
or your space vehicle so it's always

539
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,840
like for example facing the earth

540
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,360
you can have what's called a torque rod

541
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,240
which are basically just magnetic rods

542
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,679
that will keep your spaceship oriented

543
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,080
in

544
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,559
earth's magnetic fields right so it's

545
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,640
basically just like a compass in space

546
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,240
or a compass gyroscope thingy in space

547
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,160
no no energy needed and you can keep

548
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,080
your your spacecraft oriented correctly

549
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,720
it's one of the

550
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,120
the benefits of low earth orbit um and

551
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,280
then next to that we have flywheels so

552
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
let's say we're not

553
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,600
uh in the vicinity of earth

554
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,039
uh well what you can essentially have

555
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,640
are a bunch of gyroscopes right they

556
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,120
just spin around spin around spin around

557
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,960
and you can use that to essentially then

558
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,480
stop them and then

559
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,120
have the spaceship like tilt or twirl in

560
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,919
any different way

561
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,520
um rotational velocity is basically free

562
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,320
um

563
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,559
or or very cheap in space it's only

564
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,760
moving back and forth

565
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,799
that takes fuel um and then for that

566
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,080
like i said if you want to move back and

567
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,480
forth

568
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,559
we have rcs thrusters or reaction

569
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,640
control system thrusters

570
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
these are usually uh monopropellant uh

571
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,160
hydrazine type thrusters that just tell

572
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,080
the spacecraft to move left or right or

573
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,440
also the rotation

574
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,280
sometimes flywheels gets what's called

575
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,600
saturated and so you need the rcs in the

576
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,360
in as a backup to stop some rotation

577
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,160
and then of course you have the

578
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,919
thrusters too so if you want to boost

579
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,280
your orbit or

580
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,440
or go down in orbit you have your

581
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,720
thrusters on your space vehicle and

582
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,559
those are the main components

583
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,760
um and of course we have

584
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,000
you know our payloads and sensors right

585
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,200
so if you're going to scheduling into

586
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,679
space

587
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,480
it's usually going to have a camera or

588
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,120
who knows

589
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,200
um are flywheels used for energy

590
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,640
generation too no they are not

591
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,760
they take energy um i suppose you could

592
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,960
use them for

593
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,840
for some sort of like re-energy taken i

594
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,559
don't think that

595
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,679
that would i think that would probably

596
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,600
complicate it too much uh but they

597
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,520
generally run on electrical energy

598
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,360
uh usually for spacecraft that's going

599
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,200
to be generated by solar panels uh

600
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,799
sometimes by

601
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,159
uh radioactive uh um

602
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,240
uh batteries uh which we can talk about

603
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,520
later um but

604
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,880
the way it works is like i said assist

605
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,360
gyroscopes it that's how flywheels are

606
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,640
they're gyroscopes in space uh and on

607
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
earth we can use flywheels of course to

608
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:50,799
generate

609
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,799
power and to maintain power uh you can

610
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,000
actually do some really cool things with

611
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,720
flywheels

612
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,919
if you get a big enough one you can spit

613
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,360
it up and then it maintains

614
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,640
that it it maintains its

615
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,559
sort of angular velocity um and then it

616
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,400
becomes really hard to stop and it's

617
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,559
one way of storing energy but in space

618
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,559
flywheels are just for

619
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,520
uh maintaining orientation all right

620
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,240
let's

621
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,240
move on clear clear all drawings

622
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,679
uh how do i stop uh drawing

623
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,039
uh mouse there we go uh let's

624
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,520
see okay so we already talked about low

625
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,799
earth medium

626
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,400
earth orbit and geostationary orbit um

627
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,720
so yeah so deal so yeah low earth orbit

628
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,080
like i said very low

629
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,919
interacts with the atmosphere medium

630
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,760
earth orbit or like gps where you have

631
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
things sort of in the middle

632
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,000
geostationary orbit uh means that the

633
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,760
orbit is so far out

634
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,080
from earth that it takes exactly 24

635
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,440
hours to orbit

636
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,960
and that means that if you are looking

637
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,480
at the satellite from earth

638
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,919
it appears to stay still in the sky

639
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,440
and so all geostationary orbital

640
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,559
um equipment is in this thin band

641
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,480
all circling the equator because if it

642
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,200
if it was if it had any incline in the

643
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,679
um in the orbit it would sort of bob up

644
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,640
and down

645
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
in the sky uh and we don't want that so

646
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,320
all of them are this

647
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,240
in this big circle like a ring around

648
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,080
the earth um

649
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
and of course we have deep space so that

650
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,200
those are things that are far away like

651
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,799
things like mars

652
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,360
things at the moon um those all go

653
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:25,840
through

654
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,120
through deep space and we'll talk about

655
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,918
that later as well

656
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
uh so what could possibly go wrong with

657
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,840
going to space well it turns out a lot

658
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,840
uh basically space is a

659
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,080
series of unfortunate events and

660
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,159
whatever can go wrong will go wrong

661
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,000
and it's amazing and anything still runs

662
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,120
because if you think about it right

663
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,360
we're putting equipment in space

664
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,760
uh and then having it run for like 20 30

665
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,679
40 60 years in the case of like what

666
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,360
voyager

667
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,440
uh voyager 1 and 2 went up in the 60s

668
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,039
1960s they're still out there sending

669
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,240
back data

670
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,159
so a lot can go wrong up there right you

671
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,000
have a lot of radiation that can fly the

672
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
electronics you have temperature swings

673
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
right you have so it can go from like

674
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,600
negative

675
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,840
you know 200 degrees celsius up to 400

676
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,280
degrees celsius you know

677
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
you have collisions with like asteroids

678
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,880
and mini asteroids you have collisions

679
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,559
with other satellites which can cause

680
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,559
something called kessler system

681
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,640
syndrome which is where there's so much

682
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,080
space junk that we can no longer even

683
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,200
get up into space

684
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,320
because everything will just hit you

685
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,200
right uh that's that's why space junk is

686
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,080
a problem

687
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,039
uh you can lack testing uh due to

688
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,320
expense right because it you can

689
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,880
it's how hard is it to test a rocket or

690
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,000
test a piece of space

691
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,720
equipment um you have to have very

692
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,520
specialized

693
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,799
you know equipment to do that

694
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,559
specialized conditions uh launch

695
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,159
vibrations of course rockets you know

696
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,520
are just really powerful and they're

697
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,640
shaking and that can

698
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,039
destroy your satellite and of course

699
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,400
sometimes places don't get off the

700
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
launch pad right things either don't get

701
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,640
into space

702
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,159
they explode on the launch pad it's

703
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,840
pretty awesome but unfortunately if you

704
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,480
put

705
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,559
two years of your life in a robot uh

706
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,520
going up into space

707
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,600
and it blows up on launch pad well

708
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,200
that's life um

709
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
how much you can do about that of course

710
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
sometimes uh sometimes the space vehicle

711
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,120
fails to deploy but you know the solar

712
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,880
panels don't unfurl

713
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,960
uh sometimes we were talking about

714
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,640
controlling the rotation sometimes it's

715
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,080
just uncontrollably tumbling you can't

716
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,960
get the

717
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,880
you can't get the gyroscopes online you

718
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
can't get the uh

719
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,520
uh the flywheels to work right uh

720
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
sometimes you can't get it to power on

721
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,240
uh sometimes its own electronics doesn't

722
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,279
you know interferes with

723
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,120
its ability to contact earth uh

724
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,799
sometimes it just deorbits because it

725
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,679
doesn't get into

726
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,559
high enough in orbit or the anomaly

727
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,159
might destroy equipment uh oh

728
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,520
what did i just talk about there the

729
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,039
anomaly so this is something i learned

730
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,240
recently

731
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,000
in the past year or two there is

732
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,520
something called the south atlantic

733
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,480
anomaly

734
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,640
uh basically what this place is is a

735
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,640
region over south america

736
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,840
where things just go wrong likely due to

737
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,080
a

738
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,640
abundance of radiation uh of course when

739
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,440
the

740
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,279
uh the earth has a magnetic field and it

741
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,200
fields radiation coming from the sun

742
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,760
into very specific regions so there's

743
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,600
the south atlantic anomaly

744
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,840
and you can see in this picture to the

745
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,520
right here where

746
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,240
if there are electrical failures on a

747
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,120
spacecraft

748
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
it almost always happens in this region

749
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,600
here uh because of the anomaly yeah it's

750
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,679
sort of like the bermuda triangle as

751
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,880
some people are saying

752
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,720
uh but this is this is real this is not

753
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,559
something you know that is you know made

754
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,520
up or

755
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,000
or legends this thing is you know you

756
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,679
really have to protect your spacecraft

757
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,640
um and of course things go wrong a lot

758
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,559
um let's see with that in mind

759
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,400
um and you can't go up in there and fix

760
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,919
it right you can't go up into space and

761
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,159
be like oh well my spacecraft is now

762
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,600
defunct what am i gonna do um

763
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,840
so yeah so unlike ground computers uh

764
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,440
cyber attacks are not the primary threat

765
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,960
to operation right you have all this

766
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,000
other stuff going on

767
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
um in addition traditional malware

768
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,240
uh is uh anti-malware stuff we run on

769
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,080
our normal systems are impractical due

770
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,600
to power and resource usages a lot of

771
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,880
these systems

772
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
use chips that were developed in like

773
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,159
the 1980s um

774
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,720
because they're they're proven right you

775
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,080
can't have the newest technology going

776
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,840
into space

777
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,720
because you don't know if it's gonna

778
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,480
withstand space

779
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,799
uh so you really need robustness and

780
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,640
isolation right you gotta have your your

781
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,400
spacecraft be able to

782
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,880
be hacked but then be unhackable you

783
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,440
know right

784
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,360
have it have it be able to resume from a

785
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,120
bad situation

786
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,799
and of course like i said isolate your

787
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,799
components so you have your bus

788
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,120
and make sure that the camera can't talk

789
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,080
to the

790
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,039
you know thrusters for example uh many

791
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,840
spacecraft oh this is

792
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,159
okay this gives me nightmares uh and but

793
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:40,960
this is known

794
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,279
publicly so i can tell you this uh many

795
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,200
spacecraft will deliberately disable

796
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,240
encryption

797
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,480
uh if the space vehicle cannot

798
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,200
communicate with anything on the ground

799
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,400
okay so let that sink in for a minute um

800
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,200
if you're if you have a almost all the

801
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,799
equipment in space

802
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,720
have a fallback mode where all the

803
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,080
encryption will be turned off

804
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,159
if you can jam their signal for long

805
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,200
enough

806
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,480
oh jesus that's not good

807
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,440
but that's the way things are um and you

808
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,720
you just have to have that fallback

809
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,919
right because so many things can go

810
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:14,240
wrong

811
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,000
and like i said cyber security is not

812
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the number one destroyer

813
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,600
of satellites in space um

814
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,520
so but what can a threat activity what

815
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,840
can a attacker of satellites do well

816
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,440
they can tell the payload to use all the

817
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,279
power that is a very that has been used

818
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,240
in the past

819
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,080
basically what you do is you um tell the

820
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,559
fly computer as soon as you boot up run

821
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,320
all the equipment take all the pictures

822
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,000
uh send everything to the ground station

823
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,399
as fast as you can so the the

824
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,799
space vehicle boots up it runs all the

825
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,240
stuff and then of course it runs out of

826
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,679
power shuts down again

827
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,440
and then it gets tries to do the same

828
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,039
thing so it's down again and it's stuck

829
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,720
in an endless loop and you essentially

830
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,279
denial of service the whole satellite

831
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,960
and that has been done before on real on

832
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,640
real satellites

833
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,159
uh you can of course compromise the

834
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,760
software-defined radio change

835
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
frequencies that kind of stuff

836
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,120
you can interfere with the navigation

837
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,279
data so the way that

838
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,760
um satellites in space know where they

839
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,200
are

840
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,240
is through star trackers which is

841
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,440
exactly what it sounds like it just

842
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
looks at the positions of the

843
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,520
brightest stars figures out where it is

844
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:19,919
uh

845
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,640
it can figure out where it is based on

846
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:22,960
the

847
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,320
sun that's another good big ball of

848
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,679
light that can be used

849
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,440
to figure out where it is or through gps

850
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,840
gps works in space as well it's not just

851
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,360
a grounding

852
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
so a lot of the low earth orbits

853
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,120
satellites for example have gps

854
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,320
receivers on board

855
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,039
to figure out where they are um and of

856
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,000
course you can

857
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,559
use thrust to mess up or deorbit the the

858
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,279
satellite

859
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,720
uh you can permissively permanently

860
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,039
disable communications by

861
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,960
uh you know reprogramming the computer

862
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
or something of course we already talked

863
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,559
about jamming

864
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,399
you you cannot use certain anti-jamming

865
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,919
technologies in space for various

866
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:00,480
reasons

867
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,080
unfortunately so for example on drones

868
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,600
you might find something like a

869
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,520
frequency hopping spread spectrum

870
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,600
system i'm not gonna get into details

871
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,120
about how it works but essentially it

872
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
just hops around all these frequencies

873
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,120
but because in space you're sharing all

874
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,480
those frequencies with all the other

875
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,039
stuff

876
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,480
um that becomes impossible so all the

877
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,039
uh satellites are susceptible to jamming

878
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,240
of some kind

879
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,679
and of course other countries can

880
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,000
interfere or steal with d design

881
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,720
so we have you know like a like solar

882
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,240
winds um

883
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,440
supply chain vulnerability uh

884
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,440
yes is it only nasa or other tech as

885
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,720
well yes um

886
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,960
this is for this all this applies to

887
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,559
nasa and

888
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,120
other agencies like spacex uh private or

889
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,919
otherwise

890
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,600
uh jaxa all this applies to everyone

891
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,840
everyone's sort of in the same boat

892
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,320
so what can a threat actor do against or

893
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,279
once once again

894
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,760
poison supply chain poison test data so

895
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,360
you think your spacecraft works but it

896
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,320
doesn't

897
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,559
uh take over a ground station so you

898
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,480
have to you know part of maintaining

899
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,399
uh cyber security in space is making

900
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,240
sure that your mission control center

901
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,279
is as secure as possible um and of

902
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:15,919
course just

903
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,840
install malware on the on the boot

904
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,520
loader of the machine you know

905
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,080
they get on they control it and then you

906
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,720
know rewrite

907
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,880
all the software and you have a new

908
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,039
encryption scheme ready ready to go

909
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,440
um do most satellites use gps so it

910
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,720
depends on the satellites

911
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,960
um low earth orbit satellites generally

912
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,840
yes you do use

913
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,279
gps of course once you get out of low

914
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,880
earth orbit

915
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,640
the main thing of course are sun

916
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,000
trackers

917
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,360
and if you are going way out into space

918
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,520
you would use a star tracker generally

919
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,279
but of course you can you can use a star

920
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,640
tracker in

921
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,000
any any orbit um or or a sun tracker the

922
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,200
only thing of course is that if you're

923
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,080
near the earth

924
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,519
then the earth is going to be blocking

925
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,200
about half your view half the time or

926
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,559
all the time i should say

927
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,200
um so gps works really the best if

928
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,399
you're in a low earth orbit

929
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,320
and of course uh sun tracking is really

930
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,760
good if you are

931
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,120
you roughly know the position of the

932
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,880
satellite you just

933
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,679
you know need to yeah you know have it

934
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,480
look at the sun

935
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,240
and of course if you need if you're

936
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,640
going way out into space

937
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,640
where you sort of need um

938
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,159
you know just where you're not gonna

939
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,519
have much interference and you can just

940
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,960
see all the stars very clearly

941
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,120
um yeah then the star tracking is the

942
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,840
best but of course you can combine it

943
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,640
too uh you can't be

944
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,720
yeah uh you can't beat a sexton an

945
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,159
hourglass yeah so actually no this is

946
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,840
really funny because yeah a lot of the

947
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,519
old techniques that we used for

948
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,240
navigation of ships uh back in the day

949
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,080
is what we're using to navigate our

950
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,960
spacecraft in space nothing really gets

951
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,120
old just just evolves

952
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,919
um all right so what can we do so we can

953
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:52,880
do we can have

954
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,720
uh to protect what can we do to protect

955
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,960
our spacecraft right so we can

956
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,799
have watchdog scripts and programs that

957
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,360
make sure everything is going hunky-dory

958
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,679
we can have gold copies to fall back on

959
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,799
so if something goes bad on the

960
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,039
spacecraft we can have a way for it to

961
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,240
reset to a known good state at all times

962
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,240
uh we can have fallback encryption so if

963
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,360
if a encryption scheme fails we have

964
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,799
another set of encryption that we can

965
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,080
use instead

966
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,880
uh before before going into full

967
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,320
decrypted mode

968
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,640
uh the the one thing that i that is very

969
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,919
important of course is to have resource

970
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:28,960
limits right have

971
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,799
um uh sanity checks uh to make sure that

972
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,480
the spacecraft is only doing

973
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,519
what's what it is expected to do

974
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,080
um and of course isolation of buses and

975
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,519
resources so one

976
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,279
thing does not affect another thing if

977
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,720
it gets compromised

978
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,960
uh and so someone asks are most

979
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,640
satellites located in low orbit

980
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,320
absolutely yes the vast majority of

981
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,360
satellites

982
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,600
are in low orbit um this is for a couple

983
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,960
reasons one

984
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,279
it's cheaper that's the number one

985
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,960
reason let's not kid ourselves

986
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,120
um it takes less fuel it is cheaper to

987
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,399
get a low earth orbit

988
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,720
uh but the other of course benefit um is

989
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,600
that

990
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,720
um there's less lag right if you are

991
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,640
putting up starlink for example and they

992
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,559
are putting up like 600

993
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,760
or over 600 startling satellites uh

994
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,480
just just for this the spacex internet

995
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,080
space

996
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,240
thing that they're putting up over 600

997
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,320
over 600 so far

998
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,880
of these satellites in low earth orbit

999
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,399
and um

1000
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,000
and because they're in low earth orbit

1001
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,720
there's less lag

1002
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,320
the speed of light actually becomes an

1003
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,600
issue as soon as you start talking about

1004
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,320
distances in space uh if for example if

1005
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
you're talking on the moon

1006
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,679
it takes about one to two seconds for

1007
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,600
light from the earth to get to the moon

1008
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,080
another second or two for the light to

1009
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
get back

1010
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,679
and of course if you're in geostationary

1011
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,760
orbit it takes

1012
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,679
not a second but you know quite a few

1013
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,840
milliseconds you know to get to

1014
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,760
to a geostationary satellite and so if

1015
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,519
you're using a geostationary satellite

1016
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,559
for internet

1017
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,440
that and that adds a lot of um a lot of

1018
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,240
latency

1019
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,840
so there's a lot of good reasons to put

1020
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,599
things in low earth orbit but of course

1021
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,719
for me the biggest one

1022
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,199
is that things in low earth orbit will

1023
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,800
eventually fall back to earth

1024
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,760
um which is what we really want we don't

1025
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,879
want things staying in space forever

1026
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,879
um so yeah let's hack some satellites

1027
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,800
what do you say

1028
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,520
uh specifically oh sorry someone wrote

1029
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,399
here in the check

1030
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,520
chat or is there any website yes yes uh

1031
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,879
we'll go over that in a bit

1032
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,599
some websites that have this information

1033
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,879
um

1034
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,119
uh specifically websites about space

1035
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,320
vehicle defenses like

1036
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,918
the page right now uh i know i don't

1037
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,679
know too much um

1038
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,960
there are a few books about space

1039
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,800
hacking i don't recommend most of them

1040
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,918
they're pretty bad um i would say if you

1041
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,760
want to learn about space hacking

1042
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,960
join your your local radio club

1043
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,200
um that that's where all the information

1044
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,400
is kept

1045
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,720
if get a ham license join your local ham

1046
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,960
radio club there are people there that

1047
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,359
are

1048
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,880
know everything about space

1049
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,680
communications yes ham radio

1050
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,839
get your ham radio license join a ham

1051
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:10,880
radio club

1052
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,680
um and that's where you're gonna get a

1053
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,119
lot of this information

1054
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,880
unfortunately i don't know of any really

1055
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,480
good good sources

1056
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,320
uh for a book that that will say like

1057
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,640
here's how to hack satellites i should

1058
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,000
write one

1059
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,720
but i'm not at that point yet um anyway

1060
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
so let's hack satellites

1061
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,880
um so we are all related to each other

1062
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
biologically to the earth chemically and

1063
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,480
to the rest of the universe

1064
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,520
via software-defined radios so like like

1065
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,800
i said we're going to be talking a lot

1066
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,560
about software-defined radios in this

1067
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,440
talk

1068
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,839
um so let's talk about light

1069
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,680
polarization

1070
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,640
so when we're talking about

1071
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,160
software-defined radio we're really

1072
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,280
talking about

1073
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,560
receiving radio signals and radio

1074
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,079
signals

1075
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,400
are light okay there's no difference

1076
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,079
other than frequency between

1077
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,680
light and radio waves so

1078
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,359
uh and like light and

1079
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,640
radio waves can also be polarized so

1080
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,920
for example television broadcasts use

1081
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,720
what are called

1082
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,920
horizontal uh polarization so it's

1083
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,160
it's you can think of it like spreading

1084
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,839
out horizontally from the ground

1085
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,800
um if you have what's called a dipole

1086
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,760
antenna

1087
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,920
and let me stop the share here for a

1088
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,880
second

1089
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,839
um so you see my video let me pull out a

1090
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,240
diaper

1091
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,839
okay so this is what's called a dipole

1092
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,280
antenna basically it is

1093
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,359
um and you've see i'm sure you've seen

1094
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,400
these before um

1095
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,759
you have two ends here

1096
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,359
and maybe if you have had a tv in the

1097
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:55,839
past

1098
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,680
sorry you can't see this very well uh

1099
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,520
maybe if you had a tv in the past you it

1100
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,640
would look something like this right you

1101
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,720
would have like rabbit ears pointing up

1102
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
now what they don't tell you is that if

1103
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,000
you actually want the best signal from

1104
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,640
your tv

1105
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,240
you would want the antenna like this

1106
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,839
why would you want the antenna like this

1107
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,839
on top of your tv and not like rabbit

1108
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:14,560
ears

1109
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,800
well that's because the the signal

1110
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,280
coming out from your local tv station

1111
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,560
is actually horizontally polarized

1112
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,720
so it it it's coming in sort of like

1113
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,599
this right

1114
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,359
left right left to right left to right

1115
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,040
left to right right and you can also

1116
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,400
have vertical polarization where the

1117
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,599
signal is coming in

1118
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,240
up and down up and down up and down up

1119
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,280
and down

1120
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,880
um and that's where we're talking about

1121
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,280
um polarization and that's really

1122
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,800
important because if you want to get the

1123
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,839
best signal

1124
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,119
you really want to know what

1125
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,520
polarization this signal is coming from

1126
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,680
um let me go back

1127
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
i did not do that correctly apparently

1128
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,280
um

1129
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,640
it's missing uh

1130
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,560
but anyways that's how it works i'm not

1131
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,680
gonna

1132
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,720
um waste your time by uh debugging that

1133
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,079
since it's pretty much done anyway but

1134
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:10,960
yeah that's how you

1135
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,560
that's all it takes to decode the the

1136
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,280
sound file so you take the sound file

1137
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,520
you put it into this program and you get

1138
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,640
a black and white image

1139
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,960
well two images technically and that's

1140
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,520
called um

1141
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,240
uh automatic picture transmission and

1142
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,599
you'll see those a lot on weather

1143
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,119
satellites

1144
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,839
and that is and if you're gonna start

1145
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,040
hacking weather slides that's the

1146
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,240
perfect place to start

1147
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,640
those sounds come in loud and clear you

1148
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,920
can just put on a pair of headphones

1149
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,520
while you're

1150
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,320
listening on the h on the sdr you can

1151
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,760
see it you can hear if it's coming in

1152
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,320
clearly

1153
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
and then of course it's fairly easy to

1154
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,839
decode

1155
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,040
so let's go back to the share

1156
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,680
here we go so let's talk about that

1157
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,200
um sdr again so

1158
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,400
when we're talking about space

1159
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,760
satellites like think about this for a

1160
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,560
second

1161
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,520
um we want to tune in to something

1162
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,240
that's

1163
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,839
i don't know 1.2 gigahertz

1164
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,440
that's impossible we just don't we can't

1165
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,720
put a two gigahertz signal over

1166
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,359
usb for example uh that that's not going

1167
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:19,839
to work

1168
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,760
right we can't just directly do that uh

1169
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,280
usb runs at

1170
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,760
something like 24 you know

1171
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,880
or something alone and you can't push

1172
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,400
a you know two gigahertz signal through

1173
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,040
usb

1174
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,640
like that just straight up so something

1175
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,400
has to be done there has to be a trick

1176
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,599
and of course there is a trick because

1177
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,720
of course we do have our software

1178
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,240
defined radios

1179
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,359
and that trick is that we can multiply

1180
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,040
a signal coming in with another signal

1181
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,680
and what we get out is the initials the

1182
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,200
initial signal

1183
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,040
minus the signal that we we created

1184
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,880
uh so in this case oops let's we have

1185
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,560
someone in the chat

1186
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,480
uh no satellites are still working and

1187
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,839
are up to 20 years old yes some of the

1188
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,280
satellites are up to 20 years old noaa

1189
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,400
satellites

1190
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,440
do get refreshed frequently though

1191
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,599
so some of them are very old although

1192
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,160
the ones like noah 17 and 18

1193
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,040
are and 19 those are relatively new but

1194
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,640
some are old and

1195
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,720
uh someone heard noah three the other

1196
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,920
day that was put up in the

1197
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,520
or a few weeks ago that was put up in

1198
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,280
the 1970s and that was so exciting can

1199
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,480
you imagine

1200
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,640
having this computer put up in the 70s

1201
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,040
starting to send signals down

1202
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,680
i mean oh my god talk about straight

1203
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,960
great hacking time

1204
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,839
um so yeah so we have uh you have a

1205
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,920
signal coming in from the antenna

1206
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,880
and you have a signal we create and we

1207
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,800
multiply it so like let's say we have

1208
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,640
um 2.1 megahertz right

1209
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,000
or gigahertz 2.1 gigahertz

1210
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,119
uh signal coming in and then we have say

1211
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,800
a two gigahertz uh

1212
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,880
about a two point zero

1213
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,319
uh 2.5 gigahertz

1214
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,680
uh a signal that we're generated

1215
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,480
that gets multiplied and 2.1

1216
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,839
minus 2.05

1217
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,079
equals um

1218
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,000
uh 0.5 gigahertz

1219
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,480
or you know much yeah yeah 50 megahertz

1220
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,680
essentially

1221
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,480
thank you um yeah so we get 50 megahertz

1222
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
50 megahertz so now now we've we've

1223
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,720
essentially created a 50 megahertz

1224
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,560
version of the initial wave

1225
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,480
um now of course we actually get two

1226
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,000
things we get

1227
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,640
in we get this in minus and this plus

1228
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,800
but if we use a low pass filter

1229
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,040
so we say anything under say 70

1230
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,960
megahertz gets filtered out all we get

1231
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,880
is this

1232
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,880
this input right so we we've essentially

1233
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,000
taken the

1234
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,480
high frequency and we turned it into a

1235
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,680
way that we can send it

1236
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,400
as a low frequency signal and that's how

1237
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,359
we're able to get

1238
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,079
high frequencies through the usb okay so

1239
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,760
hang on

1240
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,480
all right um this this all makes this

1241
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,560
will make a lot more sense um now of

1242
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:18,960
course

1243
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,760
we're losing some of that data um when

1244
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,720
we do that

1245
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,839
however if we use both a

1246
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,960
cosine and a sine wave we do the same

1247
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,760
thing with a cosine and a sine wave

1248
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,560
and save both outputs we can recreate

1249
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,000
the original signal

1250
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,079
so we do the same thing again only only

1251
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,760
twice one with a

1252
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,400
we take the the data in from the antenna

1253
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,440
over here

1254
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,079
and then we split it so one goes through

1255
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,280
a cosine

1256
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,560
signal one through a sine wave a cosine

1257
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,920
wave and a sine wave

1258
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,520
we do the same thing again we go through

1259
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,119
a low pass filter

1260
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,440
on both sides so we only get the lower

1261
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,040
frequencies

1262
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,480
um and then the adc this is um

1263
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,200
analog to digital converter uh basically

1264
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,920
taking the

1265
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,839
the analog signal turning it into a

1266
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,119
digital signal

1267
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,400
and we get something called i and q out

1268
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,599
so like a stereo waveform essentially

1269
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,560
and i means in phase and q means

1270
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,319
quadrature so in phase

1271
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,800
for the cosine and quadrature for the

1272
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,079
sine wave and you'll see this a lot in

1273
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,760
sdr and that confused me so much when i

1274
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,359
started sdr there was this iq

1275
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,400
like save iq save iq data what's iq

1276
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,000
well now you know it's the way that we

1277
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,839
get data

1278
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,720
uh into the sdr so it it can pass

1279
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,440
through the bandwidth of like usb

1280
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,280
and all software defined radios i don't

1281
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,359
care if it's in your

1282
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,920
wi-fi uh system i don't care if it's in

1283
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,560
your phone

1284
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,880
they all do this they all take in a raw

1285
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,839
signal

1286
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,839
they multiply it by a sine wave and a

1287
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:52,880
cosine

1288
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,040
and then they get i and q and out out

1289
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,680
and that's what they work with

1290
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,359
all right they're all drawings and next

1291
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,759
slide

1292
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,400
so as i said yeah i stands for in phase

1293
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,440
and q stands for quadrature um

1294
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,680
uh and now the nice thing about i and q

1295
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,359
and this is why we use

1296
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,880
and this is this is very important for

1297
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,440
for digital uh transformation is that

1298
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,079
we can plot i and q on like a circle

1299
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,599
right so we have

1300
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,720
i over here and the x-axis and

1301
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,079
q on the y-axis um

1302
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,040
cs og-tv use the same iq scheme i i

1303
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,640
imagine so

1304
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,440
um and like i said any digital

1305
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,119
information anytime you have an sdr

1306
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,160
it's using inq uh like i said your wi-fi

1307
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:40,960
router does

1308
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,240
your phone does they all do um so you're

1309
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,760
not getting one signal in you're

1310
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,599
actually getting two signals in

1311
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,640
um in the inq which combined together

1312
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,760
and make the original signal but

1313
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,599
actually i and q is really

1314
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,319
uh useful because now we can plot it

1315
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:56,880
like i said

1316
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,160
you can plot i on the x-axis and you can

1317
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,599
plot q

1318
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,520
on the y-axis and there's so much we can

1319
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,920
do with this

1320
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,160
for like encoding data for example um

1321
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,640
remember how i was talking about phase

1322
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,160
and how that's super important for

1323
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,880
digital this is why this is why because

1324
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,040
we have the i and q coming in

1325
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,920
and so based on the phases coming in we

1326
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,720
can

1327
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,400
encode data so here we have something

1328
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,880
called quadrature phase shift key ring

1329
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,440
or qpsk this is a very popular

1330
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,880
form of data transmission it's used in

1331
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,920
wi-fi it's also used in of course

1332
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,119
spacecraft

1333
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,880
and it basically is it's pretty

1334
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,480
universal for

1335
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,800
digital transmissions and the way it

1336
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,079
works is that so you have

1337
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,119
q going up and down here right this is q

1338
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,560
on the y axis and then you have i

1339
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,920
on on the x axis and then you use

1340
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,040
something called a

1341
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,319
phase lock loop uh to read

1342
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,400
the data at during different phases

1343
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,240
or during the same phase every every

1344
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,240
rotation so it's

1345
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,280
uh if you read for example um

1346
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,640
at the first you you read it first and

1347
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,200
it's in the

1348
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,200
and the i and q is in the upper right

1349
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,520
quadrant you have a one and a one

1350
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,000
if it is for example you read it and you

1351
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,560
have

1352
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,720
i and q in the lower right quadrant it's

1353
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,640
a one and a zero

1354
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,880
and you can encode you know two bits at

1355
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,160
a time

1356
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,680
and the nice thing about this is that if

1357
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,119
there's a lot of info interference

1358
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:33,839
that's fine

1359
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,680
because you have all this space over

1360
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,640
here to deal with interference

1361
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,680
um the you need uh

1362
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,520
the more advanced these things get um

1363
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,520
you know the less resistant they are to

1364
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,280
interference but for

1365
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,160
a bpsk which is just two sides and qpsk

1366
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,359
which is the quad

1367
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,480
the the the four squares you see

1368
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,880
uh they're very immune to interference

1369
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,240
but you can encode a few bits at the

1370
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,839
same time so you can get a lot of data

1371
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:02,560
through

1372
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,480
uh using these types of encoding using

1373
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,000
phases um

1374
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,520
let's clear again

1375
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,720
uh and yeah so you can use uh we can see

1376
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,160
this in in sdr

1377
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,119
sharp uh str sharp is the common program

1378
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,559
used for

1379
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,119
uh listening to software defined radio

1380
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,119
and you'll see it hold on in this

1381
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,319
screenshot

1382
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,920
let me down here

1383
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,599
so right now what i'm doing is i'm

1384
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,599
demodulating a satellite called meteor

1385
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,720
m2

1386
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,079
that uses a qpsk to send a digital

1387
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,839
signal back down to earth

1388
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,760
and you can use the same the same uh

1389
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,359
antenna that we that i talked about

1390
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,280
earlier

1391
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,839
uh but you'll see that there's the four

1392
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,839
uh the four lines here right the four

1393
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,520
the four faces it can be in

1394
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,119
and of course there's some interference

1395
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,040
we're talking about signals from space

1396
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,559
so it's kind of all you know spread out

1397
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,640
around here but there's clearly a

1398
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,359
pattern right

1399
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,640
like most of the signals are in the

1400
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,920
sensor here and you can clearly tell

1401
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,680
where everything's supposed to be right

1402
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,599
so if a signal is in this quadrant you

1403
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,800
know it's supposed to be a

1404
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,839
what was it um uh zero

1405
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,760
yeah one zero so if so if there's a dot

1406
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,160
down in that in the lower right quadrant

1407
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,800
so in this one all those correspond to

1408
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,880
like one zero

1409
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,079
in binary so this we it just gets those

1410
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,440
dots over and over again

1411
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,760
and then creates a it demodulates the

1412
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,880
signal back into binary

1413
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,960
and so you can get some pretty good

1414
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,960
images uh using this digital

1415
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,520
uh encoding now unfortunately when you

1416
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,160
listen to it like you do with like an fm

1417
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,480
uh you know demodulation it just sounds

1418
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,760
like nothing

1419
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,640
um it's all just phase stuff on the bass

1420
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,760
carrier

1421
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,359
but you do get you do get much better

1422
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,440
images using digital modulation

1423
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,200
and so if you have

1424
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,640
less interference you can do some really

1425
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,760
cool stuff with this

1426
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,559
and this is how wi-fi works um if you

1427
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,400
have a strong wi-fi signal you'll

1428
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,920
you'll incorporate amplitude with

1429
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,079
phase modulation for something called

1430
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,520
qam

1431
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,640
quadrature amplitude modulation

1432
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
so if you have a a signal for example

1433
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,640
that is let me change the color here to

1434
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,319
blue if you have a signal that is

1435
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:27,680
very you know high in amplitude

1436
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,280
you're going to get a dot in like this

1437
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,160
area right

1438
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,920
you're going to get dot in that area and

1439
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,680
that's corresponds to zero zero

1440
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,240
zero zero four bits oh that's a lot but

1441
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
of course if you have a signal with low

1442
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,839
amplitude

1443
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,079
uh you're you get you'll get a signal

1444
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,119
down here and that's like

1445
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,440
one one one one so you can actually

1446
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,040
encode four bits at a time

1447
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,200
and you get to like you know uh i think

1448
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,880
this is 16

1449
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,920
qam it gets like 128 qam um and the way

1450
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,960
your wi-fi

1451
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,040
router works is that if you have a good

1452
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,640
signal it'll use something like you know

1453
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,000
128 qam or 256 qam

1454
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,240
but if it has a weak signal it'll use

1455
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,200
something like

1456
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,400
uh the base um cube

1457
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,160
psk that we saw earlier so something

1458
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,440
like this so if you have a weak wi-fi

1459
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,319
signal

1460
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,680
it'll fall back to something like this

1461
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,680
for an encoding but if you have a very

1462
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,480
strong signal

1463
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,920
it'll do something like this and that's

1464
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,520
how all pretty much all digital

1465
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,440
communication works

1466
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,480
um yeah uh there

1467
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,920
we do have a project um

1468
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,200
uh where we decode a a bpsk signal

1469
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,319
so it says two sides uh but given the

1470
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:37,040
time

1471
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,520
um and the complexity of that um i'm

1472
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,400
gonna

1473
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,839
skip that for now but we do have a

1474
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,559
project about that

1475
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,280
um so let me clear clear all the

1476
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,000
drawings

1477
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,839
uh so so far we talked about grabbing

1478
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,359
images from low earth orbiting

1479
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,079
satellites

1480
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,640
and that's a lot of fun uh however of

1481
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,760
course you have to wait

1482
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,280
and you have to plan out when they're

1483
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,960
going to fly overhead

1484
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,520
there are weather satellites uh that are

1485
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,280
in geosynchronous orbit

1486
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,800
so they're always up in the sky you can

1487
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,400
get them any time you're just not

1488
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,480
getting too much interference

1489
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,119
and the two most famous of these are

1490
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:11,760
goes

1491
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,480
16 and 17. otherwise known as goes east

1492
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,160
and goes west

1493
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,079
one is over the pacific ocean one is

1494
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,160
over the atlantic ocean

1495
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,760
obviously we would be going for goes

1496
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,240
west or go 17.

1497
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,359
um and like i said these are

1498
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,440
geostationary satellites

1499
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,079
now unfortunately uh because they are so

1500
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:30,720
far away

1501
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,800
geostationary satellites are

1502
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,000
yeah thousands of kilometers away um

1503
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,760
you you need a dish to amplify the

1504
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,440
signal or

1505
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,160
boost the signal i yeah let's just put

1506
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,040
it like that uh

1507
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,760
you need a dish uh to grab it now you

1508
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,400
can use

1509
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,599
a 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi dish and modify it

1510
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,119
and there are lots of examples of this

1511
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,480
online

1512
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,119
uh goes uses 1.7 gigahertz so it's

1513
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,520
really close to 2.4

1514
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,680
and this is actually my dish that i use

1515
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,760
um at the moment uh that's my dish

1516
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,119
pointed actually at code 17 right now um

1517
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,200
and it's just like i said a modified

1518
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,240
wi-fi dish

1519
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,559
um but you can get some really cool

1520
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,160
images off ghosts because like i said

1521
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,160
it's 24 7.

1522
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,880
um it's it's far enough away you get a

1523
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,160
full disk image of earth

1524
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,839
and these are these are actual images

1525
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,920
like they pulled off of

1526
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,720
of that satellite um so for these images

1527
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,400
the one on the left of course is

1528
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,839
earth straight above and you can

1529
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:32,800
actually kind of figure out where the

1530
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,000
satellite is

1531
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,079
based on where you're looking at earth

1532
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,920
and the image on the right is a close-up

1533
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,480
of

1534
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,119
alaska

1535
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,119
and of course there are satellites

1536
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,240
beyond earth orbit too right we have

1537
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,720
mars orbiters and we have voyager one

1538
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,839
and two we have

1539
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,280
juno projects um uh let me see so are

1540
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,400
these

1541
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,920
things like xm uh whether

1542
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,559
get their images yes um so actually if

1543
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,920
you go online

1544
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,599
so i did this the hard way so the hard

1545
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,599
way of course is to get an antenna like

1546
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,880
this

1547
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,359
set up something like ghost tools

1548
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:12,800
there's a github page for it you know

1549
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,000
and get the images and

1550
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,920
decode the the h writ signals um

1551
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,400
uh by the way um goes uses bpsk so buy

1552
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,760
phase shift keying so two uh zero on the

1553
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,200
left one on the right

1554
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,880
essentially um i did it the hard way

1555
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,599
goes has or i should say noah who

1556
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,960
operates these headlights

1557
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,760
has all the images to download online

1558
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,319
and

1559
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,000
if you were to go on to for example

1560
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,520
zoom.earth

1561
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,800
that's actually where they get the

1562
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,040
images to do that um it's all shared

1563
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,319
online it's all free

1564
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,079
you're not breaking any laws by you know

1565
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,680
downloading the images

1566
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,680
uh you're just learning how spacecraft

1567
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,440
works

1568
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,319
um so okay let's talk about the spa deep

1569
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,839
space network

1570
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,599
uh so we talk about the internet a lot

1571
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,920
on earth um

1572
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,680
for you know our network on earth um

1573
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,599
uh but beyond earth there's the deep

1574
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:08,960
space network

1575
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,200
so that's like the the internet for

1576
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,520
everything that's not on earth

1577
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,160
all spacecraft uh beyond low earth orbit

1578
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,079
is on the dsn or beyond i should say

1579
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,960
geostationary orbit is on the dsm

1580
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,400
uh and the way it works is that we have

1581
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,319
a few listing stations in three areas of

1582
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,359
the world that

1583
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,240
that are 120 degrees apart that look at

1584
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,800
all parts of the sky at any given moment

1585
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,920
so one is in goldstone california one is

1586
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,280
in madrid

1587
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,960
and one is in canberra australia

1588
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,520
and oh thank you samuel has an image has

1589
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,240
a link to

1590
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,839
some ghost images excellent

1591
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,680
so the way it works is that uh

1592
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,960
you have a image coming from

1593
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,040
for example space and depending on

1594
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,079
you know what is listening at the time

1595
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,200
you know it can pick it up and then

1596
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,119
relay it to each other

1597
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,119
and the reason why you need a special um

1598
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,119
uh you need a special sort of

1599
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,319
um network for space

1600
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,799
is because stuff just gets lost up there

1601
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:17,599
right

1602
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,480
you don't know if you're gonna get a

1603
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,920
good signal through you don't know if

1604
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,760
you're going to get a pass ready where

1605
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,200
you can send the data down

1606
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,920
you need you need a network that is

1607
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,720
going to be

1608
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,319
very tolerant to these sort of things

1609
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,680
and that's where delay tolerant

1610
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,520
and that's where the dsm comes in and

1611
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,440
you can actually view the

1612
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,559
dsn live right now like what it's doing

1613
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,480
um straight on the internet um at

1614
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,440
eyes.nasa.gov

1615
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,079
dsn you can actually see what is doing

1616
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,599
it right now and maybe it's

1617
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:48,799
probably right now they're talking to

1618
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,280
mars because of the rover there but

1619
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,040
you'll see what it's doing um

1620
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,599
but yeah so so the reason why we need

1621
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,920
this is because we really need the data

1622
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,880
to be

1623
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,079
resilient to delays and disruptions and

1624
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:04,880
so

1625
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,640
on the internet on earth of course we

1626
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,680
use tcp

1627
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,200
what makes the deep space network

1628
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,200
different is that they use something

1629
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,599
called dtn or delay tolerant networking

1630
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,359
protocol and there is a once again

1631
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,359
a um an activity you can do

1632
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,280
where you actually set up dtn at home i

1633
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,640
think sam

1634
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,119
created this a few years ago uh you can

1635
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:29,760
actually

1636
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,400
have two ubuntu or two linux computers

1637
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,240
talk to each other using dtn

1638
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,760
i mean it's not any different than you

1639
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,960
know tcp but it's just a different

1640
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,319
protocol that you can

1641
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:41,760
that you can use um

1642
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,319
and of course if you have the space and

1643
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,920
if you have the

1644
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,119
uh money you can listen to the

1645
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,799
dsm yourself there's absolutely no

1646
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,200
reason why you can't set up a big

1647
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,440
you know two meter satellite dish and

1648
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,880
start listening for signals from deep

1649
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,160
space

1650
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,240
and there's a big community about that

1651
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,720
does exactly that

1652
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,720
um and so yeah let's talk a little bit

1653
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,760
about uh

1654
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,920
fpgas just let's segue

1655
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,760
uh let's see uh m 602 ion dt yes

1656
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,720
thank you uh sam has a link to the to

1657
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,319
the project

1658
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,359
uh let's talk a little bit about fpgas

1659
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,440
and stop talking about uh radio for a

1660
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,559
second

1661
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,119
one of the differences between what you

1662
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,079
see in space

1663
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,319
and what you have on earth is that most

1664
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:31,920
things on earth of course come from mass

1665
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,880
production

1666
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,079
so you produce you know two million

1667
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,040
dell laptop computers and they go out

1668
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,240
and they do

1669
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,400
their thing in space everything is

1670
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,319
usually fairly custom so you're going to

1671
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,799
find a lot of custom hardware on

1672
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:49,119
on spacecraft and the way that custom

1673
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,640
hardware is developed

1674
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,319
is through something called a field

1675
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,160
programmable gate array

1676
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,280
so if you really want to know like

1677
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,839
the hardware on top of on on spacecraft

1678
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:00,960
you really have to know

1679
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,440
uh what these field programmable gate

1680
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,799
arrays are

1681
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,400
and essentially the way they work is

1682
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,480
that you have a bunch of inputs

1683
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,160
connected to it what are called uh

1684
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,000
control logic blocks or configurable

1685
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,200
logic blocks

1686
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,280
and each configurable logic plot comes

1687
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,440
with something like you know um

1688
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,200
an and uh some a logic

1689
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,359
table um uh some flip-flops

1690
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,359
and you just sort of program each one

1691
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,520
and you can use that to create

1692
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,000
uh gates and connect the gates together

1693
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,359
and pretty soon if you have enough of

1694
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,119
these clbs you can make your own custom

1695
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,119
microprocessor

1696
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,040
you know and oh my god that is so cool

1697
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,440
and you absolutely need these in space

1698
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,280
uh because there's you know like i said

1699
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,799
you're throwing up one

1700
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,880
goes 16 and one goes 17. you're not

1701
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,000
making a mass

1702
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,440
production run of these

1703
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,720
and some of the earlier um fpgas you can

1704
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,160
actually see the dies they were big

1705
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,640
enough that you can see each

1706
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,079
control logic block um in this image

1707
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,520
here so if you look really carefully i

1708
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,880
know it's hard to

1709
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,119
hard to see but one of this early

1710
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,880
fpga has each little logic block here

1711
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,880
that's barely barely visible but

1712
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,160
definitely there

1713
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,920
are they remotely programmable yes they

1714
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,359
absolutely are remotely programmable

1715
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:20,799
that's the other thing too

1716
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,480
uh because so many things can go wrong

1717
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,920
sometimes you need

1718
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,680
to fix the hardware on on the spacecraft

1719
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,040
so that's one of the other other

1720
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,119
benefits is that not only can you

1721
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,280
reprogram them and make custom hardware

1722
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,400
on on the ground

1723
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,680
but you can reprogram them in space um

1724
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,520
to fit the needs of what you're trying

1725
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,799
to do so if there's a change in

1726
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,640
in the mission and there almost always

1727
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,160
is because things go wrong

1728
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,078
you can reprogram these these devices

1729
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,119
uh and so i would have an fpga demo in

1730
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,520
fact i have my board out

1731
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,200
right here i don't know if you can see

1732
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,960
that but

1733
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,520
um the software is not running on my

1734
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,559
system currently

1735
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,920
needless to say i can configure this

1736
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,000
device this is about 150

1737
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,440
the center chip here is a standard

1738
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,520
fpga and i can configure this into a

1739
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,240
system on a chip um it's possible

1740
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,160
actually to use these fpgas

1741
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,520
and recreate older systems so i can

1742
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,040
for example put the code on here that

1743
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,040
turns this into an actual apple ii

1744
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,079
computer like not not emulating

1745
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,799
like actually create a you know 6502

1746
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:33,680
processor

1747
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,400
on some of the logic blocks and then

1748
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,160
connect that up to like a video output

1749
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,920
and and actually create an apple ii on

1750
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,200
here i mean you can

1751
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,480
there's a lot of stuff you can do on

1752
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,799
these um

1753
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:47,839
and if you have not heard about it uh

1754
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,119
there's something called the mr project

1755
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:51,280
m-i-s-t-e-r

1756
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,240
it was first it's it originally stood

1757
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:54,640
for

1758
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,280
mist the amiga atari st project

1759
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,119
but it sort of grew from that and it's

1760
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,200
it's this entire collection of cores of

1761
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,200
old computers and consoles like the

1762
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,520
super nintendo the amiga of course the

1763
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,559
atari

1764
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,000
uh macintosh plus that run on fpgas that

1765
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,400
you can buy

1766
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,359
so let's talk about operating systems in

1767
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,599
space um

1768
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,839
we do not use windows on our spacecraft

1769
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,920
now windows is absolutely in play

1770
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,359
on things like the international space

1771
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,760
station as is i think ios

1772
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,119
i've seen some ipads on the iss

1773
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,920
um but in terms of like spacecraft our

1774
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,839
you know spacecraft are not going to be

1775
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,440
running

1776
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,760
um you know windows or linux uh with the

1777
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,799
exception

1778
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,119
of that uh ingenuity copter that

1779
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,520
ingenuity copter is running linux but

1780
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,599
usually they don't run linux or windows

1781
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:50,720
something else

1782
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,400
um and what is that something else it's

1783
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,760
called a real-time operating system

1784
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,359
so why is that important if you

1785
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:01,760
are running a rocket you're trying to

1786
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,200
make very precise

1787
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,480
maneuvers every millisecond counts

1788
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,559
and you can't have your rocket fire for

1789
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,480
a few extra milliseconds

1790
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,480
because the operating system decided

1791
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,920
that now would be a good time to

1792
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,000
defragment the hard drive

1793
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,079
you know you or or switch to something

1794
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:19,520
else really quickly

1795
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,359
what a real-time operating system does

1796
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,119
is it allows you to specify

1797
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,720
very specifically when you want programs

1798
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,280
to run

1799
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,200
and when you want the background

1800
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,400
applications to run

1801
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,960
and you can set it so that if you have

1802
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,280
something that's time critical like

1803
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,839
a rocket you know going off you can do

1804
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:38,960
that

1805
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,599
uh the the most common one used in space

1806
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,680
is wind river vx works real-time

1807
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,960
operating system

1808
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,960
this is all over the space all over the

1809
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,240
place in space

1810
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,920
if you have a spacecraft it's i can

1811
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,000
assure you there's about a 90

1812
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,039
chance it's running vx works uh

1813
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,280
unfortunately you cannot buy this

1814
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,200
you know normally um it it's

1815
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,200
there's no free version um but

1816
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,440
uh that that's what's used uh but there

1817
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,480
is free rtos

1818
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,079
which is put out by um amazon

1819
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,160
and actually the reason why i had this

1820
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,000
out is because i have free rts running

1821
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,599
on a cpu

1822
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,680
um on this but unfortunately it's not

1823
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,039
running right now um

1824
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,799
but yeah uh freert if you want to play

1825
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,240
with a uh

1826
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,559
with a real-time operating system free

1827
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:27,280
rtos

1828
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,039
is available to use and i would highly

1829
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,839
recommend that one instead

1830
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,680
um and of course let's talk about the

1831
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,559
software

1832
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:37,599
involved we've talked a lot about the

1833
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,039
hardware you know the how the signals

1834
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,000
get there

1835
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,799
what it's run on but what software is

1836
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,240
being run on spacecraft

1837
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,480
and almost all of it is open source and

1838
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,079
so we can play around with it

1839
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,359
which is very nice uh so mission control

1840
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:52,319
software

1841
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,640
we all have seen the images of nasa

1842
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,400
their mission controls

1843
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,920
uh and you know a lot of people are

1844
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,680
wondering what are they running

1845
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,119
on the big screens and what are they

1846
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,280
using to to monitor their space

1847
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,400
spacecraft the most common one is the mx

1848
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,520
why am i y-a-m-c-s or

1849
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,480
yeah uh yet another mission control uh

1850
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,520
system

1851
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,640
yamiche um it's yamas

1852
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,480
it's just it just displays things uh you

1853
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,920
can check it out at yammix.org

1854
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,680
yamcs.org uh the other one

1855
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,359
is openmct um open mission control

1856
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,680
something um that's another one you can

1857
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,039
use it uses more of a

1858
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,599
web page interface to monitor missions

1859
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:34,880
but you'll see these all over mission

1860
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,160
control

1861
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,280
stations and the biggie

1862
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,440
that is on everything is that the core

1863
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,280
flight system once again

1864
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,559
another big open source product uh

1865
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,760
project hosted by nasa on github

1866
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,119
core flight system is

1867
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,039
on every spacecraft it's what controls

1868
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,960
every satellite is what controls every

1869
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,559
rocket

1870
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:04,000
um if you're if you do any drone work

1871
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
you'll know that drones for example i

1872
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,520
have a project called

1873
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,640
uh autopilot uh which is like an open

1874
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,038
source

1875
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,520
drone piloting piece of software that's

1876
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,400
on everything right you can't escape it

1877
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,400
uh this is the same thing but for space

1878
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,240
there's uh i can't think of a single

1879
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,000
satellite or a single spacecraft that

1880
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,720
does not run

1881
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,960
core flight system if you want to know

1882
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:27,920
how to

1883
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,960
you know how these systems operate um

1884
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,200
core flight system is the way to go

1885
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,720
unfortunately i do not have a project

1886
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,480
with this yet but i am definitely going

1887
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,079
to make a core flight system

1888
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:39,760
uh project for for everyone to do in the

1889
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,079
future

1890
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,200
um and yeah so let's talk about uh the

1891
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,799
current projects and where things are in

1892
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,880
in the community oh we have a question

1893
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,319
i don't think we have any ransomware in

1894
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:52,400
space yet yeah i'm that's that's the

1895
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,280
other thing too

1896
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,319
um so most

1897
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,000
ransomware like i said most systems in

1898
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,599
space do not run windows or linux they

1899
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,520
run a real-time operating system and

1900
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,160
there's usually

1901
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,359
not many files in space it is absolutely

1902
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,200
possible to take over a satellite

1903
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,960
um and you know take it for ransom i

1904
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,760
suppose

1905
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,039
uh in some way maintaining maintaining

1906
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,079
it under your control

1907
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,000
will be difficult but it is technically

1908
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,359
possible to do that

1909
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:23,200
do and the only the issue is that

1910
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,039
it would create a international incident

1911
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,280
for sure if someone were to do that

1912
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,160
um it's it's sort of like you know how

1913
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,039
everyone's up in arms about the recent

1914
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,599
uh oil uh situation the pipeline

1915
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:36,880
situation

1916
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,480
it would be that be like that but at

1917
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,079
like a thousand fold

1918
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,520
if someone went after satellites like

1919
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,520
that it would be a huge i don't think

1920
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,119
that the

1921
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,960
that the potential profits outweigh the

1922
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,520
cost

1923
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,880
of of creating that uh interesting uh

1924
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,720
says uh unstable um uh we can harden

1925
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,520
against scam

1926
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,359
x but we can't we're still vulnerable to

1927
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:00,640
crypto uh hacking

1928
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,119
yes absolutely because of course we have

1929
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,720
to get the data in and like i said

1930
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,160
if you get that if you get a satellite

1931
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,280
in an inoperable state it will drop all

1932
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,480
encryption

1933
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,079
uh and you know and try to communicate

1934
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,240
as best it can back to base

1935
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,160
uh so it's absolutely possible to you

1936
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,000
know undo the encryption on on

1937
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,200
any or most satellites and

1938
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,680
you know get access to it now of course

1939
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,039
the problem is that

1940
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,559
you need the command dictionary right

1941
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,559
away people are going to notice if the

1942
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,039
satellite starts misbehaving

1943
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,640
um so you know if you were to do an

1944
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,520
attack like that

1945
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,720
you would have to have the command

1946
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,799
dictionary ready to go

1947
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,240
and ready to send up the command right

1948
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,480
away and if you don't have that

1949
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,240
then mission control is going to you

1950
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,000
know regain control the satellite as

1951
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,559
soon as possible

1952
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,680
um is is it possible to send a correct

1953
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,599
corrupt update yes absolutely once again

1954
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:56,880
you would have to know the command

1955
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,839
dictionary of the

1956
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,359
of the system though in order to in

1957
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,599
order to do that

1958
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,920
um so yeah so one of my current projects

1959
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,960
is making a

1960
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,400
azimuth uh elevation rotator uh one of

1961
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,440
the things

1962
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,960
with tracking satellites is you gotta

1963
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,920
track satellites

1964
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,440
um and you have to track them pretty

1965
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,600
precisely for example earlier we were

1966
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,040
talking about the noaa

1967
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,080
you know 15 16 you know 17

1968
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,960
and their apt transmissions well those

1969
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,600
are

1970
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,600
are nice for us to learn how to how to

1971
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,640
do space

1972
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,238
hacking because they're easy to get

1973
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,238
they're meant for the general public

1974
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,080
uh those satellites also believe it or

1975
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,279
not

1976
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,198
send down high resolution images on

1977
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,120
another frequency

1978
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,640
unfortunately the that requires

1979
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,080
precise tracking of the satellite um

1980
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,520
using a a rotating device that has to

1981
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,120
rotate you know left and right

1982
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,158
or azimuthly and up and down

1983
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:57,040
or through elevation uh and those are

1984
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,759
not cheap

1985
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,238
oh my gosh there's only one on the

1986
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:02,960
market i can i can think of that's

1987
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,238
uh put out um and it's like 800 just for

1988
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:08,479
the rotating part and another like 400

1989
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,960
for the

1990
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,359
computer control and it's just

1991
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:12,238
ridiculous

1992
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,439
um but this guy came along ham radio i'm

1993
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:16,640
going to say this a lot

1994
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,319
if you want to learn about space hacking

1995
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,319
first things to do

1996
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:22,000
get your ham radio license join a ham

1997
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,679
radio club

1998
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,880
uh this guy made one using some

1999
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,000
standard servo parts um and

2000
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,880
you know put up the code his name is w

2001
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:33,679
his code

2002
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,759
or his ham radio operator call sign is

2003
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:36,960
wb0

2004
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,719
oew um and he made this and prove that

2005
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,238
it's it's a doable concept

2006
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,439
i was actually thinking about this for a

2007
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:44,960
long time but i didn't want to invest

2008
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,000
like 500

2009
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,920
only to find out that it can't be done

2010
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,279
so this guy has a has a working

2011
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:50,238
prototype

2012
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:52,319
but i thought you know hey this is cool

2013
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,920
it can be better

2014
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,159
uh so let's see some of the stuff that

2015
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,320
that this person did on his design

2016
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,159
uh is that he put for example um this

2017
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,560
device here which is a magnetometer

2018
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,880
or acceler and accelerometer which tells

2019
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,040
where it's pointing

2020
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,400
it's attached by rotes on on a pvc pipe

2021
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,440
we can do better than that

2022
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,320
and it is kind of rotating off off

2023
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,000
center here you can see how it's kind of

2024
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,800
lifted up

2025
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,239
off like it the the gear is here

2026
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:27,280
right but it's rotating off center

2027
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,239
which is going to add extra it's gonna

2028
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:31,440
need extra torque

2029
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,360
um but we can do something better so

2030
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,280
what i'm working on right now is

2031
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,600
uh this idea right here that i threw up

2032
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,199
in cad and i'm currently waiting for all

2033
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,480
the pieces to come

2034
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,560
uh but essentially the way this works is

2035
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,080
that it's the same idea you have two

2036
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,520
motors one

2037
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,640
uh rotates around a central point here

2038
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,159
um for the uh uh

2039
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,800
azimuth and then there's another motor

2040
01:10:58,800 --> 01:10:59,679
here

2041
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:03,360
that spins this rod um that will do the

2042
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,159
elevation

2043
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,920
and what what this does a little

2044
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,040
differently is that one there's more

2045
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,560
support

2046
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,880
but also you'll notice that everything

2047
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,480
is is nicely squared off

2048
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,800
so i'll i'll probably host i'll probably

2049
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
pin the accelerometer

2050
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,960
uh compass thing uh on top here um

2051
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,320
and it's all made out of metal there's

2052
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,400
no pvc pipe um and

2053
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,199
everything will be nice and

2054
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,600
counterbalanced so that'll be cool

2055
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,360
uh and let's see what else is going on

2056
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,199
in the community right now that was big

2057
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:36,800
uh there was a spacex

2058
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,440
uh so it turns out i didn't do this this

2059
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,560
was not me

2060
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,360
these are other people um they did a

2061
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,400
falcon 9

2062
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,440
um they recorded the signals from falcon

2063
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:47,920
9

2064
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,600
and figured out that it was actually

2065
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,800
sending an mpeg stream

2066
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,480
so they so they ended up getting the raw

2067
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,239
data from the falcon 9 rockets that were

2068
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,520
going up

2069
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,840
and getting things like internal tank uh

2070
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:02,880
data

2071
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,640
images like what's going on inside the

2072
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,960
tanks of the falcon 9 rockets

2073
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,800
and apparently um

2074
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,000
spacex did not like that uh because now

2075
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
these falcon 9 video signals are all

2076
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,679
encrypted

2077
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:21,679
uh this this person um root was the

2078
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,640
main person behind the the falcon 9

2079
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,840
decrypting

2080
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,840
of the data it was just an ampeg stream

2081
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,640
uh probably encoded using bpsk

2082
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,360
um but yeah they no longer let you do

2083
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:33,760
that

2084
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,040
unfortunately yeah so sad

2085
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,520
uh and if you have an image oh uh samuel

2086
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,120
says if you have amateur radio ham

2087
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,520
license you can point antenna at amsats

2088
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,560
yes amateur satellites uh yes

2089
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,280
um if you have an if you have an amateur

2090
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,000
radio

2091
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,560
ham license not only can you receive

2092
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,520
from space

2093
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,360
you can send from space including the

2094
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,640
international space station the

2095
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,800
international space station has

2096
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,600
a ham radio equipment on board intended

2097
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,040
for you to use

2098
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,480
you know this is not like oh they have

2099
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,800
it and you know if you are

2100
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,880
a hacker you can get on there no you can

2101
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,840
use

2102
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,840
the the equipment on the international

2103
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,000
space station to send data and that was

2104
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,280
actually last month's project i was

2105
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,960
working on which was a um

2106
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,800
a way to stomp out other people trying

2107
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,360
to uh stomp me out on the uh

2108
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,719
getting access to the international

2109
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,520
space station uh so yes absolutely

2110
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,239
um but yeah fun's over

2111
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,239
um and then yeah so that is the

2112
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:35,920
end so far of the presentation do we

2113
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,159
have any questions

2114
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:47,520
before we go into some of the projects

2115
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,520
uh gm rice writes does your org hire

2116
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,520
part-time consulting contractors

2117
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,239
doing part-time work how does someone

2118
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:56,800
get

2119
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,800
involved with part-time projects at your

2120
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,199
org or similar

2121
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:04,880
um so my organization uh

2122
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,679
the telegraph company which does a lot

2123
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:08,159
of space

2124
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:11,280
things hires a lot of interns

2125
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,840
um and if you are interested in

2126
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,840
in a field that

2127
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,239
is related to telegraphs or space

2128
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,760
you can absolutely apply and we take in

2129
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,280
a lot of interns

2130
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,840
uh and and the interns are really

2131
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,880
surprises sometimes

2132
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,000
uh a lot of them they come in and i'm

2133
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,760
like oh i'm gonna have so much to teach

2134
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,280
them oh this will be great and then they

2135
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,800
come in and i'm like

2136
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,159
well this person kind of knows

2137
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,640
everything already you know so

2138
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,159
yeah definitely um interns are

2139
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:51,440
are our way to go if you want in

2140
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,239
uh chris writes travis uh goodspeed did

2141
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:55,840
a deep talk a few years ago roughly

2142
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,360
called hillbilly tracking of lower

2143
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,880
satellites on youtube oh i will check

2144
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,159
that out

2145
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,020
um so the way um

2146
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:04,080
[Music]

2147
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,840
so the way that that we track satellites

2148
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,960
in orbit is we use something called uh

2149
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,080
uh tles or two line elements and there

2150
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,199
is

2151
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:16,640
a project for that and we'll get into

2152
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,480
that uh if we have time

2153
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,520
um but use all everything in orbit

2154
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,360
is tracked on the ground and then

2155
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,560
relayed using these

2156
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,760
uh the tle uh two line elements

2157
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,520
uh which is just a text file with two

2158
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,800
lines and a bunch of numbers

2159
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,480
and and with that you can tell where

2160
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,360
everything is um in orbit

2161
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,280
uh does my company ntt contract for nsa

2162
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,120
or noah that's a good question i do not

2163
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,719
know

2164
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,120
um

2165
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,199
yeah um i don't know off the top of my

2166
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:53,199
head i am sure there are contractors at

2167
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:54,400
the nsa

2168
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,920
and at noaa so

2169
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,679
and keep in mind that that there are

2170
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:02,719
multiple contracting companies

2171
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:06,080
um oh thank you sam uh

2172
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,719
posted a link to the travis goodspeeds

2173
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:10,560
blog on hillbilly tracking of low earth

2174
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,920
satellites

2175
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,159
um oh oh he oh this person made another

2176
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:18,880
um azimuth elevation rotator oh

2177
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:19,760
excellent

2178
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,040
yes these things are absolutely required

2179
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,640
required once you get up to a certain

2180
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,560
point in space hacking

2181
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,360
um you are going to need an azimuth

2182
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,719
elevation rotator

2183
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:34,159
to track satellites it is

2184
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:37,520
yeah it you you absolutely need one um

2185
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:40,239
like i said you just can't grab signals

2186
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:41,520
off certain satellites

2187
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,600
uh by hand tracking it's just too hard

2188
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,280
you need something that knows where it's

2189
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,120
pointing and where the satellites are

2190
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,199
um anyone want to tweak photography

2191
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,520
rotator for radio work

2192
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,920
i think that's a great idea um let me

2193
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,360
tell you actually what i'm what i'm

2194
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:57,840
using

2195
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,960
um let me switch

2196
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,080
to stop share um

2197
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,280
so one of the issues with uh

2198
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,719
with these kind of projects with the

2199
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:10,640
rotators isn't so much getting it to

2200
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,600
rotate

2201
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,280
but getting it to rotate with enough

2202
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,679
torque um

2203
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,800
these antennas weigh a good amount

2204
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,320
so if we go to for example uh servo city

2205
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,400
servo city is my robotics

2206
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,719
so i'm not paid by them i swear i'm not

2207
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:28,000
trying to sponsor them

2208
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,440
but if i needs um to build a robot i

2209
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,280
just go to servo city

2210
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,120
um and they have uh some high torque

2211
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,400
uh servos uh several gearboxes all ready

2212
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,199
to go

2213
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,560
um and this is the one i'm actually

2214
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,560
using a continuous rotation

2215
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,760
8 rpm 720 gear ratio

2216
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,239
um and so this will actually and the

2217
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,760
reason why i want to use this

2218
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,640
is because it has a saw torque of

2219
01:17:55,640 --> 01:18:00,080
2450 ounces per inch or 176.4 kilograms

2220
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,520
per centimeter

2221
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,520
or kilograms yeah kilogram centimeter um

2222
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,880
and because you need to kind of lift up

2223
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,199
these sort of heavy things that are on

2224
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,000
rods

2225
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,760
and you know it just needs to have

2226
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,679
enough torque to do it you know speed's

2227
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,360
not an issue you just have to have it

2228
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,120
have enough torque to

2229
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,400
get through gravity um

2230
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,840
but definitely anything anything that

2231
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,239
can rotate is fine and a lot of camera

2232
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:27,840
rotation equipment like you would find

2233
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:28,800
in

2234
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,920
um in hollywood is made by going to

2235
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,679
servo city and then constructing the

2236
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:34,800
equipment

2237
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,840
so absolutely let's see what do we have

2238
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,600
um do we have any other questions

2239
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,800
uh do i want to oh samus you want me to

2240
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,159
give you my twitter yes why don't i give

2241
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,440
you my twitter

2242
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,239
sam has wanted me to promote myself uh

2243
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:54,159
my twitter is caitlin guru

2244
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:57,360
um k i

2245
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,400

uniform

2250
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,679
what are my thoughts on blue origin um i

2251
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,840
have

2252
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,679
some conflicting thoughts on a lot of

2253
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:24,560
the um

2254
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,600
private first space um endeavors

2255
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,159
on the one hand i really think it's

2256
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,520
having the private industry

2257
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,920
is good for you know competition and

2258
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,440
getting things up cheaply which is one

2259
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,199
of the big

2260
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:39,040
hurdles in space is how do you get stuff

2261
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,640
into orbit cheaply and having that

2262
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,280
competition is good

2263
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,199
unfortunately for a lot of the people

2264
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,440
owning these companies and and their

2265
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,840
plans

2266
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,920
um i i don't really like how it's

2267
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,800
concentrated

2268
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,560
among uh a lot of the

2269
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,000
you know billionaire class right the

2270
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,960
elon musk of the world um

2271
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,719
you know their plans for space travel is

2272
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,080
sort of like well earth is

2273
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,480
doomed let's go to mars let me tell you

2274
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:07,920
right now you do not want to live on

2275
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:08,639
mars

2276
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:11,440
mars is terrible if if i were to tell

2277
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,639
you hey let's

2278
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,280
let's go live on the north pole you know

2279
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,800
and have no way to get back

2280
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,159
that's kind of what it's like living on

2281
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,800
mars i'm not exaggerating

2282
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,239
um it is it is not fun

2283
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:27,280
uh you know and then of course

2284
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,320
yeah you know and then of course

2285
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,760
billionaires have their own billionaire

2286
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,719
quirks and stuff

2287
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,880
anyway here's a link to my twitter i'll

2288
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,199
post in the chat

2289
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:38,239
once again k i t l y n g

2290
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:43,360
u r u um to

2291
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,000
everyone

2292
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
uh yeah let's yeah let's save earth and

2293
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,920
not not move everyone to mars

2294
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,679
um and of course the the society that

2295
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:53,760
that elon musk and everyone wants to set

2296
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,199
up on mars is

2297
01:20:55,199 --> 01:21:00,320
very much where they maintain power um

2298
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,320
uh yeah so yeah hundreds of kilograms

2299
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,679
isn't so much yeah i've been playing

2300
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:04,080
with

2301
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:07,679
some 60 kilogram uh servos

2302
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:10,080
yeah yeah it's it's not much i mean

2303
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:10,719
definitely

2304
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,880
it's not much um you need you need as

2305
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,040
much torque as you can get and

2306
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,480
you know it's hard to get get that much

2307
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,320
torque

2308
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,719
um

2309
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,760
i never thought of that yet no kings on

2310
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,679
mars yeah yeah when we

2311
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:27,760
when when it's time for humanity to

2312
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,760
start populating outside of earth

2313
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,920
um i would hope that it's more of an

2314
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,600
egalitarian effort

2315
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,719
rather than being

2316
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,520
sort of endeavored by people who have a

2317
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,520
lot to lose by egalitarianism

2318
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,560
let's just put it like that

2319
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,440
uh it might be like lord of the flies i

2320
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,600
would hope not on mars lord of the flies

2321
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,000
would be not would be even worse than

2322
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,280
nor the flies on earth

2323
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:59,120
um i mean there's just nothing there um

2324
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,360
it's it's desert let me tell you about

2325
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,520
mars

2326
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,440
mars is like i said a desert

2327
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,000
but it's not a warm desert it's a cold

2328
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,280
desert

2329
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:15,840
the earth has about

2330
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,760
75 percent more mass or something so

2331
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,000
it's a lot less gravity

2332
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,199
about 30 or 40 percent the the gravity

2333
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,239
of earth

2334
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,080
um so you're going to lose some bone

2335
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,000
density and stuff being there

2336
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,360
but what's really bad of course is

2337
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,600
there's not much of an atmosphere

2338
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,120
uh and it's not just that that the

2339
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,800
atmosphere is carbon dioxide everyone

2340
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,800
knows that there's no oxygen on mars or

2341
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,000
very little

2342
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,639
um but what makes mars really kind of

2343
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:41,840
annoying is that there's

2344
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,400
one percent of the atmosphere on earth

2345
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,199
so there's

2346
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:46,639
almost no atmosphere in fact that's why

2347
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:48,480
ingenuity was so ridiculous

2348
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,280
it's that it's almost mars is almost a

2349
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,280
vacuum and they still got ingenuity to

2350
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,960
fly and that was really cool

2351
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,639
uh but it is yeah there's almost no

2352
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,159
atmosphere um

2353
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,080
uh terraforming is just not gonna work

2354
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,440
anytime in the near future

2355
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,360
uh in the next hundred two hundred years

2356
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,440
we're not terraforming mars okay

2357
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,280
it's just it's not happening there's

2358
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,600
very little water it's a dead planet

2359
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,960
um and the most difficult thing about

2360
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,360
living on mars is that there's no

2361
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,400
magnetosphere uh the the core

2362
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,440
cooled a long time ago um so of course

2363
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,639
compasses won't work but more

2364
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:23,280
importantly

2365
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,600
there's nothing to stop radiation if you

2366
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,440
want to live on mars you gotta live

2367
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,360
underground you can't live on the

2368
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,440
surface uh there's just way too much

2369
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,639
radiation

2370
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:34,639
um you'll you'll just get it radiated

2371
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,719
and get cancer and that's not good for

2372
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:37,440
anyone so

2373
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,960
it's gonna kill you not only through the

2374
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,960
lack of of atmosphere through the lack

2375
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,159
of oxygen

2376
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,840
uh but it's also gonna irradiate you to

2377
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,239
death so yeah have fun with that uh

2378
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:49,760
some people are naysayers but elon musk

2379
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,360
is going to mars i you know i

2380
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,080
we're going to go to mars that that's

2381
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,199
for sure

2382
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,440
um it's it's just mars is not a

2383
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,280
substitute for earth

2384
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,600
it's that simple it's we're gonna go

2385
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,480
back to the moon

2386
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,239
for sure we're gonna go to mars

2387
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:08,639
but the idea of like a mars colony or

2388
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:09,840
even like a moon colony

2389
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,239
no no no we that's no

2390
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,000
um uh do you know if spacex

2391
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,760
uh became has become an elon musk crypto

2392
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,400
investment company scam too no i mean

2393
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,719
spacex is is doing things i mean it it

2394
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:30,320
their falcon um rockets really work

2395
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,639
and the way that they they land you know

2396
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,000
and save the rockets

2397
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,600
um that's really awesome i mean like i

2398
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,320
said they're doing some good work

2399
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,719
uh i mean the thing about elon musk is

2400
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,239
that he's not an inventor

2401
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:47,520
okay he's a business person he's so

2402
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,159
he's sort of like almost steve jobs kind

2403
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,360
of but not really

2404
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,960
like he's really good at marketing like

2405
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,120
of course steve wozniak created apple

2406
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,920
and steve jobs hires engineers or had

2407
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,600
when he was alive hired engineers to

2408
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,600
work on all the devices

2409
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,239
um and he just marketed them and elon

2410
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,600
musk is sort of the same way like elon

2411
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,960
musk doesn't design rockets

2412
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,679
his ideas are actually kind of dumb to

2413
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,040
be honest like

2414
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,800
not just not just his living on mars but

2415
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,719
like his transportation systems he wants

2416
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:16,800
he doesn't like people and wants like

2417
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,080
tunnels underground and stuff and no um

2418
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,920
but you know he hires good engineers

2419
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,600
right he hires good engineers at tesla

2420
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,600
he hires good engineers at spacex and

2421
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,239
they

2422
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:28,400
produce viable products okay the the

2423
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,840
tesla's a fine car

2424
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,480
it does its thing the falcon is a great

2425
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,120
rocket

2426
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,239
um and and the their newer rockets are

2427
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:37,679
going to not blow up one day

2428
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,920
and they're going to be fine so good

2429
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,840
good times

2430
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,600
um putting a bitcoin profit on the tesla

2431
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,480
profit sheet

2432
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:49,920
pump and dump yeah that's sort of yep

2433
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,560
uh tesla is trading crypto i don't know

2434
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,719
anything about that um yeah tesla's not

2435
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:55,679
a scam

2436
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:59,120
spacex is not a scam um

2437
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,440
tesla is sort of a scam lately uh they

2438
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,719
lost some money

2439
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:04,560
on the cars and made the real profits by

2440
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,159
manipulating the cryptocurrency markets

2441
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:07,440
i didn't know that

2442
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,719
yeah one of the issues of course i have

2443
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:10,719
with a lot of the cars and this would be

2444
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:13,040
a great talk for a car hacking

2445
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,320
um talk is of course that they

2446
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,320
are now putting in-app purchases in cars

2447
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,239
if you want the extra

2448
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:22,080
deluxe version of the tesla you know you

2449
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,840
pay like a subscription fee

2450
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,080
um

2451
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,679
can we have a car hacking class yeah i

2452
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,199
know someone who would be perfect for

2453
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:32,639
that for teaching that her name is

2454
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:33,360
elizabeth

2455
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:37,360
biddlecombe um and yeah hacking teslas

2456
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,320
is definitely something we should be

2457
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,199
doing

2458
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:41,360
um lots of cool stuff by the way um if

2459
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,960
you have an sdr and you get good at

2460
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:43,760
radio hacking

2461
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,719
a lot of the car unlock systems use of

2462
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:47,040
course

2463
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,159
radio communication so if you

2464
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:51,920
you know hacking satellites is a good

2465
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,159
good beginning um

2466
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:57,600
introduction to to car hacking in a way

2467
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,520
uh ad blockers on cars can't wait yeah

2468
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,400
yes exactly all right so we've kind of

2469
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,239
gone off topic here let's look back

2470
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,080
at the scoreboard let's see if anyone is

2471
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,280
playing

2472
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,920
the ctf and if we have time we can do

2473
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,239
one together

2474
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:18,480
uh let's see

2475
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,120
here we go

2476
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,080
scoreboard

2477
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,280
looks like no one is playing that's fine

2478
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,920
that's fine um we can

2479
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,000
i that just means that my talk is very

2480
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,400
interesting

2481
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,719
uh someone has been distracting them

2482
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,239
from yes someone has been subtracting

2483
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:45,199
them from the ctf yes that was me

2484
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,199
um so we can do a few of the the ctf

2485
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,719
problems together um

2486
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:54,159
let's go back to the main space hacking

2487
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,000
page okay there we go

2488
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,199
we sure are playing huh why is that

2489
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,919
not showing up

2490
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,639
huh scoreboard is not working

2491
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,239
shows up on recent points but not the

2492
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:18,239
scoreboards huh

2493
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:19,920
ah it looks like it looks like someone

2494
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,080
made a mistake um

2495
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:25,280
i should i should probably be

2496
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,400
docked pay for this

2497
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,600
i will dock my pay all right

2498
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,320
so um all right let's do let's do a few

2499
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,120
of these together

2500
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:39,199
um so let's talk about gnu radio

2501
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:42,719
gnu radio is the way of

2502
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,600
of sort of interfacing or programming

2503
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,239
sdrs

2504
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,000
using custom software so if you get a

2505
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,480
signal and you want to figure out like

2506
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,639
what it's doing

2507
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:54,480
there are two popular programs to do

2508
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,120
this one is universal radio hacker which

2509
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,239
a project will

2510
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:00,480
be coming soon but more importantly

2511
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,520
there's gnu radio

2512
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,520
and if if you had to learn one or the

2513
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,159
other i would say go with gnu radio

2514
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,840
and basically what this does is it lets

2515
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,760
you

2516
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,480
visually program your software-defined

2517
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,480
radio so if you get a signal you can

2518
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:17,679
you can tell it how to decode it um

2519
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:20,639
and so it is a difficult install on

2520
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:21,520
windows on

2521
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,600
mac or linux is pretty easy but on

2522
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,120
windows there's a there's a big

2523
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:29,520
um you have a few few options

2524
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,880
uh so i did i think yeah so today i used

2525
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:33,280
the g

2526
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,480
off installer and there are a few other

2527
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,639
installers you can use um

2528
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,679
but yeah i just downloaded gnu radio 3.8

2529
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,040
and installed that today um and let me

2530
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:45,840
boot it up

2531
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,600
uh so um

2532
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,639
should be here somewhere yeah

2533
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:55,360
you can do radio 3.8 so we're starting

2534
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,040
up canoe radio companion

2535
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,199
and this is a gui so it's really nice

2536
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:00,480
and easy to use

2537
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:04,159
um see i saw something in the chat

2538
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,920
um it may be possible for you to get

2539
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,000
hooked up here playing on some old nasa

2540
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,920
and nsa facility

2541
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,360
two meters oh nice nice yes

2542
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,239
um yeah there are a lot of places that

2543
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:18,080
um

2544
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,920
around here with a lot of dishes that i

2545
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,639
i really want to get um

2546
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,640
get hooked up with i i know um

2547
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,480
[Music]

2548
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,440
uh stanford around here has uh some

2549
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,120
really cool radio equipment for doing

2550
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,880
like moon bounce

2551
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,320
um stuff yeah i mean yeah

2552
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,560
if anyone knows any any cool resources

2553
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,800
for like big telescopes for space

2554
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,000
hacking yeah

2555
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,080
keep me keep me informed definitely

2556
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,639
always on the lookout for that

2557
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,760
um so yeah let me share

2558
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:55,040
the new radio companion up here it is

2559
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:58,560
uh good new video companion uh here we

2560
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,320
go so this is what um

2561
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,320
the new radio companion looks like uh

2562
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,239
basically you have

2563
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:08,320
uh this uh center area

2564
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:10,880
this center area here where you're going

2565
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,719
to like essentially

2566
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:16,159
draw what the radio pathway is so the

2567
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:17,040
way radio works

2568
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,560
is of course you grab a signal from an

2569
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,880
antenna so you have it like an antenna

2570
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,920
over here

2571
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,920
that comes in and then it gets processed

2572
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,280
in some way so you might like

2573
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,080
demod it

2574
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,400
you know decrypt it

2575
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,719
et cetera et cetera um through a big

2576
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:35,840
pipeline and then

2577
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,960
you get something out and we're going to

2578
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,480
sort of draw that pipeline

2579
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:44,000
in this area

2580
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,520
so if we go back to the project i know

2581
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,639
you can't see this um

2582
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,239
if we go back to the project uh we're

2583
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:51,760
going to start off by making

2584
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,120
a new a new project and we're going to

2585
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,480
go into options um

2586
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,800
so in gnu radio if you see something red

2587
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,520
like this that means something needs to

2588
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:02,800
be edited something's wrong so we're

2589
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,719
going to options and we're going to set

2590
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,239
the id to something

2591
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:09,280
new so we're going to set it to um

2592
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,480
tom we're going to make a tone generator

2593
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:16,159
id is tone and we'll go to ok

2594
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:18,880
so notice that id is no longer red and

2595
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:19,600
options

2596
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,560
is no longer red okay excellent so now

2597
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,520
we're going to

2598
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,120
create a tone in guinea radio remember

2599
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,080
when i was talking about

2600
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,159
software-defined radio and like the inq

2601
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:32,960
or mixing a sine wave with a cosine

2602
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,800
a lot of times in radio you do need to

2603
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,560
create some sort of like wave

2604
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,000
or a specific you know waveform

2605
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
so we're not even going to grab anything

2606
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,040
from the radio right now we're just

2607
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,440
going to

2608
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,520
create a tone so to do this we're going

2609
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,000
to go over to waveform generators

2610
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,199
over the right side here

2611
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:58,400
and any radio has

2612
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:08,159
frozen on me

2613
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:12,719
uh blue no

2614
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,040
let me stop sharing maybe i'll fix it

2615
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,639
yes that fixed it okay so sharing

2616
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:21,199
apparently makes it not work

2617
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:24,960
that's interesting okay um

2618
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,080
all right so we go to waveform

2619
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,000
generation and we're gonna go to a

2620
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,239
signal source

2621
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:33,440
and just drag that on oops

2622
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:37,679
drag it there we go double click

2623
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,719
awesome awesome possum so we're going to

2624
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:42,719
double click on the signal source

2625
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,000
we're going to set it to what we want it

2626
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,560
to be um complex

2627
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,480
output once again think of complex as iq

2628
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,159
we don't want iq out we want just a

2629
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:55,199
simple floating point sine wave

2630
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:58,480
keep it simple and a frequency

2631
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:03,840
of um like middle c like 261

2632
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,520
hertz we'll say

2633
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:12,400
yeah cosine float yep um

2634
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:16,639
okay there we go um

2635
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:21,120
it's still red why is it red um

2636
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,280
because i didn't set stamp rate

2637
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,960
no i did set it to 3200

2638
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,719
maybe because nothing's coming out um

2639
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,239
all right and we'll need an audio sync

2640
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,639
oops let's see

2641
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,040
poor's not connected yes chris got it

2642
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,320
right i don't have a connect to anything

2643
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:43,760
that's white red

2644
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,880
uh so we'll need an audio sync um

2645
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,000
um let me once again stop the share so i

2646
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:50,480
can

2647
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:54,959
use it sorry about this um

2648
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,560
core audio audio sync there we go

2649
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,840
now i'll share again

2650
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,159
all right so now we have an audio sync

2651
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:11,040
and a signal source

2652
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,679
and we just drag from the output to the

2653
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:15,840
input of the audio sync

2654
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:19,040
and if we run it we'll get

2655
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,159
a tone out so well

2656
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,400
we have to save it first so i'll save it

2657
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:29,839
on my desktop

2658
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:42,159
warning missing x term executable okay

2659
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:47,119
there we go ah anyway we get a tone out

2660
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:50,480
um and i have no idea how to stop it at

2661
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,159
this point run

2662
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:55,119
kill there we go uh so yeah so we

2663
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:56,800
managed to successfully create a tone

2664
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,320
uh using the new radio using these

2665
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,080
blocks so as you can see there's

2666
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,000
there's no programming required

2667
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,320
necessarily however i will say under the

2668
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,280
hood

2669
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,119
what it's doing is it's creating a

2670
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:08,719
python script

2671
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:10,880
using what we draw on the screen so if

2672
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,400
there is more complicated programming

2673
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,239
that's necessary

2674
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:17,280
um oh i see chris is an expert clicking

2675
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,400
on the port will connect them you don't

2676
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,840
need to drag the wire yes

2677
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,840
yes you can do that as well so if you

2678
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,119
click

2679
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:27,840
you can connect them together just like

2680
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,360
that

2681
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,159
um and of course you know we heard it

2682
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:33,360
but

2683
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,560
when you're working with radio it's

2684
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,760
sometimes nice to have a visual

2685
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:37,040
representation

2686
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:40,719
of what's happening so we can add a

2687
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:43,920
qt time sync which will give us a nice

2688
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,239
graph

2689
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,560
what's being put out to the audio

2690
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,280
let's stop the share once again so i can

2691
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,080
use the

2692
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,800
side panel um so that is an

2693
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,159
instrumentation

2694
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:02,320
uh let's see core instrumentation

2695
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,960
qt of course qt for people that don't

2696
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,320
know qut is a standard gui library

2697
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:11,679
uh qt time sync

2698
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:15,440
there we go uh we'll say type

2699
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,360
let's actually go back to sharing now

2700
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:21,839
that now that's in

2701
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:27,440
let's just we're sharing i have oh there

2702
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,678
we go

2703
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,360
uh so we have a time sink here we'll set

2704
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,080
the

2705
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,840
input to float and set the output to the

2706
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:38,800
input here

2707
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,480
and now when we run it not only should

2708
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,480
we hear the audio signal

2709
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:49,839
we should see it

2710
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:53,280
there we go uh oh there we go now we can

2711
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,400
actually see the waveform

2712
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,480
now and we can close it um and

2713
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,639
uh yeah and so the rest of this project

2714
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:06,800
let me switch back to once again

2715
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,679
back to the web browser

2716
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:15,280
share web browser

2717
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:17,600
uh and so in the rest of this project uh

2718
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,119
you actually create a scroll bar and

2719
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,719
you'll be able to change the frequency

2720
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,560
that's being generated

2721
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,280
um and you will end up with something

2722
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,719
like this where you have a sine wave

2723
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:28,400
generation

2724
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,159
and you can control the tone and the

2725
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:31,440
frequency

2726
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,119
and like i said underneath the hood what

2727
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:34,800
it's doing is it's actually creating a

2728
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:35,920
python

2729
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,719
uh script uh that you can edit and that

2730
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,080
can be really useful too because you can

2731
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,239
create the the basic framework

2732
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,480
for how you're going to decode this the

2733
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,400
signal and then edit the

2734
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,360
the python that that comes out all right

2735
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,520
i just noticed it's

2736
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:59,840
401 any any more questions

2737
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,440
um so yeah like i said gnu radio is

2738
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,840
you're one of the go-to pieces of

2739
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:06,880
software for

2740
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,880
um hacking satellites if you do not have

2741
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,280
a piece of software that will decode

2742
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,760
your the what's coming off the satellite

2743
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:14,800
for you

2744
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,560
gnu radio is usually going to be your

2745
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,159
first first step

2746
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:27,119
that's getting that working

2747
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:30,800
all right um well it is four o'clock um

2748
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,199
i do want to point out i i realize that

2749
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:34,400
i've spent all this time talking about

2750
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,320
sdrs i never showed you one

2751
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,320
uh this is what one of them looks like

2752
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,480
it's just a little usb device

2753
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:44,560
20 bucks on amazon your antenna goes on

2754
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,159
sorry about the green screen the antenna

2755
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,600
goes on this end

2756
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,280
and of course usb goes on the other end

2757
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:53,679
thank you very much that was an

2758
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:55,280
incredible presentation

2759
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,639
um any other questions

2760
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,400
okay um yeah and oh before i go let me

2761
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,000
give you a pro tip

2762
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,199
um if you get into using a lot of sdr

2763
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:12,719
stuff

2764
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:15,600
um i mentioned the antenna that's of

2765
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:15,920
course

2766
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,639
very important but you also want

2767
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:19,520
something called

2768
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:23,760
a low noise amplifier

2769
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,639
and you also want to have a filter those

2770
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:27,600
are going to help you a lot

2771
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,560
just a pro tip if you're having issues

2772
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:34,000
amplifier and filter

2773
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:37,199
and you can actually go on to amazon

2774
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:40,400
and get uh like two-on-ones

2775
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,960
like this that is a this one is

2776
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,239
specifically for

2777
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:47,600
uh noaa satellites it's a low uh

2778
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,800
it's a low noise amplifier and a

2779
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,040
filter in in one so it'll filter out

2780
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,400
anything else that's not

2781
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:57,679
within the you know normal noaa 137

2782
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:58,800
megahertz

2783
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:05,840
and also amplify the simple

2784
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:09,600
oh we have east coast members awesome

2785
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,040
thank you for for coming all the way

2786
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,920
from the east coast

2787
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,679
we have people from everywhere here you

2788
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,040
there alexa yeah

2789
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,840
hope to see you soon in person uh in san

2790
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,440
jose

2791
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,360
absolutely like i said i just moved to

2792
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,800
sunnyvale um

2793
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,520
so i'm gonna be joining pacific hackers

2794
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,199
it's nice to meet everyone

2795
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:29,600
absolutely thank you very much again and

2796
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,280
thanks everybody do you have

2797
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,960
we have a discord uh that i can actually

2798
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:35,920
publish the

2799
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,159
invitation here if you guys want to join

2800
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,040
it

2801
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,600
uh here's where we usually coordinate

2802
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,719
about meetings

2803
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:46,719
and um we're now coordinating about

2804
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:49,199
uh what we're going to do at defcon i

2805
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:51,199
was talking to sam about it

2806
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:54,480
uh when we started the the meeting and

2807
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,239
uh thanks sam

2808
01:41:56,239 --> 01:41:59,840
uh for hooking us up with uh kathleen

2809
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,040
this is awesome and

2810
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,040
uh hopefully we'll continue bringing

2811
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,320
this uh excellent

2812
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,400
content and uh thank you everybody for

2813
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,719
joining

2814
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:13,280
great so someone asked if the talk will

2815
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,480
be available later

2816
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,400
uh absolutely it was being recorded by

2817
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,320
two people actually so

2818
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,760
yeah i know we went over a lot it's a

2819
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,360
lot to go over um

2820
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:24,000
but this is really the the base

2821
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,920
information that you really need

2822
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,920
to to get into space hacking and like i

2823
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,600
said most most of this

2824
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,560
is just understanding what the radio is

2825
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,199
doing

2826
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:36,600
because of course that's how you

2827
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,600
communicate
