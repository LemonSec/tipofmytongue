doing kind of the technical presentation

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,600
so i'm just going to do a really

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,079
quick high level overview

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,920
and so

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
far they pretty much we started as a

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
consultant consultancy company kind of

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
the whole gauntlet of offensive security

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,960
services

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,000
um you know pen testing volume

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,200
assessments red team services code

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,640
review

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,680
and

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,840
you know on-site stuff when when they

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,560
let us sometimes we like to break things

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,080
there'll be a research branch of the

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,439
company as well so you know we're

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,280
looking for zero days

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,360
and trying to kind of be on the cutting

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,640
edge you know what's happening in the

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,400
industry and everything

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,880
pre covered we were black we've been

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,040
black blackhead sponsors for five years

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,720
so we're going to all those events for

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,320
global sponsors

48
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,799
before the pandemic hit um

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,520
and we we organized our own event in

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,399
argentina called echo party which is

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,799
really cool so if you guys can ever make

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,520
it down there highly recommended

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,799
um

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,040
so we originally started making faraday

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,960
for our team internally

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,920
in

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
you know we hated writing reports so we

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,160
wanted something to help with that we've

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
developed it a lot since then

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,380
um

61
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,280
[Music]

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,720
because we kind of realized there's a

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
gap in the market for something like

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
this so pretty much faraday is a

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,720
platform for collaborative penetration

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,360
testing and vulnerability management

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,680
and the idea is to be you know really

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,360
flexible with your tooling we have more

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,239
than

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,239
80 supported plug-ins

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,640
and a lot of open source stuff a lot of

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,400
commercial stuff kind of the more to the

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,599
barrier

74
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,640
and

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,840
get all your outputs from all those

76
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,360
different tools your scanners or

77
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
whatever your manual stuff into faraday

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,120
in standardize centralize the

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,480
information

80
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,800
a you know kind of be able to sort of

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,440
prioritize you know what's happening for

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
a specific project and everything

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,560
um

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
and

85
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,360
then help automate different pain points

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
whether that be you know report

87
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,239
generation

88
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,159
um different parts of the vulnerability

89
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,319
management process

90
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,879
um

91
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,480
you know kicking off sort of routine

92
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,760
scans

93
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
and pretty much the ideas you know sort

94
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,519
of to make your guys lives easier

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,400
um okay so now it's time for the demo

okay i think he only allowed me to

108
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,519
present tabs

109
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,519

[Music]

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,360
window if that's what you want to show

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,520
us

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,040
yes

120
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,479
okay good

121
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,479
uh

122
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,960
all right let me start with the

123
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,199
introduction this is uh

124
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,120
i'm just running in local instance of

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,400
pharah in

126
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,639
my machine but this is the

127
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,520
gui gui which is a web

128
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,560
interface

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
so let me

130
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,600
let me log in

131
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,160
okay

132
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,600
so far has has the concept of call we

133
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,160
call workspace so i create a bunch of

134
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,080
workspace already

135
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,440
so let me create another one

136
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,639
let's create another one

137
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,800
let's call it

138
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,039
maybe

139
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,000
you could use define an end date

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
the users that allow it to see the

141
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,080
workspace scope and if you want to make

142
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,639
it public a description a few details if

143
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
you want to

144
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
and then you select actually the

145
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,560
workspace you want to work on

146
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,919
right

147
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,440
as you can see this works they're all

148
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,960
empty actually

149
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
so before we start

150
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,440
let me run

151
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,560
because this is going to take time

152
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,360
i probably can't see the screen

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,440
can you see this screen

154
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,319
yeah or

155
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,759
can you see

156
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,639
burp no

157
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,240
yes yes we can see the the well no no it

158
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,479
just went away sorry

159
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,880
sorry it i i saw it but then it just

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,840
disappeared

161
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,360
okay let me see if you can see it now

162
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
again

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,720
yes

164
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,840
yeah

165
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,560
okay great um i'm pretty sure that

166
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
everyone is aware workpiece tool for

167
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,520
it's a proxy for audit and it's very

168
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,240
popular so what we did here to integrate

169
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,319
group into faraday

170
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,479
is something called group extenders

171
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,240
which are extensions that you can add so

172
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,840
we create a client in java

173
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,638
let me say

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,759
where is it

175
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,560
there you go so let me first of all add

176
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,800
this it's an extension you can add into

177
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,160
burp

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,840
and now you will have a town called

179
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,520
valdez at the end

180
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,160
and then you can

181
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,880
connect to it

182
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,120
and of course i need to login

183
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,720
and says yourself login and you can

184
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,000
select the book and also a workspace

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
and you can also select if you want to

186
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,599
how to import vulnerabilities or do it

187
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
manually

188
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
that aside

189
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,319
this is an empty group so what i'm going

190
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,639
to do

191
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,720
you still see the screen right just let

192
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,919
me know when you don't see the screen

193
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,840
so because this takes time i'm going to

194
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,638
run an agent

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
before i know i will explain you

196
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
something later but for now i need to

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,840
run

198
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,520
it so let me run it because it takes

199
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,840
time

200
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,199
oh it lost the window

201
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,080
there you go

202
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,960
okay

203
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,919
going back so i have a

204
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,840
completely empty dashboard so i'm going

205
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,879
to do now

206
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
i got the option of

207
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,440
creating workspace

208
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
adding vulnerabilities to into the

209
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,879
workspace

210
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,800
the way we do this and assets and

211
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,479
credentials we're still watching the

212
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,080
verb

213
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,199
okay

214
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,360
how do i change that you may have to

215
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,958
yeah

216
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,719
uh share

217
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,719
richard

218
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,120
okay now

219
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
are we good yeah yeah great

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
okay

221
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,519
so

222
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,680
we have the ability to actually import

223
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,920
vulnerabilities from different tools

224
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,720
like

225
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,160
nessus or

226
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
different scanners or manual

227
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,519
vulnerabilities

228
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,640
so this is a multi-user as well so we

229
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,959
can have multiple users in this case we

230
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,040
have two users one is an administrator

231
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,519
there is in different roles

232
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,120
so let me go up and then select the file

233
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,920
i'm going to

234
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,599
import

235
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,360
nss scan which is uh yeah this is and

236
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,880
upload the file

237
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,200
this is a done manually i'm showing you

238
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,120
here through the gui then we will move

239
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,080
into the cli and automation part

240
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,480
but just so you you'll see that the

241
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
vulnerabilities count start to go up

242
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
because it's importing all the nessus

243
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,240
munabilities we just

244
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,200
give the report

245
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,120
and this is start to get populated a bit

246
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,839
more with color

247
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,760
246 if i refresh

248
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,839
i should have around 300 i believe

249
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,399
yeah 333

250
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,480
okay so the main dashboard will give you

251
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,200
what these latest variabilities calls

252
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,279
services

253
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,399
activity feeds and history commands what

254
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,079
has been done in this particular

255
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,320
workspace

256
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,040
and if i move into the manage part

257
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,839
you can remove columns

258
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,519
and you know and otherwise the

259
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,320
sensibility

260
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
oh you can also

261
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,959
put confirm and confirm there's a lot of

262
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,560
features that you can actually add and

263
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,160
remove columns

264
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,640
and play with it

265
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,839
and

266
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,680
if you go to the host part you will see

267
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,839
that the assets you have and how many

268
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,079
services each has and vulnerabilities

269
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,320
each has and you can put descriptions

270
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,640
and let's show and search

271
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,839
some

272
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,320
information credentials also allow you

273
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,120
to

274
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,360
actually input credentials to share with

275
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,720
your team

276
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,399
right so this is kind of a quick

277
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,760
overview how they

278
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,000
for example you can group aggregate them

279
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,560
by severity if you want to

280
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
right

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,480
let me put this in all

282
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
pages

283
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,120
so

284
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,200
and you can expand if you want to these

285
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,959
are the criticals and

286
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,680
so you basically play a lot with your

287
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,560
vulnerabilities that you import now we

288
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,040
did the nexus right so the good thing

289
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,519
about this is we don't we are agnostic

290
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,720
so

291
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
if i go and add

292
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,600
let's say an open bus report on top of

293
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,040
the nexus that i already have

294
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
from our point of view we don't really

295
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,200
care where it will come from open bars

296
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,120
nessus qualities netsuppose nmap

297
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,279
we just imported and treated the same

298
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,600
the only difference will be that your

299
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,399
tool

300
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,399
id will be slightly different because

301
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,160
it's a different tool

302
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,079
let me see if i can order

303
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,079
might be the way around you see two like

304
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,320
this where the will come the this

305
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
information come from

306
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
if you click on it you will see the

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,399
description technicals you can change

308
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,920
the fix you can re change the severity

309
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,600
you can confirm

310
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
you can do a lot of stuff attach

311
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,360
screenshot technical details

312
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
custom fields

313
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
and comments

314
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,440
comments is a

315
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,680
useful feature for multi-users when the

316
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,639
people

317
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,000
working on

318
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
using the bully reality management or

319
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,279
the pen testing itself so allow us to

320
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,720
have to leave some

321
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,880
comments or message between users

322
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,040
for example

323
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,079
on

324
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,600
this one

325
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,639
i can leave a comment here at john

326
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,839
and i changed the accessibility to

327
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,160
critical actually and confirmed this

328
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
university because i'm sure it is and

329
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,720
it's simple to fix

330
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,200
i did all that no and leave a comment

331
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,800
now if i go low out

332
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,880
yeah i mean says john

333
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,240
all right uh

334
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,560
i think it was nessus

335
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,600
yeah

336
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,079
so you can see here that i say one

337
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,920
notification that's because someone

338
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,360
leave a comment

339
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,120
to me with the ad

340
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,920
so if i go click on it and i can see the

341
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,200
comments that

342
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
someone leaves to me and so it's allow

343
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
me to have an interact between teams

344
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,240
mainly when people is offline

345
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,800
online or different locations so that's

346
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,399
quite cool feature of course the

347
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,839
searching and

348
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,839
playing with the editing and bull

349
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,120
creation et cetera

350
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,519
so we also have the cool part which is

351
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,240
the reporting

352
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,079
um so the report inside we can create a

353
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,160
report so

354
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,120
i can just

355
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,040
i can choose a template

356
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,480
right so for example this is a

357
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,480
generic template that we provide you can

358
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,279
customize the templates basically doc

359
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,959
x format

360
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,518
and you can

361
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,040
i can put details and

362
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
all right

363
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,279
then you can scope

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,160
and you can also do the cool piles you

365
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,639
can also put filters which is on the tie

366
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,720
inside or severity and

367
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,320
maybe you don't want to report on the

368
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,959
300 so we don't do on the criticals and

369
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,959
the highs

370
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,519
for example

371
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
oh and i was john sorry

372
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,120
i did a lot and i was not john is just a

373
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,720
read-only user he's not there

374
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,230
maybe

375
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,839
[Music]

376
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,160
there you go

377
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
i'm not going to create and i'm going to

378
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,839
do going to put the critical in the

379
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,160
heist

380
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
this should open

381
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,079
this is going to be probably open maybe

382
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,880
in a different tab

383
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,279
let me see if i

384
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,320
can you guys see this oh maybe yeah

385
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,240
right so this is how

386
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,320
this we also chose

387
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,720
all the details we go here and

388
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
you know you can customize whatever you

389
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,639
want and we also decide to report on

390
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,480
criticals and

391
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,240
high only right

392
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
and it will give you all the details of

393
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
each vulnerability so this is a way to

394
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,120
automate

395
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,000
reporting and pen testing

396
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,839
okay so we also have new

397
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,759
features so for example i will go to

398
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,800
november nice a new dashboard

399
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,360
a workspace desk has nothing on it

400
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,560
so let me do let me show you how the

401
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,600
features

402
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,519
let's do a smallness import

403
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,320
and also

404
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,000
operations

405
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,959
so in operation no this is feature is in

406
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,399
settings

407
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,680
we have something called workflows

408
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,519
in october

409
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,959
so workflows allow me to select specific

410
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,639
details and

411
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,240
take an action on it

412
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,759
so for example

413
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,000
let's go to vulnerabilities and i have

414
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,320
let's just bring this let's use things

415
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,839
scanner

416
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,560
what i want to do

417
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,240
if i

418
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
copy this and i click on it

419
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,680
yeah

420
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,399
click you know

421
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
let me

422
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,759
let's go rid of that ones for close so i

423
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,800
can make a workflow

424
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,720
for october so when there's a

425
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,199
vulnerability and the name

426
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,839
is equal

427
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,359
to sync scanner

428
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,280
then the action will be i already have

429
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,480
defining action called delete

430
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,679
save action

431
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,640
and create the workflow right

432
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
and this is active on the workspace so

433
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,880
what this does is allow me to create a

434
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,199
specific workflow for actions

435
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,439
so when i import data when i have data

436
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,480
on it

437
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,240
all the abilities

438
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,799
we in this case we will actually delete

439
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,840
those things right

440
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,400
so

441
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,039
let me reimport

442
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,679
and actually

443
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
refresh it

444
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,559
yeah i have them here so i have 35

445
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,959
this will kick on

446
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,440
press it

447
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,160
let's import it

448
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,880
oh october

449
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,120
sorry we created in october so november

450
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,640
we didn't touch it right

451
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,360
so

452
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,559
let me go to october

453
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,760
there you go

454
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
so i'm putting november and october the

455
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,799
two reports exactly the same files

456
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,160
though so they should have the same

457
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,559
amount of vulnerabilities

458
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,720
geos35 i think

459
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,440
one report

460
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,080
there you go here we can see

461
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,240
that when it found the condition scanner

462
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,640
it will delete the object so this is all

463
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,520
the rules matching

464
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,960
so i only have 11 left so now

465
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,280
i can do

466
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,400
in

467
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
inside

468
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,760
i can show something called workspace

469
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,160
comparison which i can compare to

470
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,720
workspace

471
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,360
and this will give me information about

472
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,160
for example if i run every month uh

473
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
scanners on the vulnerability management

474
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,679
i will see the difference of what

475
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,520
happened and what did not happen between

476
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,799
the month

477
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,280
amounts

478
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,039
details on this ports and servers

479
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,039
the host in this case is only one host

480
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,760
so this is kind of how the mainly the

481
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,080
gui works

482
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,840
also for example

483
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,880
if i go to a bullet ability particularly

484
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,919
i don't know this one

485
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,039
let me it did it

486
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,280
this

487
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,080
and i one

488
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,280
do it

489
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,200
right i can actually have something

490
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,960
called knowledge space where i can put

491
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,559
my own details about vulnerabilities

492
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,000
so

493
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
if i

494
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,039
close this yes

495
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,760
this is if i mark it and click here

496
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,320
create temple what this is going to do

497
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,919
is from this vulnerability it's going to

498
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,440
create a temple

499
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,880
so now if i go to knowledge space

500
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,600
i have a temple i think was this one

501
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,440
which i can actually modify and put

502
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
my own

503
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,880
this is

504
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,960
high

505
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,600
i can put more explanation i can put

506
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,200
moderate i can actually put different

507
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,120
language if i want to i can change the

508
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,799
details

509
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,080
i can add reference

510
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,799
i can add

511
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,760
policy creations custom fields

512
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
details on it

513
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,239
then what i'm going to do

514
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,000
is spanish as well

515
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,919
so now i have that temple

516
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,000
so for example if i found a reliability

517
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,039
let's say

518
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,120
i know this one

519
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
right

520
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,520
let me change it

521
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,400
my mouse is

522
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,440
if i edit this vulnerability

523
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,000
i can actually this is ssh server type

524
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,320
blah blah blah so i can look for my

525
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
search in my temple

526
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
and i can automatically replace with all

527
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,960
the information that i put on it

528
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,760
so if i click ok that gives rename it to

529
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,840
whatever my template say it was this one

530
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,559
this one actually

531
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,520
yeah

532
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,559
so this is one way to do it

533
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,520
so

534
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
this is pretty much

535
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,200
all there let me see if

536
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
anything else i want to show you guys

537
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,960
okay so this is pretty much the only

538
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,600
gooey part one more thing is let's go

539
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,639
back to the bulbs thing

540
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,960
poop

541
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
i was empty

542
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,200
we're still running

543
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,280
what this is going i have a question

544
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,200
this is great uh thank you for showing

545
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,320
us this can you do maps can you do like

546
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,960
a grippable or xml export and then

547
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,120
import it

548
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,840
for example let me go to

549
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,039
this empty workspace

550
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,480
when you

551
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,000
i don't have an end map we do one now

552
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,480
let's generate a report

553
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,440
map

554
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,120
uh let me show you in the gui in the in

555
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,440
the cli you will be easy for the map but

556
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,400
yes you can import uh nmaps directly

557
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,480
files xmls from map and different tools

558
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,039
jsons and xml some of them for example

559
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,640
open

560
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,039
sap actually it's an xml some of them

561
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,080
are open buses in xml

562
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,520
new clay is a json or naboo is a json so

563
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,039
dependent tool in case of mmap is an xml

564
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,000
as well

565
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,840
so dependent tool you can

566
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,720
import the format that will provide you

567
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
but also you can export

568
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,960
and when you this is your

569
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
for example your

570
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,080
uh workspace this is a for importing but

571
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,039
this is to export into csv

572
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,039
so this will generate the csv of the

573
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,400
columns you

574
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,440
decide to put or not to put actually

575
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,159
you can add columns here's or not and

576
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,960
whatever the columns are you displaying

577
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,679
are the ones you can export into a csv

578
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,559
file

579
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,640
if let's say if you want to play and put

580
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,360
with something else

581
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,799
i said

582
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,840
let's say uh answer your question

583
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,120
uh yeah um we do have

584
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,360
um

585
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,120
jim uh

586
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,799
can the report

587
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,600
be created automatically

588
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,520
on

589
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
yeah go on

590
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,039
like like

591
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,279
to me

592
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,039
thank you the question is can the

593
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,440
executive summary the part that you want

594
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,520
the people that make decisions and don't

595
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,120
have a lot of time to read the entire

596
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,400
report read

597
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,520
can that ever be authored

598
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,960
programmatically because i've been

599
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,159
looking at gp t3 and all the trillion

600
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
parameter models that they've been

601
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,000
trying to do to get generative i don't

602
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,159
think they're anywhere near i don't

603
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,080
think they will be anywhere near until

604
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,600
we have like

605
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,559
um

606
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,960
millions of kilobytes of uh quantum ram

607
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
and right now we don't even have a

608
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
single bit of quantum ram

609
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,400
so my question is

610
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,360
uh would you always want to have a

611
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,400
person

612
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,720
a an individual person or perhaps a

613
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,520
person in their editor you know maybe a

614
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,200
larger group i don't know

615
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,080
uh

616
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,400
authoring the executive summary

617
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
or do you believe that someday you will

618
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
be able to make a computer program that

619
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,640
can write a correct and informative uh

620
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,480
executive summary for a pen testing

621
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,720
report

622
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,840
okay that's a very good question uh

623
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,760
the way that the we are i'm showing you

624
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,480
the degree right in the gui yes this is

625
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,520
humans interaction mainly you actually

626
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,240
write this stuff

627
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,840
manually what you can do is uh automate

628
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,080
that writing but you do need to have a

629
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,240
template of what what you want to write

630
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,200
on it

631
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,080
like

632
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,320
the are the all the pen tests those

633
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,720
reports are going to be the same summary

634
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,799
if that's the case or maybe some tags

635
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,279
they can replace some logic into it you

636
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,039
can definitely script it that because we

637
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,720
provide you a cli which i'm going to

638
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,760
show you now

639
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,919
that allow you to generate reports

640
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,360
through the cli

641
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,400
so that summary is

642
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,880
most likely a

643
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,840
it's a

644
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,000
oh if you correct me if i'm

645
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,760
please may i follow up correct me if i'm

646
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,200
wrong but you showed

647
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,400
three

648
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,279
text areas a form with three text areas

649
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,919
that would define the executive summary

650
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,400
and i think that that um

651
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
uh yeah

652
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,279
there they are i'm gonna take a

653
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,039
screenshot of those so i can refer to

654
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,559
them later if need be

655
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,880
but um summary

656
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,919
conclusions and recommendations those

657
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,640
are

658
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,039
extremely important categories

659
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,000
but

660
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,960
filling filling them out i think if we

661
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,120
ever turn over the responsibility of

662
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,799
filling those out for pen testing

663
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,799
reports or any other kind of security

664
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,880
based

665
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,559
you know cyber security or

666
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,559
cybernetics kinds of recommendations

667
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,559
i think without a person

668
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,159
proofreading them to make sure that they

669
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,240
don't say something terrible like let's

670
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,640
maximize the number of paper clips

671
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
you know that's something that we want

672
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,400
to prevent and if we write a program

673
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,840
that we believe

674
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840
can fill those fields out maybe from

675
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,080
templates or boilerplate or whatever

676
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
we still have to

677
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
we have to guard against the possibility

678
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,400
that it might say that someday a bug

679
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,080
might occur and it might say let's

680
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,320
maximize the number of paper clips and

681
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,799
and it would wreck the economy

682
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,440
yes i completely agree it shouldn't be

683
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
the pentester works too

684
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,520
that's the reason we have a

685
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
template

686
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,799
field but these are come with the box

687
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,960
but you can customize whatever you want

688
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,559
so i will show you how these templates

689
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,559
look

690
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,240
one second

691
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
this is

692
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,760
uh probably you can see right

693
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,879
let me reshare this

694
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,799
no can you see my screen

695
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,840
not

696
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,520
yet not yet

697
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,320
which one is it

698
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
 again

699
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,360
i don't know why

700
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,480
maybe your client is all right

701
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,039
i have another question

702
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,640
can you see the entire screen

703
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
uh

704
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,600
there's some some black screen i'm not

705
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
sure if that's yeah

706
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,240
oh this is a problem because i can't

707
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,919
really share your screen

708
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,000
oh this is going to be

709
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,880
a hard one

710
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,799
well i i think the question answers

711
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,440
itself you know it's just obvious that

712
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,679
if you write a program whether it's a

713
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,679
single template or a sophisticated

714
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,039
program involving the idea of templates

715
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,279
with string processing operations of any

716
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,159
sort

717
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,039
then

718
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,799
you know even if it is a trillion

719
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,360
parameter model like gpt 3 plus plus

720
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,960
plus plus it's not going to be able to

721
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,159
defend against the kinds of failures

722
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,480
which would be equivalent to saying

723
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,320
let's make as many paper clips as we

724
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,840
possibly can

725
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,559
so

726
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,440
i

727
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,600
my question is answered i i'm sorry i

728
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,320
was uh so verbose but it seems like it's

729
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,080
obvious in retrospect but there's always

730
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,799
20 20 hindsight thank you so much

731
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,960
yeah definitely i will show you

732
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
we can do work on it i think it's a very

733
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,039
valid question we

734
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,360
we wouldn't allow the pen test to write

735
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,279
that summary or

736
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,000
or manually due to many things

737
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,039
but uh yeah so and i have another

738
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,159
question

739
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,080
yeah and you probably get a lot of

740
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,120
questions about it my turn

741
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,679
do you have it you have mapping for

742
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,799
micro tdps

743
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,399
uh

744
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,559
like

745
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,760
with the tool

746
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,960
yeah

747
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,720
yeah we don't

748
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,799
in them

749
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,520
the information we we let me go back to

750
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,840
the window where is it i think it's this

751
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,360
one

752
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,240
okay

753
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,520
yeah

754
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,200
remember the vulnerabilities that are

755
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,159
coming are coming from a tool not from

756
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,640
ourselves right so those details yeah

757
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,000
you're right okay

758
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,320
if this tool does provide you that

759
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,559
information yes we would put we put it

760
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,399
here

761
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,919
and you can also add your own custom

762
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,760
fields that i don't know

763
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,799
specific from miter right or you can do

764
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,080
here

765
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,240
right if the tool doesn't have it that

766
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,399
information we don't

767
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,720
invent it in a way right

768
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,520
so

769
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
so let's let's assume you have it's

770
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,360
necessary if nessus did not add any csb

771
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,760
on it or

772
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,200
cbe on it

773
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,760
we don't really have a pragmatic way to

774
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,240
map this vulnerability from nesus name

775
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,080
which is called

776
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,639
that thing

777
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,320
to a specific cve unless they do provide

778
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,918
us with a cv number or

779
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,760
yes exactly if we get the metadata we

780
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
can display it that's okay and we can

781
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,159
report on it but

782
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,240
we can generate it from because you can

783
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,000
create your own vulnerability manually i

784
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,399
mean like write whatever you want

785
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,159
you go and create the bullet

786
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,080
you choose a host and you choose your

787
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,120
own

788
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,679
general descriptions and so

789
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,279
we are flexible and allowing you to

790
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,880
write whatever you want

791
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,960
but also we need to import the tools

792
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,519
that the there can already exist

793
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,640
it's form so

794
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,720
there's a way to automate for example

795
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,799
some mapping on it

796
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,799
if you have some details metadata like

797
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,200
cv if you have cve there's a way that we

798
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,240
can do to automate and bring the cvs

799
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
details from a

800
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,559
mvd for example

801
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,799
right things like that it is flexible

802
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,240
that we can script it and automate it

803
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,919
that's that's pretty cool man thank you

804
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,840
very much um

805
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,760
and then can i just say

806
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,240
did i just say when i when i said

807
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,480
uh that a system an automatic system

808
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,080
might recommend making a lot of paper

809
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,440
clips that's um

810
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
that's a technical

811
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,480
uh

812
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,039
term from the control problem

813
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,960
peer-reviewed literature

814
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,960
what it means is that sometimes ai

815
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,440
systems or you know

816
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,919
microsoft word macros whatever can

817
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,799
recommend things that are really bad

818
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,080
and we need to be on guard all of us in

819
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,760
this industry whether we're black hats

820
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,240
white house gray hats whatever you know

821
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,679
we need to make sure that we're not

822
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,519
destroying everybody at the same time

823
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,240
right

824
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,760
i completely agree on that

825
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,279
let's see different ways to tackle the

826
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,559
problem

827
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,720
we will be looking into

828
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,960
all sort of way to try to solve

829
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,559
everyone's problems

830
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,120
and we actually really appreciate all

831
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,679
the feedback we get so this tool grow

832
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,519
ups in

833
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,519
from the industry itself every time we

834
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,840
show this in many many conferences we

835
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,440
get graph the feedback from people and

836
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,519
we work on those features so either

837
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,519
useful or not useful features that

838
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,640
people use

839
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,200
and so every every single question that

840
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,960
you have is very

841
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,279
valid and useful to us because our use

842
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,840
case that how people use a tool we

843
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,679
discovered this tool was designed to be

844
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,799
a

845
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,880
pentest report and people started to use

846
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,120
this tool as a vulnerability management

847
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,399
and then people thank you as an

848
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,000
orchestration

849
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,760
thank you kindly and thank you so much

850
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,840
for showing your software it's really

851
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,360
interesting and i hope to be able to run

852
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,840
it soon

853
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,679
yes give me one talking about that how

854
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,840
would you get this software

855
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,720
is the stairway is it trial where what

856
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,120
what do we need to do

857
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,960
okay so let me

858
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,599
so we release

859
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,918
i think it was last week this week just

860
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,079
made no more than me

let me see if you can

872
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,800
perhaps you could just post your uh repo

873
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,679
link to the chat

874
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,199

joining in a different

878
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,760
computer

879
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,839
so

880
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
we have a

881
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,920
where is the chat name there you go

882
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,960
here

883
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,640
i just made your presenter on the second

884
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,119
computer so you can you can share from

885
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,440
there

886
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,000
okay great

887
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,280
let's see

888
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,800
this one

889
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,320
you see you can hear the screen

890
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,720
yes okay

891
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,920
so

892
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,880
i think it should be a whole screen

893
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,880
yeah

894
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,439
and this will be

895
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,040
if you go to our website

896
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,680

897
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,800

898
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,119
we have the

899

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,440
this will be

901
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,119
this is our github where you get the

902
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,839
community version right

903
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,320
um this installation process and a lot

904
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,760
of documentation

905
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,599
but we released last week

906
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,040
version 4

907
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,480
version four what it has is a

908
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,440
it's a

909
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,640
how we call it

910
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,920
personal

911
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,880
is a

912
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,599
per person

913
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,839
so you

914
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,440
register and what you get is a

915
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,560
version let me see if i can log in

916
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,880
we create an instant for you of a for

917
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,079
free forever

918
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,200
the software i was showing you but the

919
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,040
the version forward it has is the new

920
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,960
front end but the back end is the same

921
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,720
it's pretty much what i was showing you

922
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,800
the functionality but it's just a mainly

923
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,200
different front end

924
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,319
so what i'm going to show you now

925
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,119
okay so

926
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,040
we have a tool called

927
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,359
switch keywords

928
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,760
our basically ci

929
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,680
which allows you to

930
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,880
play with the all all the things i did

931
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,400
show you on the

932
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,079
graphical interface but using the cli

933
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,440
csh console basically

934
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
so

935
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,520
authenticate

936
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,320
okay once you authenticate you either

937
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,560
can run it from a specific

938
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,680
from uh for example

939
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,880
see like command and you tell the

940
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,839
workspace like

941
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,839
what was it

942
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,200
and you give a nuclear

943
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,800
report

944
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,640
for example this one

945
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,560
so you can run it like that what it does

946
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,640
is going to be sending the

947
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,280
that nuclei nuclei report into fallout

948
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,680
for example from a cli

949
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,319
i have too many mouses

950
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,560
of course

951
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,359
i managed to get your um

952
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,599
uh free trial

953
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,359
full version

954
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,680
url posted to the chat but could you

955
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,839
could you paste can you copy and paste

956
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,119
the uh

957
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,480
github link into the chat

958
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,320
um yeah

959
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,800
this one

960
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,040
i think is wise thank you so much

961
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,440
there you go

962
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,760
so now if i

963
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,680
that's fantastic

964
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,919
so good

965
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,440
just to clarify on the

966
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,920
on the free trial it's not really a try

967
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,720
it's a full version

968
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,280
so it doesn't expire

969
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,400
the

970
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,880
is designed for

971
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,520
for individuals or small companies that

972
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,280
they don't really have a security team

973
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,440
or it's very nice

974
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,560
small fit

975
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,920
so we're trying to go back to the

976
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,119
community and provide people with it

977
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,440
easy and right tools to work on security

978
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,560
our goal is to make

979
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,440
security aware everyone but

980
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,240
now everyone has a know-how and skills

981
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
so we provide it for free

982
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,000
it's not it's not a trial that's what i

983
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,720
meant it doesn't expire

984
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,480
that's pretty amazing man thank you very

985
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,079
much this is

986
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,760
i mean i i can show you

987
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,359
as a pentester

988
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,920
of sometimes in the past i've been

989
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,760
forced to buy certain commercial

990
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,280
products

991
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,760
basically because of the reports

992
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,440
during the report was an absolute

993
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,960
nightmare

994
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,480
the outputs from tools are disparate

995
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,119
and obviously you have your clients i'm

996
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,200
not sure if provincial is here but he he

997
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,960
could probably tell you too

998
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,520
it's a it's the nightmare to try to put

999
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,599
all this stuff together and this this

1000
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,079
this is it comes out nicely

1001
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,319
he presented in a pdf that's that's

1002
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,440
pretty awesome

1003
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,000
this is this

1004
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,079
yeah about the let me see if i can

1005
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,400
actually

1006
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,720
wash it this

1007
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,000
this one

1008
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
that's one look

1009
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000

i just want this skewers in japanese

1012
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,599
there's a reason

1013
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,240
the layout is different

1014
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760

1015

1035
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,520
recording

1036
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,079
right okay this is the template

1037
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,240
quickly

1038
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,720
will be under i can actually place um

1039
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720

uh

1041
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,800

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,319
hackers i'm gonna i'm gonna paste it

1043

uh no i think we are good i mean i'm

1051
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,160
just showing you how to automate stuff

1052
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,880
during the clip so maybe i don't know

1053
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,400
ten minutes

1054
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,560
do you have two minutes no eight minutes

1055
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,200
okay that's great um any other questions

1056

1080
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,760

1081
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,440

1082
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,839

1084
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,839

1085
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,200
more if you want no problem

1086
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,240
all right emilio uh

1087
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,399
okay

1088
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,079
this is the as i was saying you they

1089
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,079
i can't really see it's too far

1090
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,040
but anyway so i can select workspace

1091
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,160
select for example nmap right

1092
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,000
that will just tell me that what

1093
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,520
workspace i'm selecting and if i do

1094
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,359
just the command

1095
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,200
i click

1096
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,280
for example and then i run my normal

1097
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,800
nmap

1098
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,119
local course

1099
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,200
that's running in my localhost but

1100
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,760
however because i put foreign before

1101
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,359
that if i now goes to

1102
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,480
nmap

1103
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,079
workspace you will see no

1104
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,960
vulnerabilities because map i just run

1105
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,400
on localhost

1106
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,960
it's just port so you can find an asset

1107
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,560
this comes from mob

1108
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,400
as you can see this command that i just

1109
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
run in the cli automatically get

1110
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,160
imported into the gui

1111
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,040
i should make this bigger

1112
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,839
there you

1113
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,680
go so this is one of the things that you

1114
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,440
can do run commands directly from the

1115
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,680
cli you can also

1116
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,399
pipe things up for example if i do a

1117
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,920
let's call it

1118
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,920
so this is one way to automate

1119
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,200
this japanese keyboard

1120
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,839
low

1121
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,760
battery there you go so

1122
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,599
from

1123
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,160
3000

1124
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,759
where i will find the pipe

1125
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,880
so for example i call new clay

1126
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,200
let me go closer to the there you go

1127
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,839
i call the play and i

1128
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,160
throw the template to template

1129
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,520
play the json and then i do

1130
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,240
and they call faraday

1131
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,440
i call

1132
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,319
the

1133
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,280
tool

1134
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,960
report this is the way that you can

1135
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,720
actually start to automate stuff with

1136
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,839
the

1137
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,960
demo and i cannot i actually

1138
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,560
this is a cool stuff

1139
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
it's called pipeline let's call it

1140
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,720
whatever you want to call it

1141
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,959
so

1142
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,599
so what i'm doing in this line if you

1143
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,359
can see is i'm

1144
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,599
just giving play a

1145
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,079
list of hosts and web servers in case

1146
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,440
this is one

1147
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,760
so and send it to a temporary file and

1148
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,160
call it faraday to import that temporary

1149
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,319
file in a specific workspace called demo

1150
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,640
and also tag all the vulnerabilities

1151
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,720
that come through called attack code

1152
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,960
called pipeline

1153
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,920
so if i go back to my

1154
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,680
joint id this then

1155
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,800
the demo was it was there

1156
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,000
so

1157
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,680
this

1158
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,520
i don't know if you can really see but

1159
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,640
there's two tags three tags this is here

1160
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,720
you can see tax here that's a pipeline

1161
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,200
so import tubulin abilities that found

1162
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,880
right that come from new play

1163
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,040
automatically important to follower and

1164
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,599
specifically at attack this allows me

1165
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:20,960
actually to

1166
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,160
then filter by

1167
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,680
if i

1168
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,000
filter by tap in this case i have two

1169
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,359
but let's say i import another

1170
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:36,440
i don't have a here report maybe i do

1171
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,920
i don't know it's not 3.4

1172
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,680
but hopefully has some vulnerabilities

1173
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,839
in it

1174
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,920
this is a way to add burp

1175
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,319
remember that you ask about xml for

1176
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,599
example

1177
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,359
yeah so this will add boot into

1178
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,558
demo as well let's put in them

1179
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,599
now if i go to demo and refresh

1180
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,760
it

1181
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,880
i got all these abilities coming from if

1182
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,880
i had the tool

1183
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,359
from burp nuclei they all mix it up but

1184
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,839
you see that nuclei tool has actually

1185
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,160
hacked pipeline that allow me to when i

1186
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,160
do reports or whatever i want to do i

1187
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,040
can

1188
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,480
use tags for filtering things

1189
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,839
so that's one of the main features that

1190
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:48,800
we are cool

1191
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,720
and the last thing i want to show if i

1192
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,119
have what do i have two minutes

1193
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,359
uh for example i want to do it correctly

1194
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,400
let me try to see if i can copy

1195
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,599
basically this is a long line

1196
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,160
just to make your life easier right

1197
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,119
okay

1198
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,359
yeah

1199
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,359
i will do

1200
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,680
executive

1201
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,640
i can't really see it from here

1202
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,118
let me see if i can type correctly nope

1203
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,079
deep

1204
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,640
report

1205
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,359
this is going to be painful on the

1206
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,078
japanese queue

1207
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,000
okay

1208
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,680
and this is where the things goes if i

1209
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,240
start to

1210
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,800
i will never find the key the correct

1211
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,000
escaping piece this cue ever

1212
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,359
thinks this one

1213
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,880
if i start to put like this

1214
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,440
no it's not going to work because my

1215
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,720
keyword is just not

1216
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,559
[Music]

1217
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,000
no worries

1218
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,800
that was a great demo uh thank you very

1219
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,599
much thank you uh emilio and thank you

1220
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,559
josh

1221
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,440
for uh providing us this

1222
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,720
um

1223
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,000
excellent presentation and demo um

1224
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,559
we do have tons of pentesters in the

1225
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,040
east coast and i didn't see many of them

1226
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,520
today so they truly missed out

1227
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,040
hopefully they will watch this stock

1228
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,280
uh as we publish it

1229
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,920
um and uh i like to thank you very much

1230
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,680
and maybe we'll have you guys someday in

1231
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,640
the future when you have any updates and

1232
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,520
other cool stuff to show

1233
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,240
okay thank you very much

1234
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,960
yeah no thank you guys for having us i

1235
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,040
put my email in the chat so if anyone

1236
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,280
wants more information you know reach

1237
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,480
reach out or appear to be a resource so

1238

again

1241
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,359
and um adam are you ready

1242
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,319
yes sir um

1243
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,079
could you just tell me how to screen

1244
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,040
share

1245
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,720
yeah i just want to make your presenter

1246
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,959
now

1247
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,680
great right so you're a presenter now

1248
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,359
all you have to do

1249
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,160
is

1250
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,280
uh click on if you have the client you

1251
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,800
have to click what is this

1252
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,160
there's an icon that shows like a screen

1253
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,599
click on it

1254
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,359
and then

1255
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,800
you can choose

1256
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,599
to share only the app or the desktop

1257
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,760
right i'm going through my preferences

1258
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,960
right now

1259
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,280
okay

1260
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,559
so i gave it accessibility and i'm gonna

1261
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,559
have to restart go to meeting

1262
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,440
yeah i that's fine we'll wait for you go

1263

00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,400
kicked out

1265
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,920
and then when you come back i'll set you

1266
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,040
back as a presenter again

1267
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,640
okay hello

1268
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,400

1270
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,240
yeah at one point i just gave you a

1271
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,640
presenter

1272
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,520
again my gosh i'm gonna have to give

1273
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,040
preferences again hold on

1274
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,200
it should be fine though

1275
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,440
well no now it wants uh the ability to

1276
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,200
record the screen

1277
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,800
oh um

1278
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,960
i will have to restart

1279
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,800
that's fine no wait wait

1280
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,880
all right so uh to all of you who are

1281
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,040
still there and uh we're gonna see adam

1282
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,119
finkel uh in just a minute uh he's gonna

1283
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,119
talk about bioinformatics looking

1284
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,800
forward to this talk

1285
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,800
um remember uh i put a link for the

1286
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,280
discord keep in touch you can stay in

1287
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,200
touch all the time by going to discord

1288
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,240
we have tons of channels including jobs

1289
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,040
trainings um threat intelligence you

1290
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,520
name it you want to be in the discord

1291
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,680
that's what we're constantly talking and

1292
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,720
of course

1293
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,800
on october 30th we're gonna have the

1294
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,079
south florida issa

1295
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,559
um pack the flag which

1296
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,400
hopefully one day

1297
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,119
we would do it again uh or replicate it

1298
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,280
in silicon valley and like anything

1299
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,599
silicon valley is usually bigger

1300
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,839
and better so adam are you back

1301
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,960
yes sir okay so now i should be able to

1302
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,559
share my screen

1303
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:21,760
okay right

1304
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,640
because you've got to make your

1305
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,118
presenter

1306
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,200
that's weird

1307
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,440
applications maybe

1308
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,079
terminal that's odd

1309
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,319
you should be able to what what do you

1310
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,000
have a google doc or or no it's a it's a

1311
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,760
keynote

1312
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,119
oh

1313
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,599
i've just never done this before okay

1314
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:48,640
there we go

1315
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,839
okay

1316
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:54,720
um i'm gonna do that and i can share the

1317
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,880
keynote

1318
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,480
um

1319
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,440
looking good okay can you guys see that

1320
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,960
yeah excellent

1321
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,960
go for it awesome

1322
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,680
so this is about a little bit more than

1323
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,440
bioinformatics

1324
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,200
um

1325
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,319
this is really about bringing the fourth

1326
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:18,839
industrial revolution to biotech r d

1327
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:23,119
and i'm really excited to tell you about

1328
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,799
the challenges that biotech r d faces

1329
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,359
and the opportunity that we have now

1330
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,520
because the technology has finally come

1331
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,480
together

1332
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,680
uh for us to make biotech

1333
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,599
research and development

1334
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,119
much faster

1335
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,400
cheaper

1336
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,319
sure and to be able to reach beyond what

1337
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,520
we have an exhaustive fundamental

1338
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,760
mechanistic explanation for to be able

1339
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,880
to

1340
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,520
make things do what we want

1341
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,200
while still just treating them as a

1342
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,559
black box

1343
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,000
and

1344
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,040
this framework that i've come up with

1345
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,640
uh to do that

1346
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,440
um with the help of my friend grace reed

1347
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,240
is called automatic parallel exploration

1348
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,240
of systems or apes

1349
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,720
uh and yes we chose that name

1350
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,359
deliberately

1351
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,040
and so the basic idea is to experiment

1352
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,160
model optimize and repeat

1353
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,760
so here's the status quo of biotech r d

1354
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,480
there's a very long time to market

1355
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,280
in fact it's the opposite of what we see

1356
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,119
in semiconductors

1357
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,280
where we have moore's law which says

1358
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,720
that every 18 months the density of

1359
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,000
transistors on a chip doubles well in

1360
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,960
biotech especially pharma we have erom's

1361
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,240
law which is moore's law in reverse

1362
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,119
where

1363
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,440
every 18 months or so

1364
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,359
the time to take a biotech drug to

1365
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,119
market doubles

1366
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,319
okay at this rate we just won't have

1367
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,839
more drugs

1368
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,400
right but we still need plenty more of

1369
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,640
them there are so many diseases out

1370
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,839
there that are huge killers

1371
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:14,000
mean just look at covid for example it

1372
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,079
was a hugely expensive effort to make

1373
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,760
the vaccine but we've still got

1374
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,240
parkinson's alzheimer's

1375
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,319
lung disease

1376
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,920
heart disease

1377
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,880
and those aren't individual diseases but

1378
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,680
whole categories of illness

1379
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,240
right so it's really important that we

1380
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,400
start treating these more quickly

1381
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,520
because people are suffering and dying

1382
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,240
every single minute of every single day

1383
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,799
okay if you've ever watched a clock tick

1384
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,599
that's about how often somebody dies

1385
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:46,559
okay

1386
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,720
so if we ever want to beat the grim

1387
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,680
reaper

1388
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,680
we are going to have to go a lot faster

1389
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,680
than we have been because it seems like

1390
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,760
we'll never get there

1391
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,319
now in business time is money and in

1392
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,319
biotech it's no different turning

1393
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,960
dollars into discoveries runs up a huge

1394
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,319
bill

1395
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:07,520
you wouldn't believe it but the uh idea

1396
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,839
of the underpaid scientist

1397
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,799
is largely limited to academia in

1398
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,040
industry you can make quite a pretty

1399
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,760
penny as a research scientist

1400
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,440
and you're going to need plenty of them

1401
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,480
to bring a drug to market or a synthetic

1402
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,359
biology product to market

1403
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,640
and then you're going to need support

1404
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,720
staff everything that you would need in

1405
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,920
a regular business legal accounting hr

1406
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
sales marketing

1407
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,799
it all adds up and the longer that you

1408
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,119
have to wait in that vulnerable early

1409
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,920
stage of pre-clinical development before

1410
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,880
you get that momentum behind you

1411
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,119
the easier it is

1412
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,760
to say well i guess the research just

1413
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,000
didn't turn up anything viable looks

1414
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,920
like we're gonna have to close up shop

1415
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,200
and then it's not a question of when but

1416
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,960
a question of if

1417
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,599
and that brings me to the third point

1418
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,480
where we have lots of overruns delays

1419
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,040
and failure in the biotech industry

1420
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,680
erum's law is claiming plenty of

1421
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,680
businesses and startups and so that

1422
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,319
limits opportunities it is very hard to

1423
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,880
get people to take you seriously now

1424
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,640
because biotechies have gotten so

1425
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,680
paranoid okay i've had you know people

1426
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,160
say well geez you know if they're not

1427
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,319
from the ivs why am i even looking at

1428
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,119
them because of these huge risks so this

1429
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,640
is something that has got to change

1430
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,720
and that's why

1431
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,720
we came up with apes

1432
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,760
so

1433
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,720
the first problem is that experiments

1434
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,000
are done

1435
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,440
right now

1436
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,160
largely in the industry like they were

1437
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,000
200 years ago

1438
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,559
there's a person in a clean white lab

1439
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,799
coat with some beakers

1440
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,280
and maybe we have some slightly nicer

1441
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,440
bench tools but that's about it they're

1442
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,960
doing the experiments manually it's slow

1443
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,839
you can only do them one at a time

1444
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:07,839
you can't do very many of them at once

1445
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,760
and there's a lot of human error and

1446
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,880
random noise that gets worked in

1447
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,960
well now

1448
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,040
and for a long time we've had these

1449
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,319
machines

1450
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,119
that allow us to do many experiments at

1451
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,920
once so we want to use those machines to

1452
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,559
do many fast experiments that are

1453
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,040
because they're mechanical repeatable

1454
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,960
right test each hypothesis multiple

1455
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,559
times

1456
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,040
and test many hypotheses

1457
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,720
of course we've had these machines for a

1458
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,880
while and the next challenge was what to

1459
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,640
do with all the data they create

1460
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,720
it was actually surprisingly difficult

1461
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,559
there's a lot of uber proprietary

1462
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,960
software and firmware on these things

1463
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,599
and it's only been in the past few years

1464
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,200
that companies like benchling and

1465
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,440
datadot have created

1466
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,680
commercially off-the-shelf services

1467
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:02,559
sorry

1468
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,000
that would let us

1469
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,799
manage the torrent of data that these

1470
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:13,280
really expensive uh really big

1471
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,079
uh high throughput machines create

1472
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,040
but even with that and even with

1473
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,799
both of those services rapidly

1474
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,799
decreasing in price

1475
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:26,000
as they have there was the problem of

1476
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,799
what to do with all of this data um

1477
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:32,240
again just talking to uh data scientists

1478
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,400
in biotech the

1479
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,040
response i got was that mostly they do

1480
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,880
things like you might have done

1481
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,040
even 50 years ago

1482
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,440
you try this regression that regression

1483
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,240
that

1484
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,440
clustering

1485
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,000
all by hand and it usually turns up

1486
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,480
nothing because there's just so little

1487
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,040
data and it's such poor quality

1488
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,240
right we need some way

1489
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:56,960
to

1490
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,960
take that human

1491
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,680
limitation out of the system

1492
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,559
right

1493
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:03,440
and

1494
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,079
generate suggestions for new experiments

1495
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,559
automatically so that

1496
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,559
after we've run through this process of

1497
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,480
generating the data in the high

1498
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,079
throughput machines

1499
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,480
sharing it seamlessly to the data

1500
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,480
scientists

1501
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,200
and generating a hypothesis

1502
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,760
automatically we can iterate because

1503
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,920
that's the other thing about biotech

1504
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,160
it's a loop

1505
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,440
it goes around and around and around as

1506
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,480
you can see

1507
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,280
right we go from

1508
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,160
these high throughput machines

1509
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,440
to the

1510
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,079
what i call cloud lab notebooks to the

1511
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:43,760
automatic machine learning and back

1512
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,720
again

1513
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,520
okay

1514
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,839
each time refining what we're

1515
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,599
accomplishing

1516
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,319
right getting closer and closer to

1517
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,720
discovery

1518
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,520
now

1519
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,760
let's talk a little bit more

1520
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,720
about

1521
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,160
when to use this all right it's not a

1522
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,359
silver bullet and there are simpler ways

1523
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:06,960
of getting the job done

1524
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,960
uh bristol-myers squibb has done some

1525
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,839
very good deep learning work uh in

1526
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:12,960
chemistry

1527
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,240
and

1528
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,400
the key thing is that the

1529
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,520
system has to be unknown and complex

1530
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,160
okay for apes to really be worth your

1531
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,599
while to adopt

1532
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,280
the experiments have to be slow and

1533
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,599
costly you can't just have

1534
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,240
huge piles of you know reactants

1535
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,559
and to be able

1536
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,960
to do a million experiments really

1537
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,400
cheaply because at that point you might

1538
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,319
as well just use deep learning

1539
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,079
okay and that it's a trial and error

1540
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,480
process where there's a lot of unknowns

1541
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,880
here it is worth it to adopt this

1542
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,599
process because you can't just

1543
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,760
brute force it by trying every

1544
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,359
possibility

1545
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:55,599
okay

1546
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,160
so let's go into a little bit more depth

1547
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,599
about each of the subsections of this

1548
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,599
apes loop

1549
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:04,799
we start with high throughput

1550
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,559
experiments

1551
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:08,240
as you can see

1552
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,880
there are many of those pipettes right

1553
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,079
and this isn't the only kind of

1554
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:13,680
high-throughput machine but it's a very

1555
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,880
common one this is one that does uh an

1556
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,440
a large plate assay

1557
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,799
essentially

1558
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,079
each of the

1559
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:24,720
plates that you see there has many many

1560
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,440
little wells and those tubes those

1561
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,440
pipettes you see inject things into them

1562
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,160
and then some reaction ensues maybe

1563
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,960
you're putting yeast cells into agar

1564
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,599
jelly and the cells multiply and you see

1565
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:40,799
what they make because you're trying to

1566
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,680
get the yeast to make biofuel for you

1567
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,680
okay

1568
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,400
and so you can see that these machines

1569
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,240
allow you to have many trials at once

1570
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,480
it's not just one person with one of

1571
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,359
those pipettes and one little well that

1572
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:59,200
they're just trying to squirt stuff into

1573
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,160
this thing runs really fast it can do

1574
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,359
each of those plates in under a second

1575
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,680
the equipment is completely automated so

1576
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,200
it's consistent

1577
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,319
and even though you do still have to pay

1578
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,400
even at the low end a few grand for a

1579
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,440
machine like this the unit cost of an

1580
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,160
experiment especially once you have

1581
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,000
plonked down the cash is very very low

1582
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,559
so there's no longer a barrier to

1583
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,640
running a lot of them as long as you can

1584
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,319
afford the reagents

1585
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:33,200
and furthermore not only can you test

1586
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,920
many possibilities but you can test each

1587
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,720
one many times to make sure that

1588
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,480
positive or negative results aren't just

1589
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,720
flukes

1590
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,400
now let's talk about the cloud and the

1591
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,480
cloud lab notebooks step two in this

1592
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,760
process

1593
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,839
they let you share data and notes

1594
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,880
seamlessly so everything from

1595
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,200
saying well what was the concentration

1596
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,640
of hydrochloric acid in this well to

1597
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,880
oops i jerked the machine when it was

1598
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,920
working i think this data set might be a

1599
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,440
little skewed all of it just works and

1600
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,559
that is the promise and it does deliver

1601
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,799
it is dead simple to use we have tried

1602
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,280
benchling it is amazing um we haven't

1603
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,200
tried data dot but i'm pretty sure

1604
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,000
they're going to do a good job of it too

1605
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,920
and the key thing here is that they are

1606
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,799
automatic especially data dot will just

1607
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,480
suck the data right off your high

1608
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,400
throughput machines and put it on the

1609
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,720
cloud or you can go manipulate it with

1610
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,720
uh with cloud lab notebooks like

1611
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,559
benchlink

1612
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,240
and they will work with standard

1613
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,079
software they are available completely

1614
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,160
off the shelf you don't need any special

1615
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,640
training it's not some complicated

1616
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,440
contract thing it's a lot more

1617
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,559
like honestly using a jupiter notebook

1618
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,480
than anything else it's not even like

1619
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,559
trying to work with some cloud provider

1620
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,720
it's not even that complicated okay

1621
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,200
and finally the ps3 resistance

1622
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,359
so this

1623
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,359
automated machine learning

1624
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:04,480
right

1625
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,359
the big hurdle here has been the small

1626
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,920
size and high dimensionality of

1627
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,599
biological data

1628
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,760
and

1629
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,480
it wasn't known whether we could do ml

1630
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,680
on it but thanks to the tireless efforts

1631
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,039
of people

1632
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,599
from a consortium of national

1633
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,240
laboratories in the u.s

1634
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,559
we have developed an algorithm

1635
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,079
uh that will

1636
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,520
crack what is called the small n problem

1637
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,880
it models the biological system suggests

1638
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,680
new trials and works without having to

1639
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,400
understand the underlying system

1640
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,720
it treats it as a black box

1641
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,720
and just looks

1642
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,440
at

1643
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,720
the inputs that you have and the outputs

1644
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,920
that you want

1645
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,319
and it will find things that humans just

1646
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:56,079
can't because it considers so many

1647
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:58,319
things at once

1648
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:01,440
so let's take a look at an example from

1649
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,039
the paper that was published

1650
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,680
when the national laboratories came out

1651
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,599
with the automatic recommendation tool

1652
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,720
okay they used it for several things

1653
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,920
one of them was to brew hoppy beer

1654
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,600
so to brew beer you have sugar

1655
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,000
and yeast

1656
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,479
in a

1657
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:26,560
deoxygenated environment

1658
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,640
right and you're going to have carbon

1659
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,279
dioxide and alcohol come out of it now

1660
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,920
uh just a quick question here is there

1661
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,679
any way that i can

1662
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,679
minimize

1663
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,600
i guess not okay

1664
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,198
so

1665
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,640
as you can see this gets really really

1666
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,759
complicated you have dna transcription

1667
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,319
rna translation protein

1668
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,080
and on and on

1669
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,880
and you have all these equations and

1670
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,439
simulation outputs

1671
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,679
it's really difficult to just model this

1672
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:04,479
thing

1673
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,839
as some you know y equals mx plus b

1674
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:08,960
linear

1675
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,198
uh situation

1676
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,080
right

1677
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,759
so the way that apes helps

1678
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,238
is that

1679
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,640
it doesn't have to deal with all of that

1680
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,520
complexity right it just finds the

1681
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,560
relationship between outputs and inputs

1682
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,880
right

1683
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,439
all you need to figure out

1684
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:34,960
is how to get the biggest by-product

1685
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,839
yield of this metabolic process that

1686
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,319
already exists in the yeast uh but that

1687
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,439
you have created

1688
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:44,319
uh

1689
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,600
some edit to right you've modified the

1690
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,279
yeast's dna

1691
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,279
uh to produce a different uh byproduct

1692
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,640
right and you verify this in the wet lab

1693
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,880
right where you create franken yeast

1694
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,199
with a different number of protein

1695
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,520
regulators so those control

1696
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,760
um how much of a certain protein is

1697
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,640
expressed right those are your inputs

1698
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,440
if you have

1699
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,159
depending on whether they um

1700
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:16,320
promote or inhibit the expression of the

1701
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,360
protein

1702
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,320
and

1703
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,840
you're going to have a different amount

1704
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,360
of it expressed and that's going to

1705
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,280
affect the metabolic process

1706
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,360
and so the uh the byproduct that you're

1707
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,120
looking for

1708
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,120
and then you grow the frankin yeast in

1709
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,679
batches recording the data into your

1710
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,679
cell database so

1711
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,080
that's where we were talking about the

1712
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,159
high throughput experiments imagine

1713
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,080
having a whole bunch of this franken

1714
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,600
yeast all in slightly different strains

1715
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,320
that you've engineered and you have a

1716
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,800
dozen examples of it in each row of that

1717
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,520
assay plate and being able to try all of

1718
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,560
them at once without having to spend all

1719
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,880
day in the lab setting everything up

1720
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,960
right

1721
01:10:58,960 --> 01:10:59,760
now

1722
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,199
if the data differs from the prediction

1723
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,679
you can make the simulation uh match and

1724
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,719
try again so the idea is

1725
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:11,440
that you can feed this information back

1726
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,120
into

1727
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,840
this small end machine learning tool

1728
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,080
called art the automatic recommendation

1729
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,960
tool

1730
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,840
um

1731
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,880
and it will learn from its mistakes

1732
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,520
right now if you've got matching data

1733
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,080
you've got a new vector to transfect

1734
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,679
into

1735
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,159
chinese hamster ovaries

1736
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,640
i will not go into the details of those

1737
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,600
so much

1738
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,880
but

1739
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,280
you can

1740
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,199
obviously do more

1741
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:42,960
with this than just brewing yourself

1742
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,840
some beer you can also grow monoclonal

1743
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,920
antibodies okay

1744
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,800
so

1745
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,239
a monoclonal antibody what is that well

1746
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,480
monoclonal means that

1747
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,840
they are all cloned from the single cell

1748
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,600
right there's just one

1749
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,840
common ancestor that they have

1750
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:02,640
right

1751
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,159
and they are designed to bind to one

1752
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:09,440
target so you've chosen something

1753
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,040
and that you want to target in the body

1754
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,080
um

1755
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,000
and you design a white blood cell

1756
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,440
that

1757
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:22,239
will produce the antibody that will

1758
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,080
target that thing

1759
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,320
right

1760
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,440
and then you clone the white blood cell

1761
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,239
and extract these antibodies and the

1762
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:35,280
crazy thing is that you can get the

1763
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,719
antibodies to stick to just about

1764
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,120
anything and whatever binds to the

1765
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,679
antibody will bind to the target so

1766
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,520
let's say that you wanted a chemical

1767
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,600
that would neutralize a toxin

1768
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,000
you could have it bind to the antibody

1769
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,960
right which binds to the toxin

1770
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,880
the chemicals interact

1771
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,520
the toxin is neutralized right

1772
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,520
and these are used throughout

1773
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,719
biochemistry medicine molecular biology

1774
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,719
they're an already existing and

1775
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,960
established tech

1776
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,840
right

1777
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,040
so again

1778
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,360
apes can help here

1779
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,120
so

1780
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,440
the way that dna affects how these

1781
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,360
antibodies are produced is really

1782
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,560
complicated

1783
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,159
and it's pretty chaotic too the cell

1784
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:26,239
isn't so much a neat orderly little city

1785
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,280
more like a wild party where things just

1786
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,760
kind of crash bang into other things

1787
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,920
even though there's some order

1788
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,679
okay

1789
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:38,239
so if you're trying

1790
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,320
to get the

1791
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,760
cell to produce something you kind of

1792
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,080
just have to treat it like a black box

1793
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,640
where you have just a certain number of

1794
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,760
copies

1795
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,320
of this gene and some other copies of

1796
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,400
another gene and you can have more genes

1797
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,040
than two obviously this is just a really

1798
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,760
simplified graph

1799
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,960
right and this small end machine

1800
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,120
learning the art the automatic

1801
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,719
recommendation tool

1802
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,920
will say okay we've seen how fiddling

1803
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,320
with each of these affects the output

1804
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,520
here are some suggestions to try

1805
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,400
right

1806
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,480
and then you can try those uh

1807
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,719
simultaneously and quickly in the

1808
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,080
laboratory

1809
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,199
right

1810
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,199
have the data hoovered up into those

1811
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:28,159
cloud lab notebooks

1812
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,760
feed it back in

1813
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,719
to improve apes i'm sorry to improve the

1814
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,840
automatic recommendation tools guesses

1815
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,679
right

1816
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,560
so the wet lab verification works very

1817
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,640
much the same

1818
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,040
as the um

1819
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,360
as in brewing the hoppy beer

1820
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,840
you create frankin dna with the number

1821
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,080
of gene regulators recommended

1822
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,280
by the automatic recommendation tool

1823
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,280
or apes depends on whether you want to

1824
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,400
take the

1825
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,400
big or small view of it you grow the

1826
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,679
franken dna and chinese hamster ovaries

1827
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:04,640
this is

1828
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,719
a common cell line that we use for this

1829
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,000
kind of work

1830
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
recording the cell data into your cell

1831
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,719
database and if the data differs from

1832
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:13,840
the prediction

1833
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,600
right you are going to have to make that

1834
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,600
model match and try again if the data

1835
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,280
matches you've got new data to transfect

1836
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:23,199
so

1837
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:24,880
here's a little bit more about that

1838
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,040
automatic recommendation tool so that

1839
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,800
you can visualize it it's a little

1840
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,000
easier to see right so on the far left

1841
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,159
you have each of these instances right

1842
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,400
each of those would be say

1843
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,280
one

1844
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,199
um

1845
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,320
row

1846
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,679
of trials in that big assay machine

1847
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:45,840
right and you have

1848
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,400
um a different set of inputs

1849
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,239
right and these could be anything

1850
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,159
proteomics so that's about protein

1851
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,159
transcriptomics which is about the

1852
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:57,360
transcription of dna into rna

1853
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,520
promoter combinations media components

1854
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,520
you name it

1855
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,600
and each of those has an associated

1856
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,360
response

1857
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,440
you feed all of that into art and

1858
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,199
remember you're not going to get flukes

1859
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:10,560
because you're trying this many many

1860
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,840
times at once

1861
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:12,640
right

1862
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,600
and

1863
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,520
it gives you

1864
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,800
right through this artificial

1865
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,000
intelligence

1866
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,480
recommendations

1867
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,560
for what you should do next right and

1868
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,920
you can see

1869
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,719
that little graph there

1870
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,280
and that's what you try in the lab

1871
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,159
right

1872
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:31,520
now how does the automatic

1873
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,199
recommendation tool work well for all of

1874
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:35,280
you ml heads out there

1875
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,600
it combines a priori knowledge and data

1876
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,000
which is the stuff that you know going

1877
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:40,800
in

1878
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,600
right

1879
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,520
you happen to know that the system works

1880
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,440
in such in such a way

1881
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,560
that you know this is how the

1882
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,280
experiments were set up etc etc

1883
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,960
and then it does something pretty

1884
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,880
incredible rather than taking a deep

1885
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,040
learning approach of using a whole bunch

1886
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,679
of data to try to

1887
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,960
almost brute force uh its way toward the

1888
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,640
truth it tries every traditional machine

1889
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,400
learning model at once essentially

1890
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,000
and the thing about traditional machine

1891
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,400
learning models is they're not as good

1892
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,920
as deep learning

1893
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,760
but they're much more robust they don't

1894
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,400
need nearly as much data to give you a

1895
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,280
good recommendation

1896
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,600
they can fail if they don't get a data

1897
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,199
set that they like

1898
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:26,000
but

1899
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
in general if you get a whole bunch of

1900
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,120
them

1901
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,360
many of them will succeed

1902
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,159
and if you have another layer

1903
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,280
on top

1904
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,960
this sort of bayesian layer that looks

1905
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,760
which way the models are pointing

1906
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,480
even if some of them have failed it's

1907
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,040
not going to be swayed too much by them

1908
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,199
and it creates a joint probability

1909
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,199
distribution

1910
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,080
of

1911
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,480
its best guesses about what the system

1912
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,560
is doing and those are the ones that you

1913
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,480
try

1914
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,800
in the lab after it optimizes them right

1915
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,480
if it guesses that

1916
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,800
you know tweaking such and such

1917
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,360
gene is going to make the cell produce

1918
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,719
more beer

1919
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,719
right or more monoclonal antibody that

1920
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,280
you want right

1921
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,000
then it will crank that gene up for its

1922
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,679
next recommendation

1923
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,000
and as you can see

1924
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,640
we don't need to have a breakthrough in

1925
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,960
fundamental biology to deliver

1926
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,400
some sort of

1927
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,960
uh full mechanistic explanation of

1928
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,280
what's going on it's entirely a black

1929
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,159
box approach and that's all enabled

1930
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:36,640
by something called teapot okay it

1931
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:39,040
automates model selection

1932
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,640
so

1933
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,400
you have to get the raw data yourself

1934
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,239
that's coming from the cloud lab

1935
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,320
notebooks that are being fed by the high

1936
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,400
throughput experiments

1937
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,840
yes you're going to need to do some data

1938
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,239
cleaning too this isn't a full

1939
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,040
automation of biotech we're still going

1940
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,040
to need people but they're not going to

1941
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,840
have to do as much grunt work anymore

1942
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,719
and the rest teapot takes care of from

1943
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:03,840
feature selection to feature

1944
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,920
pre-processing feature construction

1945
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,120
model selection

1946
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,560
it delivers

1947
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,679
what you need which is a model

1948
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:15,520
right

1949
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,159
and it does not require you to

1950
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:20,960
understand how the system works just to

1951
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,679
associate these inputs and outputs which

1952
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:25,600
it does itself

1953
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,480
right

1954
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,400
and so

1955
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,199
it

1956
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:32,000
works by copying your data set many

1957
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,199
times

1958
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,560
tries different features

1959
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,679
and then

1960
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:40,000
eliminates them and figures out which

1961
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,600
ones are the ones that are important and

1962
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,760
predictive

1963
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,679
and that's really the conclusion of the

1964
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,480
talk okay

1965
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,159
these technologies each of them

1966
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,159
is revolutionary but

1967
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:57,040
like apes they're stronger together

1968
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,280
and if we combine them

1969
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,600
we won't have to deal with nearly as

1970
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,280
much cost

1971
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,559
in terms of manpower

1972
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,360
risk of things going wrong because we

1973
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,480
just can't guess the right model

1974
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,440
time

1975
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,679
of having to grind and grind away by

1976
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:19,840
hand at tasks that we could automate

1977
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:23,520
and we can transcend the limits

1978
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,760
of biological research

1979
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,760
right even if we don't understand for

1980
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:32,000
example how a heart grows in all of its

1981
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,440
glorious detail we can still grow a

1982
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,159
heart and to everybody with heart

1983
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:40,639
disease right all those millions and

1984
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,480
millions of people out there that's what

1985
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,719
matters

1986
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,520
to everyone with lung cancer

1987
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,920
they don't need a textbook they need a

1988
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,920
new lung

1989
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,719
and if we can create those

1990
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,280
then we can save their lives

1991
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,360
at least for a while

1992
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,960
in the meantime

1993
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,920
we'll be able to do all of the you know

1994
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,080
grand and glorious endeavors of

1995
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,239
synthetic biology of

1996
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,560
curing parkinson's and maybe even

1997
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,880
reversing aging but for now it's

1998
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,440
essential that we be able

1999
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,080
to at least get biological systems to do

2000
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,880
what we want because the effects

2001
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,000
go way beyond just healthcare

2002
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
we can make biofuel beer or even use

2003
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,080
these cellular machines as little

2004
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,239
factories to make any material that we

2005
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:33,760
want

2006
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,080
only we can program them

2007
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,239
it'll be a fourth industrial revolution

2008
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,639
combining biotech computerized

2009
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:42,080
manufacturing and artificial

2010
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,239
intelligence like you've seen here so

2011
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:46,639
the opportunities abound if you go

2012
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,840
online and look at synthetic biology

2013
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,480
machine learning um

2014
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,880
you'll see that the number of papers

2015
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,280
about them is just skyrocketing

2016
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,480
all right

2017
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,440
and

2018
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,600
what we are most trying to do is build a

2019
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,360
community around this and just start

2020
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,719
talking about it

2021
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,960
because we grace and i and everyone

2022
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,719
who's working with us

2023
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,280
want to know what the specific

2024
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,960
challenges are because

2025
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,520
we founded a company to try to make it

2026
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,679
happen for biotech companies

2027
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,400
um right now it's just about consulting

2028
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,719
and custom solutions helping them figure

2029
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:25,040
out what exactly they need and setting

2030
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,880
it up for them because remember a

2031
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,880
biotech company is pretty busy doing

2032
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,040
research and the one thing it can't do

2033
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,000
is take people off the production line

2034
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,360
even if it had all the money in the

2035
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,120
world

2036
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,199
so we do think there's a

2037
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:41,679
business opportunity there but our

2038
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:43,199
biggest goal

2039
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:47,760
is to make biotech go faster because

2040
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,320
we have so much time left in our lives

2041
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,320
that we could really see many of the

2042
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,800
benefits that's our personal motivation

2043
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,719
and there are so many people out there

2044
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,520
suffering and dying on organ transplant

2045
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,560
lists

2046
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,159
or cancers that if only the organ could

2047
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:10,159
be removed the person could be saved

2048
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:13,120
and everything else synthetic meat bio

2049
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,520
fuel you name it

2050
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,800
if only we could control these systems

2051
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,480
whether or not we understand them and to

2052
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,600
do it in an economical way

2053
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,360
we could change the world

2054
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,280
thank you and i'm happy to answer all of

2055
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,840
your questions

2056
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,159
thank you for uh this presentation

2057
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,639
sounds pretty interesting um

2058
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,639
i'm not an expert on any of this but i

2059
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,320
was going to ask you have you reached

2060
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,239
like for example

2061
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:42,320
people like the open ai foundation for

2062
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,920
example for like processing power and

2063
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,920
or do you have like like proof of

2064
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,000
concept of some of those processes you

2065
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,800
you showed in the slides

2066
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,679
yeah so we got an academic license for

2067
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,840
the automatic recommendation tool from

2068
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,159
the national laboratories and

2069
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:03,600
we have been trying to get it to work on

2070
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,080
some data that grace has collected

2071
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,760
um

2072
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,199
and it's been tricky work it's kind of a

2073
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,440
a complicated tool to use

2074
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,400
um

2075
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,760
but we do believe that it's something

2076
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:18,800
um

2077
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,080
that

2078
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,080
can in fact be harnessed um

2079
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,199
now the other amazing thing is that even

2080
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:28,639
though it's

2081
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,400
the i.t challenges can be a little

2082
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,280
tricky

2083
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,920
um it's not a question of having enough

2084
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,840
processing power this is a totally

2085
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,920
different approach from the gazillion

2086
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,199
parameter

2087
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,679
you know racks and racks of stacks on

2088
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,360
stacks of graphics cards or even custom

2089
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:46,960
chips to power

2090
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,320
you know

2091
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,800
massive transformer models that machine

2092
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,560
learning has taken before this will run

2093
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:57,560
on a laptop an old laptop

2094
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,520
interesting thank you

2095
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:05,000
any other questions

2096
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,880
no more questions

2097
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,400
uh anything else do you want to tell me

2098
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,440
uh

2099
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,960
i have one more quickly

2100
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,840
yep

2101
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,120
uh interesting talk so uh

2102
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,400
this is part of my industry so um

2103
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,400
how is this how does this differ from

2104
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,000
what's going on with traditional high

2105
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,400
throughput screening in uh laboratory

2106
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,840
environments right now and also how

2107
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,440
um

2108
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,159
this almost seems like a combination of

2109
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,320
high throughput screening along with

2110
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,400
like compound management through

2111
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,719
automation am i am i catching this

2112
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:48,800
correctly but then you also have a

2113
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,120
component where you can actually lead

2114
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,480
the scientist down a path more so kind

2115
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,800
of how is it different than than you

2116
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,760
know cmg and um

2117
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,080
high throughput screening

2118
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,960
well it uh first of all it builds on

2119
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,880
high throughput screening so that's

2120
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,480
that's the

2121
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,400
the foundation of this if there weren't

2122
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,040
enough data to analyze and this wouldn't

2123
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,159
be possible at all so the idea is that

2124
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,000
now we have these high throughput

2125
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,560
machines what can we do with them can we

2126
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,960
get the data off them efficiently and

2127
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,040
can we analyze it in a way that like you

2128
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:25,840
said

2129
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,920
will rather than leaving the scientists

2130
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,679
to kind of wander the woods hoping they

2131
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,639
stumble upon the treasure to more circle

2132
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:33,760
the drain

2133
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,520
okay

2134
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,360
and that's the difference that art

2135
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,480
provides

2136
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,239
that's the challenge that it's cracked

2137
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:41,840
you're not going to be sitting around

2138
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,600
getting r squared equals zero for

2139
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,679
everything this will figure it out

2140
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,760
they've tried it they've used it it's

2141
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,120
worked every time so far

2142
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,120
and then so your larger component of

2143
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,840
apes is kind of trying to not trying i

2144
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,760
guess because you're doing it right

2145
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,719
i'm just trying to make sure i

2146
01:26:58,719 --> 01:26:59,760
understand

2147
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,960
um where you're trying to tie these kind

2148
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,360
of disparate systems together

2149
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,199
you know and to be able to provide

2150
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:09,920
people with uh

2151
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,560
clear clear data points more rapidly

2152
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:18,880
great so what what uh institutions have

2153
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,800
you partnered with you you've said that

2154
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,320
you have uh

2155
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,760
some licensing with uh

2156
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,400
nationals that's why science

2157
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,840
yeah so that um it no it's agile foundry

2158
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,080
that we got the art license from

2159
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,120
um

2160
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,679
and so far we've just been doing things

2161
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:40,719
on our own because i mean for one thing

2162
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,960
i've had to learn a heck of a lot about

2163
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,800
biotech um had to you know

2164
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,600
every month i was getting my mind blown

2165
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,280
and going oh it's this it's that it's

2166
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,679
the other thing and um i don't even mean

2167
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:55,120
to brag but like

2168
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,120
toward the end of it uh when i ran into

2169
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,280
the art paper this summer i was like oh

2170
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,600
what if we tried all the uh the

2171
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,960
traditional machine learning models at

2172
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,199
once and then lo and behold that's just

2173
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:07,520
what you know a bunch of post docs and

2174
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,159
phds and professors at the national labs

2175
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:12,080
have been working on for the better part

2176
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,440
of several years

2177
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,480
so

2178
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,199
um the whole field is kind of in flux

2179
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,400
and

2180
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,719
it's uh it would be tremendous to be

2181
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,719
able to partner with some institutions

2182
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,800
and that is what we're looking for

2183
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,320
um

2184
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,560
there's there's there's to to further

2185
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,840
complement that um um there's also

2186
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,320
a big push right now in lab automation

2187
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,560
to do cloud labs right where

2188
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,120
everything's completely done by robots

2189
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,280
you know where they dump to

2190
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,920
aws buckets and stuff like this

2191
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,120
um

2192
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,480
you know i

2193
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,320
i would think that that that would kind

2194
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,480
of be a perfect fit for that fit for

2195
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,159
this right we have our little cloud labs

2196
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,320
we say we want to run these

2197
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,400
these chemicals you know against these

2198
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,400
compounds we want to look for these

2199
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,880
reactions it's all done by machines no

2200
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,320
more no more human mistakes and then the

2201
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,719
scientists can then easily get that data

2202
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,440
all from their cloud lab notebooks

2203
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,280
but that's pretty exciting stuff thank

2204
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,080
you

2205
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,400
yeah that that's exactly the dream yes

2206
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,320
the the idea is

2207
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,199
that

2208
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:21,840
you literally just log in to a website

2209
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,639
and you say i want to do this this and

2210
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:25,840
the other thing

2211
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,040
and

2212
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,360
all you have to do is every so often you

2213
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,520
get a little buzz push notification on

2214
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,320
your phone and it's like you know do

2215
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,320
these suggestions seem reasonable yes or

2216
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,199
no and you know the the lab kind of runs

2217
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,239
itself

2218
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:42,080
um now obviously it's going to be a heck

2219
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,239
of a lot more complicated than that um

2220
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:46,480
the devil is always in the details

2221
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,120
that's why you know we've got uh one guy

2222
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,840
who wants to work with

2223
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,760
us um and he's in lab ops

2224
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,600
so i would love to talk with you some

2225
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,520
more about this i'm available all the

2226
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,960
time why don't i leave my linkedin uh in

2227
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,520
the chat for you

2228
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,800
please do

2229
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,840
um great

2230
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,719
any other questions

2231
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,120
are you zifty by the way guy who was

2232
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,280
just talking

2233
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:21,080
no uh loki

2234
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,719
so why don't you post your linkedin for

2235
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:37,199
everybody to see so you can decide when

2236
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:38,719
we uh send you a connection request

2237
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:40,239
whether you're not want to connect with

2238
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:41,760
us or not

2239
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,600
yep that's just what i'm doing right now

2240
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,880
i've been

2241
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,679
spent the past moment or two wrestling

2242
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:48,800
with

2243
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:49,679
uh

2244
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,440
go to meeting because i almost never use

2245
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:54,639
this platform um so i'm very

2246
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:57,120
confused i was trying to find my mouse

2247
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,960
figure out where the

2248
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,440
like little box to input things is

2249
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:04,559
usually i use zoom

2250
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,520
um if you want to check out the

2251
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,840
company website it's here too

2252
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,760
we have a twitter

2253
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,400
uh you can also show it yeah just

2254
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,040
share it on your screen and uh we'll

2255
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,440
charge it

2256
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,480
uh

2257
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,199
private window

2258
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,760
can you guys see me right now

2259
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,199
no

2260
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:29,120
your screen is all white

2261
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,040
the screen that you're sharing is all

2262
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,800
white so i don't know if it's the right

2263
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,920
window or device or whatever

2264
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:39,280
um how about now

2265
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,239
no um

2266
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,560
here

2267
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,120
how about now

2268
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,760
nothing oh there something's coming up

2269
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,480
let's see yes yes uh frankentech

2270
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,480
automating bioinformatics

2271
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,400
yep

2272
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:06,480
and so here's our website our framework

2273
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,280
and

2274
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:10,239
the frank and twitter

2275
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,320
are you uh

2276
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,159
boston aspiring software engineer

2277
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:21,199
physics senior yes sir

2278
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:23,280
we're already connected

2279
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,679
oh that's fantastic

2280
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,040
i just sent you a connection request i'm

2281
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,360
i'm interested too i i like what you're

2282
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,199
doing but i have to say there's a whole

2283
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:35,440
lot more to bioinformatics than

2284
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,120
than uh

2285
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,400
therapeutics design there's there's um

2286
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,880
diagnostics and there's

2287
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,239
of course

2288
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,159
you know you already know that's quite a

2289
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,679
bit of overlap i'm sure you've already

2290
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:50,080
considered but you know there's also

2291
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,840
remediation systems i work in

2292
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,679
pronunciation assessment for language

2293
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:54,719
learning

2294
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,120
and a lot of my customers involved with

2295
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,960
speech apraxia

2296
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,040
a condition where

2297
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,040
young children often will just refuse to

2298
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,440
speak or they will speak in a halting

2299
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,400
manner

2300
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,960
in such way that is often described as a

2301
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,440
speech impediment but is often

2302
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,440
uh more behavioral

2303
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,199
uh issue

2304
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:18,000
that doesn't have to do with the motor

2305
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,560
or cerebellum but it's more um

2306
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,560
hypothalamus limbic system oriented

2307
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,400
wow

2308
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,239
that's really incredible i mean our

2309
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:30,719
focus has generally been on biopharma

2310
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,280
and synthetic biology but now that you

2311
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:36,159
mention it yes um yeah i can i can tell

2312
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,080
yes it will you know if you

2313
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,639
if you go to the mesh the medical

2314
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,560
subject headings used for medline and

2315
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,639
pubmed uh you can see the whole ontology

2316
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:47,920
of all the

2317
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,800
topics in bioinformatics

2318
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,360
and there's a whole lot more

2319
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,320
there's a whole lot more than

2320
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,480
therapeutics and diagnostics

2321
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,600
and and but honestly

2322
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,440
don't get me wrong

2323
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,440
that is where the lowest hanging fruit

2324
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,000
is right now because you know if we can

2325
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,920
get something like as i was saying in

2326
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,199
the chat earlier

2327
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,600
if the treasury secretary of the united

2328
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,360
states decided that

2329
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,120
they would no longer be doing any

2330
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,960
financial transactions with anybody who

2331
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,520
use bitcoin but anybody who converted

2332
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,840
their bitcoin to curecoin which is a

2333
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,760
folding at home base cryptocurrency

2334
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,000
based on proof of useful work

2335
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,239
useful being

2336
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:30,480
adding to the protein folding database

2337
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,879
using the folding at home screen saver

2338
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,639
then

2339
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:37,920
it would make it so much easier for

2340
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:39,040
everybody who's trying to design

2341
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,840
antibodies or an algorithm that was

2342
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:42,960
trying to

2343
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,199
optimize an antibody or somebody's

2344
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:47,760
trying to design vaccines or an

2345
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,760
algorithm is trying to optimize the

2346
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,000
possibility of the vaccine might work

2347
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,159
all of those are helped by

2348
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:55,360
that uh

2349
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:57,920
alternative cryptocurrency which is

2350
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,239
uh maybe a little bit uh far-fetched but

2351
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:02,320
what i'm saying is i fully agree with

2352
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,639
you that therapeutics and diagnostics

2353
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:07,440
based on these peptides are

2354
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,280
definitely the lowest hanging fruit and

2355
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,840
i wish there was as much interest in my

2356
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,840
field of pronunciation assessment for

2357
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,280
language learning

2358
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,639
that there was in

2359
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:18,719
in peptide therapeutics and diagnostics

2360
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:20,800
but i think that might take a decade or

2361
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,080
two

2362
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:25,600
i mean it is really cool because it i

2363
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,600
feel like if you

2364
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,840
worked alongside the people trying to

2365
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:33,520
build chat bots and pronunciation bots

2366
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,119
that could be really helpful because

2367
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,520
google translate has the same problem

2368
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,600
that someone with a speech impairment

2369
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,600
does right

2370
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,280
neither of their

2371
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,679
brains knows how to talk yeah that's

2372
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:47,920
true google has a solution for that i'll

2373
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,679
post the link to google solution and

2374
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,679
chat but i'll tell you it's not the best

2375
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:53,520
solution it's um

2376
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,440
it's not anywhere near the state of the

2377
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,040
art

2378
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,040
oh no no i'm not saying that google

2379
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,880
should uh be the be all end all of this

2380
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,960
i'm saying that it sounds like those are

2381
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,400
two

2382
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,880
two kinds of the same problem and

2383
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,960
i would be really excited to see what

2384
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,800
kind of spillover there can be for the

2385
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,280
therapeutic side because

2386
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,480
it's you know it's one thing to

2387
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,320
make technology that helps people

2388
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,639
survive it's another thing to make

2389
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,960
technology that helps people live you

2390
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,119
know that there's a lot of satisfaction

2391
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:28,560
in someone who goes from just not being

2392
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,119
able to talk or barely being able to

2393
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:31,920
talk

2394
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,560
uh to being able to have at least close

2395
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,679
to a reasonable human conversation

2396
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,560
i have a question for you

2397
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,239
um are you working with calico at all

2398
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,639
i feel like we've heard of calico but

2399
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,840
we're not working with

2400
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,360
them would seem like that would be a

2401
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:58,480
tremendous uh area for your work

2402
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,080
yeah you know what they're doing

2403
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,840
um

2404
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,360
well it's certainly not interior

2405
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,600
furnishings

2406
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,960
no

2407
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,119
um

2408
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:15,040
and it was set up by google

2409
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,320
uh to do

2410
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,159
google knows they can get knocked off in

2411
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:20,400
the search engine business

2412
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,000
all somebody has to do is come up with

2413
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,320
better algorithm

2414
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,199
and

2415
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:28,159
uh they become another myspace

2416
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:29,119
and

2417
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,360
so they looked around to find where they

2418
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:32,400
wanted to

2419
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,960
invest you know for the future

2420
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:36,000
and

2421
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,159
without going in the details they spent

2422
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:39,600
a lot of money

2423
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,199
and decided to go into life expectancy

2424
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:46,000
and they started calico california life

2425
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,520
company which

2426
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,119
uh they then gave them 1.5 billion

2427
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:53,440
dollars to do nothing but

2428
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,159
pure research into

2429
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:59,199
the aging process stopping it and

2430
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:01,440
turning around

2431
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,400
and

2432
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,520
um

2433
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,000
i mean obviously that's a really major

2434
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,280
project

2435
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,159
um

2436
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:09,920
probably more so for me than a lot of

2437
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,679
people in the group because i'm

2438
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:13,440
a lot older than most of the guys in the

2439
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:14,960
group but

2440
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,520
i want to save your life too alan

2441
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,199
oh the world would be worse off without

2442
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:20,639
you

2443
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:22,080
there's so many grandparents that we

2444
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,920
would grieve forever if we couldn't get

2445
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,320
this done quickly

2446
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,159
that's also true

2447
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:29,360
um

2448
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,880
but what's happening since then is the

2449
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,880
all the drug companies that were in

2450
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,280
simple there was a very small but

2451
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:40,560
extremely well well-respected

2452
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,840
project

2453
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:43,679
that showed that

2454
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:44,960
it wasn't even what they were

2455
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,320
researching for but they found it

2456
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,440
uh

2457
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:52,639
putting plasma into people with dementia

2458
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:54,560
plasma from young people

2459
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,520
and they found that actually made

2460
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,440
14 out of the 17 subjects physically

2461
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,600
measurably younger

2462
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,440
and once that came out all the drug

2463
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,239
companies are starting to cancel other

2464
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:11,760
projects and go into life expectancy

2465
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:12,400
so

2466
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,159
that's

2467
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:17,040
in simple what's going on in that field

2468
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,080
and

2469
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,000
a billionaire it takes

2470
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,719
a billion to five billion

2471
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:26,560
uh sometimes six seven to create a new

2472
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:27,440
drug

2473
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,400
in general some they get lucky and do

2474
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,800
obviously less than a billion

2475
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,880
but a billion and a half in pure

2476
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,080
research

2477
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,520
they're going to come up with something

2478
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,760
and they're gonna they're

2479
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,000
they're for all intents and purposes

2480
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:42,719
they're

2481
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,960
what it might call the state of the art

2482
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,520
at this point

2483
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:48,960
and that's

2484
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,719
why i'm asking you

2485
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:52,320
um

2486
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,920
you know like i say it would seem like a

2487
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,679
perfect place

2488
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:57,840
for you to be working because everything

2489
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:58,960
is all

2490
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,639
front end

2491
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:01,679
and

2492
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:03,119
you know you're not dealing with the

2493
01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:05,440
business elements that

2494
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,560
um

2495
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,560
people outside pure research have to

2496
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,040
deal with

2497
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:13,280
yeah i mean that would be really cool to

2498
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:16,000
get a job at calico i can only imagine

2499
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,159
the hiring requirements there would be

2500
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:20,800
pretty steep though

2501
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,719
well i'm not talking about getting a job

2502
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:25,920
there i'm coming from a standpoint of

2503
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,639
what you know what your

2504
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,679
software can do and how it

2505
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:35,199
works whether what can be developed

2506
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:37,919
yeah since they're

2507
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,760
oh sorry uh someone else was saying loki

2508
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:47,199
yeah just since they're trying to look

2509
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:49,840
at it from a new not not a new science

2510
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,760
but a new project right they're going to

2511
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,199
have a lot of data that they need to

2512
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:55,040
sift through and a lot of avenues are

2513
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,639
going to need to go down

2514
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:59,679
yeah absolutely it would be fantastic

2515
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,600
to work with a you know well-resourced

2516
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:04,400
company like that honestly i

2517
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:07,360
i even wonder

2518
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,880
to what extent

2519
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,199
they're not self-sufficient at that

2520
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,159
point

2521
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:13,600
um

2522
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,800
whereas you know a smaller shop

2523
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,760
might need the services more but i mean

2524
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:22,560
that's neither here nor there

2525
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,800
if we could work with calico i mean that

2526
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,800
would be such an opportunity and an

2527
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:27,600
honor

2528
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,520
uh that i i couldn't even begin to

2529
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,520
describe it precisely because of what

2530
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,639
they're looking to do with life

2531
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,800
expectancy

2532
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,080
let me let me assure you all by all all

2533
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,840
companies all face the same thing so the

2534
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,239
things that you highlighted um

2535
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:44,239
you know whether you're a multi-billion

2536
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:46,000
dollar company or a small startup you're

2537
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,920
still going to face those things

2538
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,520
sometimes they could be more pronounced

2539
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,119
in larger companies

2540
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:52,639
larger organizations tend to be

2541
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,000
behemoths and move as such

2542
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,159
oh i just meant that a a large shop will

2543
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:01,520
tend to say

2544
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,360
great idea we'll just try to do it

2545
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,839
ourselves

2546
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,119
rather than trying to

2547
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:11,760
you know work with vendors but again

2548
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,119
that's just my

2549
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:16,000
blind speculation with no mba and zero

2550
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,119
years of

2551
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:20,719
you know business experience so

2552
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,239
well the thing i would see is in pure if

2553
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:29,600
you're doing pure research

2554
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,000
you don't have to

2555
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,320
how can i say you don't have to solve a

2556
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,560
lot of problems that you do when you're

2557
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,719
developing a drug

2558
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,719
you don't have to stop improve

2559
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,320
everything

2560
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:45,280
in the degree that you do

2561
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:46,560
um

2562
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,639
when you're doing you know develop

2563
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:51,360
medical development

2564
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:54,560
yeah that makes a lot of sense um

2565
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,560
it would be really cool like that's

2566
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,040
that's one of the exciting things about

2567
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,600
working with labs rather than firms

2568
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,760
right it's just so much faster and

2569
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,159
looser when you're working closer to the

2570
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:08,560
state of the art because you're nowhere

2571
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:12,080
near a patient um and so

2572
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,520
yeah the drug's kind of wonky but hey at

2573
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,360
least it works let's start working on it

2574
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,600
and improving it that's that's victory

2575
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,600
when you're working in research rather

2576
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,920
than in development

2577
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:30,320
it would be

2578
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,560
tremendously helpful uh

2579
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,639
to if any of you

2580
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:38,960
happen to know anyone in those labs or

2581
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,199
anyone like that um

2582
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:42,639
it doesn't have to even be the size of

2583
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:45,440
calico but if you guys know anyone in

2584
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,159
that space we are very much uh open to

2585
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:50,719
referrals

2586
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,960
well you know uh

2587
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,960
so for the last uh couple three years

2588
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,679
they've had a requirement that anything

2589
01:43:57,679 --> 01:43:59,920
that gets done in that space has to be

2590
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,360
pre-registered

2591
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,440
they've they've stopped allowing people

2592
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,440
to report um

2593
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,480
uh

2594
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:10,239
any kind of test such as the uh

2595
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,320
qualification trials that they have at

2596
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,560
the fda for example those all have to be

2597
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,040
pre-registered so there's a registry

2598
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,800
of all the

2599
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,480
tests and you can just go through all

2600
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,320
the experiments that's been registered

2601
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,639
and you can see which organizations are

2602
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:26,639
doing that and you can see which ones

2603
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:28,480
are most likely to be helped by your

2604
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:31,040
technology uh i will see whether i can

2605
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,199
post that into chat i i tell you i've

2606
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:34,800
been having some trouble with some of my

2607
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:37,280
image links on chat but um i'll try to

2608
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,639
get that one for you the the

2609
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,080
pre-registry

2610
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,320
heck send it to me on linkedin so uh it

2611
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:43,679
doesn't just disappear when the meeting

2612
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:44,880
closes

2613
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,480
