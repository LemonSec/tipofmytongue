1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:10,800
[Laughter]

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:11,750
thank you I thank you so much for having

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,889
me here

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,259
you know the organizers in Kevin Tucker

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,150
had let me know that there was a you

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,460
know a great conference happening here

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,890
and this is my first time at the dojo

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,460
and really enjoying seeing seeing the

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:30,210
ambiance and the the the serve workshop

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,630
atmosphere here so I've titled my talk

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,250
something kind of tongue-in-cheek a

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,620
little provocative everything you know

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,090
is wrong how computering will while

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,169
leading people a beer and during

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:48,120
challenge and a lot of this is some of

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:51,239
my thoughts and and kind of war stories

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,399
from over the last five years or so I've

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,070
been working in Silicon Valley for 20

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,600
years started out my crew my technical

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:03,739
career debugging t1 and t3 lines for a

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,519
ISP that was in a basement

22
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:09,090
non-air-conditioned basement in San

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,470
Francisco and was hands-on for about 15

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,150
years working my way through all the

25
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,039
various parts of the stack and spending

26
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,360
a good long time doing a system

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,960
administration and site reliability

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,170
engineering the last five years I ended

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,009
up going into management at first

30
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,950
kicking and screaming but then

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,420
eventually learning to embrace the but

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,659
the power and the the joy of being able

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,939
to lead others and other teams to

34
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:34,860
fulfill necessary necessary things that

35
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,710
had to happen in security as well as

36
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,420
helped to grow themselves but what I

37
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,669
wanted to talk about today a little bit

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,759
is how a lot of the things that you

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,210
start out and eventually learn to become

40
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,950
a proficient engineer need to be either

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,169
turned on their head or reformulated

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,240
when you move into trying to lead people

43
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,530
it is a very obvious thing of course but

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,919
it's a hard thing to shake off those

45
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:03,600
habits once you're once you're well into

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,930
your profession I took this I took this

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,780
quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes who was

48
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,440
one of our early Supreme Court jurors

49
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,330
I'm saying that the young man

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,690
the rules but the old man knows the

51
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,000
exceptions and have found that I'm

52
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:23,200
probably on a certain a certain side of

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,770
the line now at this point okay so uh

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,320
just grabbing some notes from here but

55
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm I'm gonna start with one of the one

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,769
of the kind of precepts behind being a

57
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,720
great engineer was which is that you're

58
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,050
showing your work not just telling it a

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,370
lot of times one of the things that I

60
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,830
appreciated most about my first mentor

61
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,500
was that we were constantly being asked

62
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,120
to prove what we had done and to show it

63
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,370
in an almost very mathematical way and I

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,440
took that capability or that mindset

65
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,840
into every single job I took afterwards

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:58,030
and it worked well up to that point and

67
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,590
you know this idea of having to being

68
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,290
able to just show your work and being

69
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,820
able to demand that others also rise up

70
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,190
to that same level of technical language

71
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,750
and technical proof was very easy when I

72
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,930
was working around people who had the

73
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,330
same kind of mindset or maybe the same

74
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:16,209
appetite for learning it as as we all

75
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,640
did but it didn't always work when we

76
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,989
were working with folks who were coming

77
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,869
from a different company or a different

78
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,580
company culture shall I say so this idea

79
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,280
of telling your story and being more

80
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,610
verbose or having to go out and set a

81
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,320
narrative was almost I felt almost

82
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,660
allergic to and I first started going

83
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,780
into management but then realized that

84
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,450
it was completely completely essential

85
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,040
in some ways you can see a lot of how

86
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,480
that plays out and the political sphere

87
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,070
and any kind of cause that you care

88
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,380
about the facts are one thing and the

89
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,840
experts know something but the

90
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,910
capability to tell a story that

91
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,340
resonates with people who do not know

92
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,570
the same things that you know is really

93
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,330
really important and it's really

94
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,130
important that people who are experts

95
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,570
and understand the facts are the ones

96
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,780
who are helping to steer that narrative

97
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,820
so I definitely encourage you to you

98
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,330
know look at the full full picture on

99
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,340
these things

100
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,410
I mean when I'm thinking about examples

101
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,390
of what you know where this comes up a

102
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,730
lot you know even in the world of

103
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:19,418
open-source tools you know the

104
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:22,930
prevalence of Linux and and how that

105
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:24,460
emerged you know in in competition in

106
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,630
collaboration with say BSD

107
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,239
right you know I think that's one

108
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,460
example of you know something achieving

109
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,919
a great deal of community mind sure even

110
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,109
while BSD had a great reputation within

111
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,639
the technical community how important it

112
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,470
is to get that kind of ecosystem

113
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,490
footprint and how how much it can

114
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:46,319
determine the end the end result in the

115
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,940
line of the line of systems that I

116
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,069
specialized in DevOps and the DevOps ech

117
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,169
world a lot of the configuration

118
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:54,699
management tools such as you know puppet

119
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:57,880
and chef and cfengine

120
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:59,380
there's a there were a lot of there was

121
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,240
a lot of sort of flag waving around

122
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,280
which ones were the better ones during

123
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,020
the time and you know it may come down

124
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,698
to which has a better set of templates

125
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,469
or which one is in the language that

126
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,360
everyone likes right Ruby was very very

127
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,729
popular for a certain period of time and

128
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,050
then eventually that conversation moves

129
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,840
to the virtualization and container

130
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,240
worlds and at the end of the day a lot

131
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,590
of the fundamentals never really changed

132
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,270
especially in terms of how you're

133
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,479
incorporating security into those layers

134
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,680
of the stack are you looking at the are

135
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,389
you looking at the change where it

136
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,370
originally happened are you looking at

137
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,830
it at each place at which is being

138
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,590
deployed to a new environment are you

139
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,599
tracking where it's actually where it's

140
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,849
actually triggering an event in your

141
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:41,469
production site and those kinds of

142
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:42,759
things those fundamentals didn't really

143
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:45,550
change but a lot of the layers in

144
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:49,719
between did and how people were able to

145
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,639
seer and get buy-in and enthusiasm can

146
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:54,219
often dictate whether or not technology

147
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,400
wins or loses not just the merit of the

148
00:05:54,219 --> 00:06:00,400
technology itself you know in the world

149
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,919
of security and privacy right you know

150
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,859
security has become such such an

151
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,900
essential and hot topic now but I think

152
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,599
that in some ways this is because for

153
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,250
years so much of what security and site

154
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,310
reliability professionals did was

155
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,440
somewhat undervalued and now that the

156
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:20,139
external world is feeling the impact is

157
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,729
now catching up to understand okay what

158
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,740
is this really how much is this really

159
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:26,500
hurting us and what do I need to

160
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:29,560
understand to navigate now so I think

161
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:33,219
that you know being able to tell that

162
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:36,070
story and tell it the right way or early

163
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:36,930
on made a difference also in certain

164
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,639
aspects of

165
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,630
fashion being being a little bit

166
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,100
undervalued here's another one that we'd

167
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,919
like to talk about a lot in technical

168
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,470
circles right don't repeat yourself you

169
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,630
know incorporate whatever logical change

170
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,940
you're doing in one you know in one

171
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,440
central place and from there on things

172
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,120
should be extending or leveraging those

173
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,520
things don't be repetitive and looking

174
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,169
at that compared to you know what a lot

175
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,479
of managers and a lot of leaders end up

176
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:08,008
doing which is you know telling that

177
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,889
story and repeating it and repeating it

178
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,870
in different ways I was reading there

179
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,520
was a quote by Jack Welch in one of his

180
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,289
books about leadership saying that you

181
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,940
know you have to be able to provide a

182
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:19,440
vision and you're gonna be telling your

183
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,030
vision until you're ready to gag on the

184
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,430
words and I thought that was just that

185
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:25,289
just sounded terrible but you know you

186
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,090
know thinking about it more you know the

187
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,590
amount of times it takes for people who

188
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,780
are doing something different than you

189
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,599
to really understand and and just you

190
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,219
know what's important there is it's it

191
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,440
takes a while and it takes there's a

192
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,690
psychological journey people have to go

193
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,130
on along the way you know while I was

194
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,479
doing a little research for this

195
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,840
presentation there was a book written

196
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:50,190
back in 1855 about advertising

197
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,770
I think the fellows name was I think the

198
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,930
fellows name was Tom Smith and he said

199
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,180
something on the lines of it will take

200
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,159
your customer 20 times to hear something

201
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,449
before they're ready to buy it so in a

202
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,370
lot of ways you know coming in and

203
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:05,699
trying to be really concise and terse

204
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,880
and not being to not being too

205
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:10,380
repetitive you have to know what you

206
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,190
have to know what venue it you're in and

207
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,840
what you're trying to accomplish

208
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,370
sometimes you're going to have to turn

209
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,508
some of this logic on its face because

210
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,940
you're trying to reach a new audience

211
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,110
you're trying to bring someone along for

212
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,820
a ride and they're not quite ready yet

213
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,289
and you have to start figuring out how

214
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,330
to break it down so that they can start

215
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,620
hearing really hearing what the benefit

216
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,639
is going to be to them and that's that

217
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,949
takes work on both sides in my own

218
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,709
professional journey what brought me

219
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:37,110
into the DevOps and DevOps suck sort of

220
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:39,149
communities and circles after some

221
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,310
initial resistance was realizing that I

222
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:43,320
was going to company after company

223
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,270
giving the same presentation about

224
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,890
DevOps and configs management and change

225
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,449
management and why was this the same

226
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,220
problem each time

227
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,930
and then I realized the thing that I had

228
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,329
been looking at for more than a decade

229
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,949
and that seems so obvious to me was not

230
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:58,290
going to be obvious to other people

231
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,480
because they hadn't been subject to the

232
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,579
exact same problems or the same the same

233
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,920
experience and so you know at that point

234
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:07,370
I realized that I had to I had to change

235
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:12,360
my own perspective on it in terms of

236
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:14,550
stepping up to communicate another

237
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,740
aspect I think of you know moving around

238
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,449
from managing a technology problem

239
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,190
versus working with people is in

240
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:21,810
especially in small startups we

241
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,579
prioritize speed and just getting it

242
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,138
done you know the result at any cost

243
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:26,790
even if it means burning the midnight

244
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:29,250
oil or burning through your team's

245
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,230
efforts because at the end you know

246
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,000
getting there and winning the result is

247
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,130
more important than anything else in

248
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,690
larger companies and also companies with

249
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,370
a longer ramp you're going to be looking

250
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,459
more at the journey and the destination

251
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,649
because you want to be creating a

252
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:46,380
situation where people can sustain and

253
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,930
the the rules and the the processes can

254
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,389
sustain beyond just that one project and

255
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,800
so you know moving between there's two

256
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:54,449
worlds of you know the folks who are

257
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,890
like really really fast movers and fast

258
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,990
thinkers and maybe a little bit rough

259
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,699
around the edges and then into this

260
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,250
environment where hey actually it's not

261
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,750
always going to be to your benefit to

262
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,980
win every single time what's really

263
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,630
important is also that we're bringing

264
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,880
along certain groups or that we're

265
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,579
bringing other departments along for

266
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,610
this this ride was was also a different

267
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:17,130
kind of inflection point on what what is

268
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,890
important when when you're making a when

269
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:23,459
you're trying to where you're trying to

270
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,529
move the needle on these things in a lot

271
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,290
of in a lot of ways you know thinking

272
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:30,149
back on my last few my last few

273
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,459
important initiatives for companies

274
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:34,170
usually uniting compliance and security

275
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,630
problems and doing a lot of technical

276
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,880
debt catch up I always always made it a

277
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,800
priority for us to make sure we got to

278
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,769
that finish line in terms of whether it

279
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,180
was PCI or IPO readiness or you know

280
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:48,060
making sure we got through that Sox

281
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:51,209
problem but looking back you know I

282
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,489
think that part of what we sometimes

283
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:55,979
missed in the urgency for a done line

284
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,110
was that piece about could people be

285
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,089
working at a sustainable pace were we

286
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,110
building things in in such a way that

287
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,720
the organization

288
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,370
and the rest of the rest of the

289
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,470
technology could continue to do the work

290
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:11,400
after we had maybe moved on to another

291
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:13,920
project would we be able to would we be

292
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,020
show that you know the relationships and

293
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,819
the organization actually got better not

294
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,790
worse because of it and a lot of that

295
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,680
comes back to being able to talk with

296
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,469
people as you're going along on a tough

297
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,939
project and bringing them to bringing

298
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,150
them to understand why it as a priority

299
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,650
and why why they're going to why they're

300
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,569
gonna benefit from it it wasn't enough

301
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,790
just to win and to get the result at the

302
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,500
end of the day it was just as important

303
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,689
to make sure that people understood why

304
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,130
now this ended up being both like for

305
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,560
people's own quality of life and I'll

306
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,030
even say in being able to make sure that

307
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,010
the right people and right departments

308
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,020
got credit for the work if it was not

309
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,610
well understood what was the root

310
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,800
problem in an organization or what was

311
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,840
the root problem why we weren't able to

312
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,550
get vulnerabilities addressed at a

313
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,110
quicker pace or why were people

314
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,079
repeating the same problems over and

315
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,160
over it became very very easy for folks

316
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:07,290
and other departments to you know assign

317
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,620
reasons or cause that may be more

318
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:14,280
debatable so I think that it is it is

319
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,990
very much important to to know that the

320
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:22,920
facts alone aren't always going to be

321
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:25,290
enough another another nice aphorism

322
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,969
that ended up having to flip on its head

323
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,380
was that idea that a premature

324
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,450
optimization was the root of all evil

325
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,340
and I think that was a credit to Donald

326
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:36,600
Knuth and networking in engineering

327
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:38,940
spheres I think we have all experienced

328
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,260
that you know experience that need to

329
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,940
focus and make sure that we're not

330
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,970
working on the wrong thing that we're

331
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,050
not loading code and creating additional

332
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,580
dependencies or security liabilities

333
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:50,760
where they don't need to be and you know

334
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,910
being able to have that laser focus once

335
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,950
started working more with people and the

336
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,959
organization and the teams that mindset

337
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,750
didn't necessarily work as well because

338
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,610
it there is definitely a complete truth

339
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,470
to the idea that you have to build the

340
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,690
relationship before something is needed

341
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,130
from it people are more like people are

342
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,010
growing entities right they need to be

343
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:13,620
felt feel taken care of and fed and

344
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,800
watered beyond just what I need for this

345
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,089
particular transaction

346
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,219
this moment and I think in the work

347
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:20,649
world sometimes especially with a lot of

348
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:27,790
urgent deadlines this can become very

349
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:29,560
easy to forget and I think some of the

350
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,399
some of the things that people look at

351
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,739
in terms of what you know they consider

352
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,540
a waste of time in terms of you know

353
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,610
there's meeting without an agenda or you

354
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,959
know I'm having to you know form these

355
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,399
relationships with all these folks that

356
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,619
you know I don't know why yet

357
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,930
especially in organizations where you're

358
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,000
trying to you're trying to get security

359
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,709
to be proactive not just reactive this

360
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,110
becomes extra important you know being

361
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:54,518
curious and interested in knowing why

362
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,170
are the problems occurring where they're

363
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:58,079
occurring why are there some unexpected

364
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,699
things happening in certain places and

365
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,729
why do some people have certain concerns

366
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,110
that pop up in in places that you just

367
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,940
wouldn't expect all of these things

368
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,380
become very very relevant down the line

369
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,510
as you're trying to either troubleshoot

370
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,899
a major issue or sometimes things that

371
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:22,450
become become unexpected issues down the

372
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:24,160
road and of course I think one of my one

373
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,010
of my favorite lessons from having

374
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,810
worked at the large retailers was

375
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,880
something that one of my mentors told me

376
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,290
when we were discussing why was it so

377
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,240
hard to get the different departments to

378
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:38,290
coordinate why was it so hard to get

379
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,899
silos you know to reach apart in terms

380
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,699
of the development and operation piece I

381
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:44,860
think on the engineering side of course

382
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,270
we get very very used to making sure

383
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,440
that we can prove everything that we're

384
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,250
saying and that we were empirically

385
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,779
right but the fundamental point that

386
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,450
that I think that was the takeaway for

387
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:56,709
me was not to force logic into emotion

388
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,959
and this idea that it is a different

389
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:02,229
dimension of problem at that point and

390
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,609
when I saw that I realized like when we

391
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,740
would have get into an argument with

392
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,770
such and such team because they were

393
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,140
they didn't want us to let's say for

394
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,209
example that it was we were moving into

395
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,100
an area where we were doing more asset

396
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,349
management which I would think would be

397
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,880
a plus for the organization maybe

398
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,709
another organization would be not that

399
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,420
happy about it and we'd under in a

400
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,729
conversation and I wouldn't understand

401
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,990
initially why it was so charged once I

402
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,040
stepped away from it for a little while

403
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,110
I realized it's not about enough

404
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,849
thoroughly the logical win-win in front

405
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,800
of them there is a reaction to something

406
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,350
some perception of something being taken

407
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,269
away that needs to be addressed even

408
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,370
before we can have a really rational

409
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:43,730
discussion about how best to make this

410
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:47,480
problem solved for the company and when

411
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:49,579
when I backed off of that that concept

412
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,100
that we had to we had to approach it

413
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,660
completely on that side of hey you know

414
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,949
we just need to put this in terms of an

415
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,019
argument the other side is going to

416
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:59,540
understand and try stuff into like okay

417
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:01,699
what are the things that this group are

418
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,709
reacting against and that where there

419
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:05,300
might be a little bit of there might be

420
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,369
a little bit of history there that

421
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,769
changed the equation in a lot of ways in

422
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,529
terms of being able to work beyond just

423
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:32,779
the just what was the immediate problem

424
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:35,720
at the time yeah that's right yes sure

425
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,370
sure so I think you know the I'm a

426
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,500
believer that the the roots of a

427
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,880
solution are in the the seeds to a

428
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,250
solution er and the roots of the problem

429
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,779
so what you just described okay so I'm

430
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,949
talking to a developer and saying hey

431
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:47,779
you know you've got a really high

432
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:49,790
proportion of these kinds of bugs and

433
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:53,569
they're getting offended understanding

434
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:55,099
okay this person has like they want to

435
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:57,649
believe that either they don't make that

436
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,459
many they don't make that many bugs or

437
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:04,459
that they are having someone else bring

438
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:07,520
it to them is an issue and so I think

439
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:09,230
that you know part of it is part of it

440
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,379
in that kind of situation is to let them

441
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,929
know that hey this is not this is not

442
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,610
that unusual necessarily and so

443
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:18,679
therefore this is just part of part of

444
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,389
what we're doing as a development this

445
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,100
is just part of being an engineer

446
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,319
needing to be better you don't have to

447
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:25,938
take it personally but I think when

448
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,829
you're seeing someone react let's say

449
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:29,600
with ego first right you know I think

450
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,740
it's stepping back to say like okay is

451
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,719
this something that we can work with

452
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:36,320
here and this is where you have to use

453
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,460
all of your both relationship and and EQ

454
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,168
skills about like is this something we

455
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,870
can work with in terms of getting them

456
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:43,210
to understand this is you

457
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,610
just something you can get better at you

458
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,290
know like our former speaker who was up

459
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,530
here with saying the knowledge piece can

460
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:52,659
be taught right if it's something where

461
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,370
it's maybe a little bit more entrenched

462
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:59,770
and you know I've encountered that as

463
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:02,919
well sometimes I took two approaches

464
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:06,580
right let's say for an instance we were

465
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,860
we were having issues getting a getting

466
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,330
a remote manager to agree to some things

467
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,928
that we all knew that the company needed

468
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,830
and I you know and I could see that

469
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:19,870
there was a lot of there was a lot of

470
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:22,360
investment in this idea that you know

471
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,590
the way that this person wanted to do it

472
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,919
was a higher standard than everybody

473
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:29,290
else's so therefore he had totally dug

474
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,840
in his heels about not not bending on

475
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:35,080
that standard we had to approach it from

476
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,879
the perspective of from a managerial

477
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,428
standpoint there was we definitely had

478
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,730
to work with his manager as well and

479
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:44,530
have a recent conversation about hey you

480
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,450
know here's our alternatives you know

481
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:49,540
help us pick which one is going to be

482
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:52,330
the best here and also picking the

483
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,520
battles kind of aspect like I don't have

484
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,409
any kind of illusion that there's going

485
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,080
to be perfect results to this it's just

486
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,760
people trying to grow and grow the org

487
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:12,149
at the same time as you go but I think

488
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:12,150
you do yeah that's right

489
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,178
that's right yeah

490
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,419
make them part of the solution that's

491
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:24,490
always a little bit better and I totally

492
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:26,200
you know his manager as well was there

493
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,570
to say like hey you know if we don't

494
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,240
make a choice that's unacceptable so we

495
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,620
must make a choice you know so I think

496
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,210
that combination of things kind of

497
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,299
helped get us around the bend on that

498
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:46,539
particular issue but you know definitely

499
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:52,090
there's you know it's yeah yeah that's

500
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:53,500
right that's right I mean absolutely if

501
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,049
he takes pride in the quality of his

502
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,059
coding it takes pride in being let's say

503
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:59,379
you know the best developer one of the

504
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:01,539
most professional developers in that

505
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,750
work helped give him more tools to be

506
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:06,879
that person right and I think especially

507
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,710
the security being so interesting and so

508
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,270
critical nowadays there's a lot of ways

509
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,250
to bring people into the fold in that

510
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,950
respect you know more and more in these

511
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,600
days you know and you all probably

512
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,149
experienced this too you know people

513
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,189
approaching our our teams myself asking

514
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:22,570
how to get into security what should

515
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,690
they be learning about and this and that

516
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:28,178
and so I think in that way you know the

517
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,799
folks who the folks who you're actually

518
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:31,750
engaging with and you can get a reaction

519
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,010
from you have you have a chance they're

520
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,100
the problems are like where you have

521
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,899
like silos or no response you know I

522
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,059
think if you can at least get a reaction

523
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:42,760
from someone because they have some kind

524
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:45,720
of they have some kind of investment in

525
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,720
it there's a shot

526
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,178
so I I kind of a put put the slide here

527
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,610
at the end because one of the things

528
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:01,870
that I found when you know kind of

529
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,178
switching back and forth between the

530
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,799
technical and the the people aspect of

531
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,929
it is sometimes just having too refined

532
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,850
footing because you know turning those

533
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:13,480
those ideas of like whatever it was that

534
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:15,789
you I felt made me a good engineer into

535
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,559
something else I would have to come back

536
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:19,059
and say okay like where am I on this and

537
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,879
where you know what's the situation and

538
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:23,740
I I think what the message I want to

539
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,770
give is that there is a path through in

540
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,380
terms of finding finding a center you

541
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:32,918
know finding a place that you can work

542
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,929
from that still is has integrity to you

543
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,049
as an engineer but allows you to grow

544
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:40,000
other people but it does require

545
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:42,309
constantly adjusting constantly being on

546
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,620
your toes and knowing who you're working

547
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,330
with and so I think bringing that into

548
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,760
the fold and understanding that there's

549
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,980
a progression to how everyone is is

550
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,140
learning as as engineers and as other

551
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,760
managers that they gradually become more

552
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,429
informed they gradually became more

553
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:01,480
flexible kind of helps that process

554
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:03,520
along and those are the the major the

555
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,919
major kind of points that I wanted to

556
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,559
talk about today in terms of you know

557
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,460
what I felt had to be changed between

558
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,440
those between those worlds if if anybody

559
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,820
has any other questions or any kinds of

560
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,700
stories they'd like to share from their

561
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:41,168
own experiences I'd I'd welcome hearing

562
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:43,799
them sure depends on the the area right

563
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:45,909
like so for the DevOps and

564
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,470
infrastructure and tooling and all that

565
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:50,559
kind of stuff I do like all their DevOps

566
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,659
groups and DevOps Enterprise has been

567
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,720
has been a great contact source as well

568
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:57,429
I think you know you go in there and

569
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,679
what's great is you know you can go in

570
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:02,110
with a problem and then as you're as

571
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,279
you're working with other folks who have

572
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,959
the same problems you guys can come up

573
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,940
with the solutions together too

574
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,039
state the obvious but you know you start

575
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,120
out with you start out with a little bit

576
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,480
of uncertainty and then end up moving

577
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,770
moving into late into better places for

578
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,049
application security of course the OWASP

579
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:19,389
the Hoth stuff is a good place to start

580
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:23,799
I really like some of the stuff that I'm

581
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:26,080
seeing with that a was the secure

582
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:27,520
developer and you know Shannon Lee it's

583
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,980
over it intuitive been talking about

584
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,379
adversary focused application of

585
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,289
security as opposed to just the captain

586
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,360
which are obviously very important also

587
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:39,129
I think those two things plus like a

588
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,760
good knowledge of threat modeling and

589
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:44,950
internal actual internal you know

590
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,870
threats and weaknesses would be a decent

591
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:52,330
way to go about that

592
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:53,830
and you know I obviously you know Bruce

593
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,580
Schneier is vlog is always a good one to

594
00:23:53,830 --> 00:24:01,658
resource I try to like find I try to

595
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:11,470
find where I think the most most

596
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:15,290
specific experts are oh I didn't say

597
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:17,190
that but that's a it is a good thought

598
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,460
[Laughter]

599
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,409
yeah

600
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,880
I would say most of my career has been

601
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:23,860
focused on the blue team side of it

602
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,169
coming up from infrastructure and all

603
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,469
that and so that's been that's been the

604
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:28,470
aspect
