1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,620
doesn't need introduction he's very well

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:11,519
known in the community black patch

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:15,989
winner deaf no more I mean this guy is

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,119
like in the community I see some work

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,400
and then some stuff on us and this is

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,580
going to be like a hands-on hockey talk

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,470
so I can't wait to see it so this

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,299
gentleman this again it's how he has

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,029
helped me a lot of this part of our

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,779
group and I'm thankful because he came

11
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,059
up today

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:42,090
and show off it's gonna give his talk so

13
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:42,780
please join me in welcoming Sam oh all

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,460
right folks

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,950
well I just want to show you some stuff

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,910
I'm just going to tell you a lot of

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,440
horror stories really and see if I can

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,648
figure out yeah it might work alright so

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,180
I teach at City College San Francisco

20
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,829
and if you want these slides or anything

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,070
they're there at Sam's class not info

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,870
but my point here is that the current

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,990
state of cryptography is appallingly bad

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,369
for no good reason the math is good but

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,460
the actual practice of it is

26
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,189
ridiculously stupid for no good reason

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,339
ha I see everyone agrees Andy and the

28
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,139
the reason my personal theory is of

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,580
course I'm in education so I swear I see

30
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,220
I think it's because we have bad math

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,658
teachers and I'm around third grade and

32
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,070
traumatized kids so they get this

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,330
feeling that math is horrible and

34
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,939
they'll never look at it again

35
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,310
and that is not justified math is not

36
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,389
impossible it's not that hard but it is

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,670
amazing house how many people just don't

38
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,500
look at what they're doing so let's um

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,299
security theaters a term as far as I

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,860
know it came from Bruce Schneier where

41
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,110
he pointed out there's an awful lot of

42
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,880
cases where people do something just to

43
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:53,399
look like they're security when there

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,000
isn't like for example the TSA 9 9/11

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,290
happened

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,450
terrorists knocked down a bunch of

47
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,040
airplanes everybody got afraid so nobody

48
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,170
would get on the planes so the

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,060
government in a covert bailout move

50
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,460
created this giant institution to

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,098
pretend to make this airplanes more safe

52
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,929
and yet when they test these with

53
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,000
penetration test they get people to try

54
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,180
to sneak a gun onto a plane

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,100
and their chance of success is 98% so

56
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,420
these guys do not actually stop any

57
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,519
weapons from getting on the plane they

58
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,350
are only there to make the customers

59
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,900
feel like someone has made the plane

60
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,700
safer which they haven't in many ways

61
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,110
that Cymbeline nearly obvious one thing

62
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,700
Bruce tire pointed out is they spend

63
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,290
most of their time trying to verify your

64
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,959
identity and figure out who you are and

65
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:37,109
he said you know I don't care who you

66
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,200
are I just care if you have a bomb why

67
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,120
do they care who you are and anyway it's

68
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,399
this is a security theater and I don't

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,050
mean to say it's completely useless now

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,459
this does have certain effects that

71
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,410
might be beneficial and they saved the

72
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,209
American airline industry because

73
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,829
there's a strange thing in American

74
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,690
culture that Americans are like small

75
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,670
children and have no guts and they want

76
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,989
someone to lie to them the British have

77
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,760
a different theory they say yes the

78
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,260
plane might fall down shut up and get on

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,720
the plane they just have a different

80
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,179
attitude yes there's risk in life be an

81
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,410
adult and take a risk but Americans

82
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,840
don't like it that way they want to be

83
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,140
lied to and told there is no risk anyway

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,459
so I started teaching hacking let's turn

85
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,018
out to be a long time ago I didn't

86
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,580
realize is ten years ago I taught this

87
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,010
course for the first time so I read this

88
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,780
book acting exposed and I went through

89
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,310
here and in this hacking exposed book

90
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,299
they had a description of this Cisco VPN

91
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,030
encrypted password now if you had a

92
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,580
Cisco VPN concentrator it had this

93
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,560
config file and look at that password it

94
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,780
goes three whole lines of junk across

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,060
the screen it's marked encrypted group

96
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,820
password so obviously nobody could read

97
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,410
that password so people would just put

98
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,060
these things on public servers all over

99
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,709
the place so you can easily find the

100
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,510
filing you need because obviously

101
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,790
there's no risk at doing that and that

102
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,380
is not encrypted this is horrible this

103
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,750
is my introduction to the world of

104
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,190
cryptography theater um these things are

105
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,049
everywhere so I went on the web and

106
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,340
searched for him when Google and I found

107
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,590
a bunch of them I found the Kaiser

108
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,660
Permanente password file up there with

109
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,640
the encrypted group password - and then

110
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,140
I found out it's not encrypted at all

111
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,940
there's just a one-to-one translation

112
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,640
you don't even have to crack it it's

113
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:16,290
just scrambled in some stupid way I

114
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,130
found earlier today a bunch of are still

115
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,049
on the web this

116
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,969
that was like a 25 character random

117
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:27,150
password obviously somebody thinks that

118
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,830
is secure and instead they're publishing

119
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,388
on the web without knowing that so I

120
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,400
found this for Kaiser Permanente and

121
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,199
what told people I've made friend of a

122
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,049
friend so someone would tell them and I

123
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,169
got a response back which was this that

124
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,150
password is not a security boundary

125
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:45,750
which I thought is is a kind of epic

126
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,400
statement but anyway nobody cared but I

127
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,780
cared and I said well there's various

128
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,888
things that bother me here one is the

129
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,809
inability to disclose any

130
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,789
vulnerabilities and the fact that people

131
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,789
just lie when you talk to them and the

132
00:04:53,789 --> 00:05:00,330
other thing that's very strange is what

133
00:04:55,789 --> 00:05:02,460
brain process let anybody to do this to

134
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,740
make something that says it's encrypted

135
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,169
and looks encrypted and is not encrypted

136
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,180
what exactly did anybody think they were

137
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,979
accomplishing by doing this and this is

138
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,880
my main point here I think there is a

139
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:17,789
gigantic psychological flaw in

140
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,250
technology where people are so terrified

141
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:22,469
of mathematics that they think all they

142
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,960
can do is make something that will look

143
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,849
to their boss as if they have encrypted

144
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,620
it and then hopefully run away before

145
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:30,240
they notice that seems to be the

146
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,860
standard practice people do instead of

147
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,139
encrypting things I used to be in the

148
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,050
ipv6 task force and the same thing true

149
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,550
of ipv6 the number one way to achieve

150
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,470
ipv6 compatibility is to just take your

151
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,979
product and put a label on it says ipv6

152
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,720
and sell it that way anyway so I'm so

153
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:48,960
this is cryptography theater and this is

154
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,370
what good it is and it's amazing how

155
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,859
much in the unit how much the stuff we

156
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,330
use it has fake cryptography in it it's

157
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,580
sort of like fake news it's sort of

158
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,530
mind-blowing this technical term for

159
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,180
this is obfuscation where you scramble

160
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,770
things so it's a little bit hard to read

161
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,060
but you haven't really hidden it in any

162
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,948
way that prevents anybody from reading

163
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,120
it things like Pig Latin and such

164
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,789
techniques um

165
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,210
and it's everywhere like Microsoft in

166
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:13,590
the Windows registry if you the programs

167
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,510
you have most recently launched are

168
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,859
stored in the registry in case you want

169
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:21,260
to launch them again but you protect

170
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,260
your privacy Microsoft scrambles them

171
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,659
that is scrambled with the mighty rot13

172
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,910
which is simpler than the Captain Crunch

173
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:33,690
decoder ring

174
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:37,140
um you move every letter forward 13 the

175
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:40,500
alphabet so PUA bzr is Chrome

176
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,940
and this is 64 and that's Microsoft is

177
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,820
still using this in the latest version

178
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,710
of the operating system and I think it

179
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,540
shows some gigantic psychological

180
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,609
problem why would anybody ever do this

181
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,440
how could you possibly think you are

182
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,080
accomplishing anything by doing this I

183
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,450
mean either you don't care and you just

184
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,159
put it in plain text or you do care and

185
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,870
you encrypt it what do you possibly

186
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,510
think you are accomplishing with this

187
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,610
nonsense it's mind-boggling except

188
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,630
humiliating yourself exposing to the

189
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,610
world that you're an idiot

190
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,740
is the only thing this does anyway um

191
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,800
and that everything is this way it's

192
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,140
amazing Android apps if you want to just

193
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,700
sink into a cesspool of stupidity

194
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,340
there's nothing to compare it with

195
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,650
Android um

196
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,849
obvious blindingly obvious that people

197
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,409
don't write their apps and they don't

198
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:27,120
audit their apps they just go for the

199
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,600
lowest bidder which is always outsourced

200
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,770
to one of about three countries three

201
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,720
developers and foreign countries that

202
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,729
just copy their previous thing and ship

203
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,190
it off and it's all full of fake

204
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,420
cryptography more than like 80% of the

205
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,830
ones I went through hundreds of Android

206
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,360
apps or the largest companies and most

207
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,969
important companies I could find and

208
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,700
it's all crap it's amazing it's great

209
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,680
failed for attackers but so I'd like to

210
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,020
TD Ameritrade app let's take a look at

211
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,630
this this one is actually my fault or

212
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,060
you could look at it that way I went to

213
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:00,840
GTD serves my accumulated android and

214
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,100
I've got it going through Burke and but

215
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,010
for this I don't even need to go through

216
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,370
a burp I should have TD Ameritrade and

217
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:11,460
your TD Ameritrade alright let's go to

218
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:15,180
all my apps I have an Okie here's the TD

219
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,070
Ameritrade app now um what I did was I

220
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,600
went through I went to a talk at a conic

221
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,030
this a couple years ago and a guy had

222
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,470
bought an Android tablet and he given

223
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,119
his little girl about two or three years

224
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,130
old games to play on the Android tablet

225
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,810
and they were too hard he said well I

226
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,610
wonder if I could make that game easier

227
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,350
how bad would it be and he showed me how

228
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,330
he he demonstrated how to make a game

229
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,640
how to hack a game and it's incredibly

230
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,950
easy Android apps become a source code

231
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,360
in Java for all practical purposes it's

232
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,070
technically and Smyly but it looks just

233
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,690
like Java you can just modify it and

234
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,320
change them so you can slow things down

235
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,970
I said

236
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,290
that's really exciting it's so much

237
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,690
easier than having to go into like

238
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,640
compiled binary and Ida Pro or anything

239
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,380
and so I said well I wonder if I could

240
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,120
do that to a bank apps and you totally

241
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,070
can the Bank of America app I did first

242
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,960
you can totally unpack it read it find

243
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,610
the password make a Trojan version that

244
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,170
prints out the password and it still

245
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,840
connects to the bank of America servers

246
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,620
and works just fine and I said this is

247
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,260
not good

248
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,750
I looked and that's the m10 in the OWASP

249
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,670
top 10 mobile allowing you to modify an

250
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,680
app and keep using it is a security

251
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,390
vulnerability and by the way some

252
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,800
companies that care about security have

253
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,780
prevented this the main one being the

254
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,550
NFL the National Football League app

255
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,189
which he used to buy tickets and jerseys

256
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,780
was humiliated publicly for sending

257
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,640
plaintext password encryption so they

258
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,290
made their app secure and it is far more

259
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,080
secure than any of the top ten banks

260
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,790
insurance brokers or investment

261
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,530
companies now it's one of the most

262
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:38,459
secure apps in Android which is not

263
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,660
saying much but anyway um so I tested

264
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,250
and almost all of them are vulnerable to

265
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,110
this attack where you can modify it and

266
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,150
make a Trojan app that steals your

267
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,920
password and I notified all the banks

268
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,090
and they mostly didn't care and none of

269
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,400
them could talk to me a few of them

270
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,960
snuck up to me secretly at besides in

271
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,040
Vegas and said you know you should Bank

272
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,690
of America I said you should shut up

273
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,699
stop picking on us I said well you're

274
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,980
gonna fix it you said no I said well

275
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,120
then we got a problem but other people

276
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,410
said they were gonna fix it like Wells

277
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,210
Fargo and stuff but all of them said you

278
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,410
can't tell anybody my name and they can

279
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,300
never know that we went to a horrible

280
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,890
thing like b-sides and polluted our

281
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:12,689
corporate name by attending a bunch of

282
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:14,130
evil hackers so anyway um it's so I TD

283
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,690
Ameritrade is one of the companies I

284
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,150
notified and see what I did in the first

285
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,770
thing was I modified their app so it

286
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,900
would put a copy of the password in the

287
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,550
log which is a horrible thing to do it's

288
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,170
the syslog it's available to every part

289
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,030
of the device and I've send it to them

290
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,680
as my proof look your app has a problem

291
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,110
someone controlling it here it is

292
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,569
stealing the password so TD Ameritrade

293
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:36,660
responded by changing their app to put

294
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:40,320
the password in the log so they really

295
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,180
got it all backwards and so next time I

296
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,540
they modified the app i looks all the

297
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,310
update and when i tested it it was now

298
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,680
making two copies of the password in the

299
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:52,819
log so that caught my attention so it's

300
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,930
library Android the SDK platform tools

301
00:10:52,820 --> 00:11:01,270
okay so here's the log

302
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:07,060
let me make my window big okay so if i

303
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:11,079
run this adb logcat come on this is the

304
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:13,510
syslog on the o adb yeah Android debug

305
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,520
bridge okay that's the log my Android

306
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,319
device that's the live log showing

307
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,060
whatever the developers and the

308
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,360
operating system people wanted to log so

309
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,699
now I launch TD Ameritrade zap and it's

310
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,779
asked me to agree to something yeah sure

311
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:31,029
okay now I can login so I'm not logged

312
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:34,750
in yes I hit login there we go

313
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:38,230
I'd like to try again oh I know why

314
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,910
pardon me I've got to bypass my proxy no

315
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,600
I don't that's another problem but we'll

316
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:51,640
get there later so so here I am complete

317
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:53,860
idiots and secrets password and when you

318
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:58,000
log it it'll put it right in a log let

319
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:00,910
me see if we can spot it here if not

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,740
I'll have to use grep to find it looks

321
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:07,860
like perhaps too many things were gone

322
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:14,920
by let's try this pipe idiots

323
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:16,420
grep it was alright and didn't find it

324
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,890
alright maybe it updated my app I'm not

325
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,170
going to struggle with my live demo

326
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,970
I saw it trying to update my app and I

327
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,040
mean I think I might have failed to

328
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,320
block the update but anyway put it right

329
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,819
in the log before your name and password

330
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,800
go in plain text right in a log because

331
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,390
that was apparently what they got out of

332
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,150
my felling ability disclosure was oh we

333
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,350
better do that so when I Trojan it again

334
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,760
there were two copies of user name and

335
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,459
password in a log but then they took

336
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,100
that out again so at least they're not

337
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:44,199
ignoring me I guess so this was pretty

338
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,610
good too Mayo Clinic medical transport

339
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,290
and this is still true of the very

340
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,390
latest version from this guy named wolf

341
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,480
apps that makes about eight or ten

342
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:55,630
Android apps and they all work the same

343
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,660
way so I don't know why they even do

344
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,520
this it's more example of strange

345
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,170
thinking but there is this thing you can

346
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,350
get in the App Store called the Mayo

347
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:08,889
Clinic medical app and it should be on

348
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:12,369
here yeah MC

349
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:14,619
Mt Mayo Clinic medical transport this I

350
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:16,689
think is an app that people have EMTs

351
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:18,309
have in ambulances to look up

352
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:21,160
information about medical things it's

353
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:22,749
got a password and so if you look at the

354
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,988
website where it comes from it tells you

355
00:13:22,749 --> 00:13:28,209
only official people can use this app it

356
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:29,949
is password protected passwords cannot

357
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:32,018
be given out except by some special

358
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:33,579
process so instead of just distributing

359
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,319
the app by email or something only to

360
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,669
their employees they put it in a public

361
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:38,949
store so everybody can get it

362
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:41,679
but that's okay because it's password

363
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:43,358
protected well you might say it's

364
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,119
password protected but all you have to

365
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:50,589
do is suck the app off the phone with

366
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:52,600
adb shell and then unpack it with

367
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:54,699
apktool an open source product and look

368
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,589
at the source code and the password is

369
00:13:54,699 --> 00:14:01,479
just right there called secret password

370
00:13:56,589 --> 00:14:02,919
it's and so you know this is uh so then

371
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,879
I tried it it worked and by the way I

372
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,499
couldn't figure out how to get the

373
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,389
source code of the iOS app but it's the

374
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:09,549
same password so I told the developer

375
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:11,109
years ago and he told me quit sending me

376
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,209
this junk just shut up and now it's

377
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:14,889
still up there and I'm surprised that

378
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:16,388
people like the Mayo Clinic don't care

379
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,739
an extra security conference I went you

380
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,999
the Mayo Clinic was sponsoring him they

381
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:20,199
were there I thought they might punch me

382
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:22,509
in the face but I don't think they care

383
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:24,609
or no but anyway um so I thought that

384
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,589
was kind of amazing and then there's

385
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,290
this one gene EMD and this is also true

386
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:31,209
of the very latest version jeanny md is

387
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,429
a medical app you can send your symptoms

388
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:35,018
up to your doctor and stuff like that

389
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:38,488
make appointments and junk like that

390
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:43,540
and it's IBM and Harvard or on this and

391
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:45,850
this thing breaks SSL so if I go to I'm

392
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:51,759
running my phone through Burke here's

393
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:54,339
all kinds of connections and if I go to

394
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:58,569
the browser I should be able to see a

395
00:14:54,339 --> 00:15:01,239
warning here here's the browser okay so

396
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:08,769
here's my unsecured page if I go to a

397
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:13,539
secure page like this one okay let's see

398
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:16,119
what I get in my burp your burp okay I

399
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:17,559
ought to get some kind of error message

400
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:18,910
it may not be showing it but it's

401
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,199
refusing to mate connection anyway

402
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,759
because I'm man in the middle English

403
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,449
stuff through Burke and you're not

404
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,510
supposed to be

405
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,220
to do that and in fact let me go to a

406
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,930
secure app there was a bank that came

407
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,180
and gave a talk at my class like a week

408
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,319
ago and so I immediately said well let

409
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,029
me look at their Android app because I

410
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,470
asked them what do you do if I've only

411
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:37,810
really reported so we take it very

412
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,820
seriously I said why thank you so let's

413
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,349
see if your idroid app is crap so I

414
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,029
brought up their Android app and their

415
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,339
Android app is the best I've ever seen

416
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,630
it actually does certificate pinning and

417
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:47,980
it actually works I've never seen

418
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,529
anybody else even try it

419
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,959
nobody banks insurance companies people

420
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,070
that should care yet noticed there's

421
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,839
something wrong with that certificate

422
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,279
because I got Burke the head in the

423
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,630
middle in traffic and there's something

424
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,339
ridiculously wrong with the certificate

425
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,439
is signed by ports wygor totally

426
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:04,899
untrusted this is the only app I've ever

427
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,279
found that is smart enough to correctly

428
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,110
analyze that and give you a good error

429
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,899
message although a few others do block

430
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,519
traffic anyway um I think I saw another

431
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:17,800
one somewhere I did it but anyway that's

432
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:22,149
let's go to those Jeannie MD ones and

433
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:24,189
here you are Harvard health so Harvard

434
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:29,920
health is here I can sign in to Harvard

435
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:35,459
health I can say trusting user and

436
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:39,189
secret password I can sign in and

437
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:41,140
Harvard health tells me that something's

438
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,390
wrong which is it's going to eventually

439
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,250
tell me that my password is wrong which

440
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,720
is a very very bad thing to tell me

441
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,410
because it should not be able to get my

442
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,209
password up to the server but it does it

443
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,130
sends my password through burps eerily

444
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:55,630
through a fake HTTP certificate without

445
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,209
complaining at all now this is not a

446
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,740
small thing the whole point of HTTPS is

447
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,699
it supposed to encrypt stuff and is

448
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,589
supposed to make sure that you're

449
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:05,740
sending it to the right server that was

450
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:08,919
the whole point and so I told them and

451
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,900
this by the way is so it bad that the

452
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,829
FTC actually sued a few companies for

453
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:16,900
this um so I told them in 2014 that this

454
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:18,579
was a problem this app they published a

455
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,839
list of all the apps they notified so

456
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,760
the first one I tried to do an Android

457
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,260
security first thing it was recheck the

458
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,970
apps that cert had already complained

459
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,679
about to see if they passed it and then

460
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,390
I tried the others and I expected to

461
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,040
find that everybody to be notified it

462
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,480
fixed it and nobody else was vulnerable

463
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,240
and that's not what I found at all

464
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,980
because the cert test was very cursory

465
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,430
and if you test manual you find a bunch

466
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,320
of

467
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,450
vulnerable apps that search did not find

468
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,370
and almost everybody just ignored the

469
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,810
cert warning and I said man I'm used to

470
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,820
them ignoring me but when they're

471
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,919
ignoring search that's pretty dumb but

472
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,629
here's I acted him here I published the

473
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,160
article about this medical apps that

474
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,600
violate HIPAA by sending medical data

475
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,250
without encryption without proper

476
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,659
encryption and I got a response from

477
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,610
them which said a patient is not a

478
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,070
covered entity under HIPAA so that's

479
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,870
good clean fun if we write an app that

480
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,240
patients use to send their medical data

481
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,110
to their doctor and it's unsafe and by

482
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,750
the way a lot of them don't use

483
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,939
encryption at all that's legal

484
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,220
apparently I said well I still feel like

485
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,870
you shouldn't be doing it but anyway

486
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,490
apparently it's legal and so they don't

487
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,060
care and Harvard doesn't care and nobody

488
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,590
cares

489
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,350
they're cheerfully putting their name on

490
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:22,629
this garbage and I'm kind of surprised

491
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,490
you know I would think IBM or Harvard or

492
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:28,180
somebody would not let their reputation

493
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,160
on this app but it's been years I told

494
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,200
them and cert told them and they don't

495
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,150
care so it's an interesting world here's

496
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,730
the lawsuit Fandango and Credit Karma

497
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,600
did this they broke HTTPS certificates

498
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:42,010
so that they would take a fake one and

499
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,149
sued them and said look your Terms of

500
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,100
Service says you take reasonable

501
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,260
measures to protect the privacy and

502
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,580
security of your customers and this does

503
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,730
not fit in that category and they

504
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,139
punished them for that in 2014 but

505
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,320
apparently it's okay to send medical

506
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,670
data this way um anyway so then I

507
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,860
started looking at what else they do on

508
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:03,340
phones with more outrageous nonsense um

509
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,139
so when you log into something on your

510
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,030
phone some commercial app you remembers

511
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,290
who you are well you don't have to keep

512
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,270
typing in your password all the time

513
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,920
which is of course very normal so how

514
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,780
would it remember who you are let's look

515
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,230
at somebody did it right which is target

516
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,700
um after I do all the medical the banks

517
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,440
insurance companies and stockbrokers I

518
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,210
just went through the top retailers and

519
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,900
so I happen to fiend target it's

520
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,520
actually pretty good

521
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,660
here's Target Australia for some reason

522
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,610
that's the one I found easier to work

523
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,410
with and so target Australia you're

524
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:35,229
putting this app and then when you log

525
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:37,210
in it sends your usually but it sends it

526
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,610
over HTTP and it does verify the

527
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,250
certificates so that's okay and after

528
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,889
you login it sends back from the server

529
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,420
a cookie with this long random number in

530
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,890
it and that's how it knows you are now

531
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,870
every time you log in is since some

532
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,320
cookie which does not contain your

533
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,199
username

534
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,189
or your password up to the server and

535
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,509
therefore it knows who you are this is

536
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,399
the right way to do it this is what

537
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:59,320
every browser does people figured out

538
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:01,299
years ago your browser doesn't save the

539
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,980
password it saves a cookie and the

540
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:05,710
cookie is just a long random number that

541
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,380
does not contain any secrets I did not

542
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,090
think this was exciting new information

543
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,630
but apparently the Android developers

544
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,590
are not aware of this um so that is one

545
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,720
of the few people will do it right

546
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,480
staples is a fine example of how not to

547
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,669
do it so I got the staples app you

548
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,200
download this thing and once you get it

549
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:24,970
then take a look at the local storage

550
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,580
and you find something called encrypted

551
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,960
passwords stored in the data section of

552
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,389
the staples app on your Android phone

553
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,779
which is not good but you wonder what is

554
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:33,758
that

555
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:35,529
are they really storing the password no

556
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,159
one would be that stupid well that's

557
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,080
what they do

558
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,789
so I found a website telling you how to

559
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,649
do this and it's I thought it was okay

560
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:43,269
here's here's the best way to do this

561
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:45,370
how do you store a password in your app

562
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:47,440
you don't what are you an idiot you

563
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,418
store cookie that's the best way why do

564
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,269
what you need to store a copy of

565
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:53,740
someone's password anyway if you do

566
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:55,570
though there's a thing you had called

567
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,490
the Android keychain which is the secure

568
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,769
storage area it's like the keychain on

569
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,019
Apple which have you for some ungodly

570
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,279
reason your mind is so messed up that

571
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:05,049
you think you have to store a secret

572
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,779
like this there is a place to put it

573
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:10,360
then if that's not good enough you could

574
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:12,129
encrypt it with a public key and store

575
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,309
that and have the private key on your

576
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:16,990
server then when you send the encrypted

577
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:19,389
stuff up to the server nobody can

578
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,820
decrypt it but you and it's okay if it's

579
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:22,959
leaking around this is also not rocket

580
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,559
science we've been doing this for

581
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,590
decades but what they all do is number

582
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,000
four they well most common choice is

583
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,918
number four the next most common is

584
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,870
number five neither store unencrypted on

585
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,120
the phone just right there or they

586
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,309
encrypt it with a private key and then

587
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,439
they try to hide the private key on your

588
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:42,850
phone this is like putting the key to

589
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,309
your front door under the mat it is a

590
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:48,428
very bizarre security decision just like

591
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:50,590
that Cisco technique why would you use

592
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:53,350
reversible encryption to hide a secret

593
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,809
and then try to hide the secret key on

594
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,519
the same insecure device what is wrong

595
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:01,059
with your brain I really don't know

596
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,740
anyway so um so that's what this app

597
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:04,120
does so here's the encrypted password

598
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,380
and so you can detect

599
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,479
race flows at their encryption here's

600
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,190
something I learned from the Burt book

601
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,840
web application hacker's handbook if you

602
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,970
want to find electronic codebook

603
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,010
encryption which is called so-called

604
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,840
textbook encryption all you have to do

605
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,030
is make a password that's 32 characters

606
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,560
long with all the same characters this

607
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,360
is 32 A's followed by a few more

608
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,090
characters to pass their complexity rule

609
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,850
and what happens is it broken up into 16

610
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,439
character blocks and the blocks are all

611
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:35,949
encrypted with the key and there's no

612
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:38,200
nonce so if you look and that's the last

613
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,990
few characters and the first two blocks

614
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,820
are identical because it does not

615
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,520
scramble things in a good way it uses

616
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,470
ECB mode so you can now if you want to

617
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,060
find the secret password you can read

618
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,160
the small e code here's the small e code

619
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,960
from the app and you can see very easy

620
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,270
to read it hasn't very descriptive

621
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,980
variable names so here's the encrypted

622
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:00,520
password here's how it creates that

623
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,230
encrypted password it takes the brand of

624
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,060
the phone the device number the model

625
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,580
number the serial number and the name of

626
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,770
this package which is staple zap and it

627
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,199
combines them together with this extra

628
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:14,230
salt thing at the start 3 X 2 your soul

629
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,910
takes all that then takes a sha-1 and it

630
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,770
takes the first hundred 28 bits of that

631
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,900
and that's the AES secret key so that's

632
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,360
how they hid the key under the match and

633
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,890
yet when the the app contains the source

634
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,300
code everybody can read the source code

635
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,980
so how do you think you can hide

636
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,450
anything when I can read your source

637
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,910
code especially when you give it a name

638
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,710
like encrypted password so it's not even

639
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,380
that hard to find anyway that's so

640
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,880
that's the code and I tested it I went

641
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,010
back and Riaan crypted my password and

642
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,750
created that block of data so and then I

643
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:43,450
wrote an app that would reverse this in

644
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,830
Python and then I told staples and they

645
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,900
didn't say anything they didn't care and

646
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:48,310
so I as I've been doing for years my

647
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,080
general rule is I tell people when they

648
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,790
ignore me for 30 days which they always

649
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,740
do then they become homework

650
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,149
I said well fine you have volunteers

651
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,530
time I taught Android security I used

652
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,120
this fake app somebody wrote that made

653
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,680
all these mistakes but ever since then

654
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,270
we just use real apps and usually the

655
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,490
latest version of relapse because people

656
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:05,290
are so considerate as to write crap and

657
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,120
then not fix it when I warned them so I

658
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,680
say fine now you're happy with it that

659
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,750
way then you'll be happy for my students

660
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,740
hacking into it for practice so I

661
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,910
notified them they said it would be

662
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,950
fixed they ignored me

663
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:20,910
so in April 13 they became homework

664
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,170
and so I put videos on the internet of

665
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:25,090
getting the key from the storage of the

666
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,860
equals app and then stealing my credit

667
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,240
card number from my staples account and

668
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,889
I put up the YouTube videos they didn't

669
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,630
say anything so they gave my students

670
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,720
homework stealing my credit card from my

671
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,910
staples app and they still didn't do

672
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,680
anything was then I went to the is C

673
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,240
squared conference in Washington DC and

674
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,430
tried to demonstrate this live on stage

675
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,160
and bothered them enough that they

676
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:48,070
actually fixed it what they did was they

677
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,140
put in rooted device detection so it'll

678
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,820
detect if you're running on a rooted

679
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,110
device which is what you're going to

680
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,149
want to do to steal the data off the

681
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,889
phone so I said now I would have to get

682
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,930
a real Android phone and put using my

683
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,070
emulator which I haven't bothered doing

684
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,800
yet to prove that they didn't really

685
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:04,840
secure it but they made it so my exact

686
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,129
attack will not work following the exact

687
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,320
steps in my homework anymore

688
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,270
and this is a common response which

689
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,220
someone had a nice diagram up here we

690
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:15,520
have pets the vulnerability you reported

691
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,710
on in some sense you could say they have

692
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,270
and I strongly suspect they did not

693
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,460
actually quit story in the password on

694
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,960
the phone but I didn't they did make it

695
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,400
so it was slightly inconvenient for me

696
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,740
to test that and I haven't bothered to

697
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,500
go test it again yet but anyway some so

698
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,880
I said a lot of people do this now some

699
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,380
of these guys like McDonald's in each

700
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,530
hardware just saw your password in plain

701
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,090
text which is pretty outrageous um some

702
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,590
people just have plain text login where

703
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:41,350
you just send plain text passwords over

704
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,510
the web and everywhere pick them right

705
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,219
up here and then there's a lot of people

706
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,790
have broken SSL this guy thought was

707
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,560
pretty fun

708
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,360
he made this thing called price tracker

709
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,040
for Amazon you can install it and it

710
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,449
will watch the Amazon price which as

711
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,520
you've probably heard fluctuates a lot

712
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,020
and find out when the price hits a low

713
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,210
value and then you can buy your product

714
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,040
and it does this by taking your Amazon

715
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,630
username and password and using it to

716
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,280
log in Amazon now see I was at a faculty

717
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,810
meeting we have a lot of these faculty

718
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,670
meetings where they have long boring

719
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,560
presentations of complete garbage that I

720
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:10,300
don't want to hear and so what I do is I

721
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,070
hack into things everything back testing

722
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,960
apps I said holy cow I hacked into

723
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,490
Amazon this is the greatest meeting ever

724
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,660
they said well I have no idea what they

725
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,370
were saying up there but this is great

726
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,540
and I thought I hacked into Amazon is

727
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,610
that doesn't seem right

728
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:24,010
Amazon couldn't be this stupid these

729
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,719
guys have nothing to do with Amazon some

730
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,310
third party guy decided to make

731
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,530
something that will watch your Amazon

732
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:31,399
account and he did it by taking your

733
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:33,158
Amazon name and password using it

734
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:35,928
your Amazon account Amazon has no

735
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:38,299
participation in any of this I sort of

736
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:40,070
thought they would care but um so I

737
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:42,859
contacted him I said dude you're at

738
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,629
breaks HTTP you can put in the middle

739
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:46,129
attack and he said yeah I just put that

740
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:49,189
in the last version do you like it I'm

741
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:51,259
like dude he said yeah you know what

742
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,789
happened before I put that in people

743
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:54,169
could get these irritating error

744
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:55,940
messages on the screen and they were

745
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:57,379
complaining and I said I know how to get

746
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,059
rid of those I'll turn off the

747
00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:00,619
encryption there now it doesn't pop

748
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:03,559
those stupid error messages anymore it's

749
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:05,269
great isn't it listen but but but dude

750
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,710
you can't just turn off the certificate

751
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:08,239
validation and leave it that way and not

752
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,219
tell anybody you said why it's working

753
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:12,559
fine people are happy I see dude but

754
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:13,729
look I put an advanced page you can go

755
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,289
in the advanced settings and turn it

756
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:18,019
back on but why would you want to do

757
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:19,759
that I'm like dude anyway so this is a

758
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:22,009
from his point of view this is a

759
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,450
desirable feature and I said I tried to

760
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:24,799
convince him read back and forth like

761
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,269
six or eight times I said you really

762
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,460
can't just turn off the fundamental

763
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:30,289
security feature of the phone and not

764
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,869
tell anybody and feel like that is great

765
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:34,009
and he said well all right I'll fix it

766
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:37,249
but I don't think he ever fixed it

767
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:38,869
anyway so I'm then as people use this

768
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:40,759
reversible encryption which you know

769
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:42,289
Microsoft figured out around Windows 95

770
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,599
that they should stop storing passwords

771
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:46,609
with reversible encryption and they

772
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:48,200
deprecated it and turned it off and

773
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:49,939
Android developers have not yet even

774
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,499
noticed it's a bad idea so anyway the

775
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,450
safe way well greens Kroger or Home

776
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:55,009
Depot they're all doing the same stupid

777
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:57,769
thing here's the home depot password

778
00:27:55,009 --> 00:28:01,369
stored locally and all you have to do is

779
00:27:57,769 --> 00:28:02,749
unpack the apk you'll find the code that

780
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:04,218
encrypts the password and they're all

781
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:08,109
pretty much doing the same stupid thing

782
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:12,440
they're using password key derivation PD

783
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:14,029
pbkdf2 and then combining junk to make

784
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,009
the password like just a fixed string

785
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:19,009
this one uses the string this is a very

786
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:24,289
insecure key they do something equally

787
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:26,599
stupid and so you can get the key and I

788
00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:28,460
broke various Python programs to recover

789
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:30,080
the password for all these apps and then

790
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,909
set all these guys notifications and

791
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,710
they don't care but anyway it's good

792
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:35,089
practice for my students this is all the

793
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,349
Python it takes to make something it

794
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:39,200
will take the data off the phone and

795
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:41,149
receive the plaintext password so I

796
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,759
tried it in various cases anyway the

797
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:44,908
kroger is the same and Safeway is the

798
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,700
same law degree

799
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:48,359
is the same everybody so what's going on

800
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,919
here

801
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,029
I noticed that doing all these apps

802
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,169
there's really only like three different

803
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,970
kinds of apps I think they're really

804
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:56,609
only three people writing Android apps

805
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,049
and they have like five fake names and

806
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,639
they all pretend to go through a company

807
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:00,809
in Texas that just outsources it to

808
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:01,738
Pakistan or wherever they are and

809
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:03,239
they're all just reusing the same

810
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:04,919
libraries over and over and over and

811
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:07,889
over there somebody thinks it's okay to

812
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:10,139
do this and apparently nobody in America

813
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:11,699
ever audits their stuff which is what

814
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:13,469
amazed me you know I thought there would

815
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,179
be managers auditing your stuff to see

816
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,700
if you did it right and obviously there

817
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:20,970
is not they just looked to see if it

818
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,499
appears to work and that's it um by the

819
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,229
way a few people actually did fix things

820
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:26,849
like Golf Galaxy and JP Morgan they had

821
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:28,440
password exposed in the log and they

822
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,809
fixed it and they had broken SSL and

823
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,190
they actually fixed it so what's funny

824
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:33,479
is that I couldn't get through they had

825
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,279
all these contact forms and I couldn't

826
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:36,749
get through so I finally found the CEO

827
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,419
on Twitter which I've done three or four

828
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:40,710
times the CEOs of major companies are on

829
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,929
Twitter and when you tweet them they

830
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,179
will answer you which surprised me and

831
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:46,859
so I said let me send you a personal

832
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:48,330
private messages they dude your app has

833
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:50,399
a serious security problem and no one

834
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,199
seems to care and when I go to the forum

835
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,459
and try to turn it in I just get errors

836
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,710
and I can't turn anything for him so he

837
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,330
said so like the guy called me and he

838
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,549
said in the first place and don't do

839
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,749
that again in the second place here's my

840
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:02,309
phone number call me if you find a

841
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:03,599
problem so I found another problem and

842
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:08,460
called him didn't get an answer but

843
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:09,928
anyway um it's but you know this is to

844
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,669
be fair I've been more on the business

845
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:13,259
side of this you know when companies

846
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:14,999
start they think look we're gonna sell

847
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:16,649
products like cookies I sell your cookie

848
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:18,779
I take the money that's it we're done

849
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,279
and it's really painful to realize that

850
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:22,049
when you sell someone a tap it's like

851
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,849
adopting them as your child they're

852
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:25,139
gonna come back I need more money you

853
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:26,789
don't want to borrow the car I need an

854
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:28,109
update I need a patch there's a security

855
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:29,609
problem you have to keep on spending

856
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:31,379
more and more money taking care of them

857
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:32,849
forever even though they don't keep

858
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:34,259
paying you more and more money this is

859
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:35,129
why you know Microsoft finally got fed

860
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:37,320
up with this and they said we're not

861
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:39,149
gonna sell you windows 95 in a box and

862
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,859
call the transaction done we're gonna

863
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:43,018
make you pay every month for

864
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:44,759
subscription to office 365 because that

865
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:46,229
much more correctly describes our

866
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,989
relationship with you you're gonna be

867
00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:51,210
back every week bleeding there's a bug

868
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:52,799
there's a security flaw I need a new

869
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,179
driver and we're just gonna have to keep

870
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,769
spending money on you forever so you

871
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:58,440
better be paying us money forever that

872
00:30:55,769 --> 00:31:00,810
probably is much better anyway

873
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,910
so the companies all want to hope that

874
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:04,050
this isn't going to happen so then there

875
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,030
are people that really have to store

876
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:08,040
your password the web services where you

877
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,120
really log in they have to know when

878
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,740
you're putting the right password and

879
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,330
have to store it somewhere so we can see

880
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,880
what they're doing and what they're

881
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:16,860
doing is of course no better so team

882
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,240
ghost shell is one of the hacking clubs

883
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,830
that went in stole a whole ton of data

884
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,530
and dumped it on pastebin so I could

885
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:24,540
examine it and they have some complete

886
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,980
in coherent political drivel about how

887
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,440
some other saving the world by doing

888
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,000
this which you know is all garbage but

889
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,260
it is handy for reasons I want to see

890
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,720
how people are storing stuff on the web

891
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,400
so they hacked into the CIA but it's not

892
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,300
the CIA you think it is it's like a

893
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,920
housing development in Florida but um

894
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,419
anyway they hacked into varley's groups

895
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,150
and so here's the types of passwords

896
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,710
storage well here I thought plaintext is

897
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,920
the worst thing you can do but I was

898
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:52,230
wrong you could do this this company is

899
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,690
called BB exchange Buchanan bond

900
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,850
exchange and the passwords are Buchanan

901
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,530
bond one we can't have bond one and bond

902
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,080
one so they're just the name of the

903
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,520
company plus one so that's pretty good

904
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,949
fun and here's another one

905
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,960
Reeves and associates the passwords are

906
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,810
mostly one two three four or one two

907
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,820
three four five or oh s law three-to-one

908
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:13,350
you know they just all have some default

909
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,700
value the name of the company plus three

910
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:16,980
two one or something and they're all the

911
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,330
same and stored in plain text on the web

912
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,060
beta database with sequel injection

913
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:23,159
vulnerability and then there's sparklin

914
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:27,149
this company called sparklin and the

915
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:29,460
passwords are all sparklin yeah the

916
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,750
column next to the right admin password

917
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:34,020
is the administrator all the rest your

918
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:36,660
sparklin so this one's called sales info

919
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,940
the highly secure one so adding the then

920
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,440
be forward had these transactions with

921
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,000
and they had all the personally

922
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,620
identifiable information in them because

923
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,900
at this time I think this has changed

924
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,280
now but at this time passwords were not

925
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,650
considered personally identifiable

926
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,149
information so if you leak a password

927
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,690
you didn't have to notify the customers

928
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:56,550
but but any man address was PII so this

929
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,690
company be forward was in trouble when

930
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,450
sequel injection dumped out the

931
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:02,370
customers names and addresses and here's

932
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,170
their passwords to which are here at

933
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,899
least they're not all the same but they

934
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,810
are on plain text and easy to see be you

935
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,380
see 82 and so on

936
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:14,039
and

937
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,909
than my phone anyway um yeah I forgot to

938
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,259
beat my phone private I'm very

939
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:21,690
incompetent at operating phones let me

940
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:23,070
see if I can make it shut up nope okay

941
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,320
when it's ringing there's no way to make

942
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,549
it shut up anymore anyway so then the

943
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,370
next thing you could do is you could use

944
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:31,590
base64 here's be forward a Japanese auto

945
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,479
parts website and the password you're

946
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:37,408
over there on the right there base64

947
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:40,470
strings MGR JD and down here they in

948
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:42,779
their terms of servers reasonable

949
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:44,129
security measures to protect meant

950
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:47,039
unauthorized access

951
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:48,559
so progressively reasonable is basics t4

952
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,559
which of course you can just reverse

953
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:55,049
trivially like those Cisco passwords but

954
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,759
that's that's what they do and why

955
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:57,990
anybody would bother with this it's not

956
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:59,700
as well let's put them in plain text as

957
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,129
do something that's stupid now pay md5

958
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,070
and sha-1 is also a common fictitious

959
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:06,719
belief that this is protecting passwords

960
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:08,849
when it is fundamentally flawed because

961
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,490
the whole point of md5 and sha-1 they

962
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:12,990
were designed to be fast so that if you

963
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:14,879
download a movie and there's 600

964
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:16,408
megabytes you can check the hash and you

965
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,168
don't have to spend an hour calculating

966
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:23,849
it and fast is what you do not want for

967
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:26,190
password hashes so here's MD MIT MIT one

968
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:28,230
of their minor servers had these open

969
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,599
sequel injection and all these password

970
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,949
hashes and the company the person that

971
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,079
downloaded them was able to crack

972
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:35,009
hiawatha you see it in the middle there

973
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,569
and the other ones they weren't able to

974
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,550
crack but I was able to crack am I just

975
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:40,889
using a descriptor site I didn't do

976
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:43,470
anything sophisticated here and so

977
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:45,270
here's this guy's password it's Borg 7 R

978
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:47,129
5 a it probably thinks that's a pretty

979
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:49,230
secure password but when you start with

980
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:51,029
one round of md5 it's not very secure at

981
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:53,219
all because you can very easily try

982
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,230
millions and millions of guesses anyway

983
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:56,790
they do have nice incident response form

984
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,170
so you can tell an idea about this I

985
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:59,339
don't know if they care or do anything

986
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,480
about it but at least they have a way to

987
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:03,569
report it which is better than most

988
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,880
people and then my sequel 3 to 3 has the

989
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:07,470
ability to store passwords in a hashed

990
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,730
form and there are various forms here

991
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,618
and some of them are actually reasonably

992
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:14,130
strong but not these and you can crack

993
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:16,470
them with cain and here's a sha-1 hash

994
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,690
that somebody used one round of sha-1

995
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,040
and that's also easy to crack in there

996
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,590
these

997
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,600
been to four six nine oh seven four oh

998
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:24,980
that's like a 10 character password your

999
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,620
letters and numbers he probably thinks

1000
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,120
it's secure but I could just put it in

1001
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,609
an online form and crack it in a few

1002
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:36,640
seconds because sha-1 is not strong

1003
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:39,350
enough and there's my sequel five and

1004
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,720
WordPress passwords which can be pretty

1005
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:43,460
good but a lot of these were cracked

1006
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,040
these first one was chicken to marine

1007
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,480
chicken - and the last one again I was

1008
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,029
able to crack by just finding a better

1009
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,890
online site it's evan ash which looks

1010
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,990
like somebody's name or a word backwards

1011
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,819
or something but you know even those

1012
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:58,509
relatively strong hashes is not strong

1013
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:03,650
enough so then we get down to the CIA

1014
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:05,510
and so the CIA here has got real

1015
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:10,130
customer names and addresses leaking out

1016
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:11,540
and phone numbers and so anyway if you

1017
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,160
want to store these hashes there's the

1018
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,630
right way to do it is there really a

1019
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,230
couple a couple of algorithms out there

1020
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:20,090
which are good enough for simple use

1021
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:21,410
although there was a password hashing

1022
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:23,480
contest and a bunch of European

1023
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,620
cryptographers I saw it passwords Conn

1024
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,630
the last couple of years that talked

1025
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:29,210
about their the advanced cryptographic

1026
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:31,310
features you might want but bcrypt

1027
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:33,950
and s crypt are good enough for most

1028
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:36,200
purposes beak and all be crypt is you

1029
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:38,180
can't use md5 sha-1 shot or anything

1030
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,830
like that because it's fast and that

1031
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,210
means I can take a database of a hundred

1032
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,680
million passwords and try them all

1033
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:44,750
without waiting too long and that's just

1034
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,520
what you don't want what you want is for

1035
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:49,370
it to take something like 10 or 20

1036
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:52,880
milliseconds to calculate one hash then

1037
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:55,009
when you person logs in they send you a

1038
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,270
password you hash it it takes you 20

1039
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,250
milliseconds and you see if it's right

1040
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,720
20 milliseconds is not too long because

1041
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,640
humans are typing and they won't notice

1042
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,379
that time delay which is fine so it

1043
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,819
doesn't hurt you any but it really hurts

1044
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,400
the attacker because now they can only

1045
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,930
try 10 or 50 guesses per second so they

1046
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,610
can never get through a list of 100

1047
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,080
million passwords and try them all now

1048
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,550
it's good enough to just have your dog's

1049
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,259
name followed by the area where born

1050
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,210
because it's not going to be the top

1051
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,480
1,000 passwords and they don't have time

1052
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:22,100
to try the others so bcrypt is just many

1053
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,530
rounds of these other hash functions

1054
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,810
like 5,000 rounds of sha-512 is what

1055
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,760
unix send the mac use Microsoft

1056
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:31,520
continues to use one round of md4

1057
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,490
because they are very strange and they

1058
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,130
their password

1059
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:37,680
caching system is so old they designed

1060
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,440
this before md5 had been written which

1061
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,600
is why they used MD 4 and they never

1062
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,550
updated it since 1993 in Windows NT

1063
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,080
version one for some unknown reason

1064
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,660
while the rest of the world has gone up

1065
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,700
to five thousand rounds of sha-512 so

1066
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,200
Microsoft asteroid hashes are literally

1067
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,089
1 million times weaker than Linux

1068
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,819
password hashes and Mac's password

1069
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:58,950
hashes anyway then we can talk about

1070
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:03,270
other basic logic errors like locking

1071
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:05,069
your bike in this fashion and one

1072
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:07,500
example here is San Fransisco parking

1073
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:09,330
meters in Sam blackhat drill grad went

1074
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,980
to the San Francisco parking meters Joe

1075
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,420
grand and other people noise bridges

1076
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,369
they decided to check out these new

1077
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,500
electronic parking meters where you can

1078
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:18,390
put in your car detects it and here's

1079
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,400
how the parking meter works the meter

1080
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:22,319
has some counter it sends it up to the

1081
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,270
card then the meter uses that to

1082
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,860
generate a password then it sends the

1083
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,369
password up to the card to see if it's

1084
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,470
okay

1085
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:30,510
then anybody it's okay it decides you

1086
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:33,060
have enough money now some of you may

1087
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:35,550
have noticed a logic problem here who

1088
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,549
decided if the password was okay it was

1089
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:40,830
the card that's a rather strange thing

1090
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,810
to do isn't it so all you have to do is

1091
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:44,910
make a card that always tells the meter

1092
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,960
the password is okay and now you have

1093
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:47,460
all the money you want

1094
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,690
that's it will always be that full of

1095
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,340
money you can make a card that sits it

1096
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:52,170
there's a maximum value of $1000 it

1097
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,540
never goes down and always tells the

1098
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:57,780
meter oh yes everything's fine oh yes I

1099
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:00,000
have enough money oh yes it's you know

1100
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:04,260
why would you ask the card if the

1101
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,500
password is okay very twisted anyway

1102
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,970
that was in 2009 and then there's

1103
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,830
encrypted storage now we've all heard

1104
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,299
this right everybody he's losing laptops

1105
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,980
they have whole palettes of them at San

1106
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,780
Francisco Airport they did thousands of

1107
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,280
drops and they just auctioned them off

1108
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,830
every year all the laptops people left

1109
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,450
on airplanes and all those are just full

1110
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,509
of company data and this is really bad

1111
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:26,279
this would be breaches so they put

1112
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,540
encryption on them and before that there

1113
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,250
were these little thumb drives everybody

1114
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,350
used to carry and I saw a survey about

1115
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,600
eight years ago of top executives they

1116
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,839
said the average executive owns 20 USB

1117
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,310
sticks and has lost 15 of them and I was

1118
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,630
certainly not category two and all those

1119
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,890
things are full of company data of

1120
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,780
course why else do you have them and

1121
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,830
this is not good so there became an

1122
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,270
interest in making sure these things

1123
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:48,670
were encrypted and here's the

1124
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:51,820
imple 70 laptops waiting in the New

1125
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:54,550
Jersey Airport in one month at the TSA

1126
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,710
luggage area and so on so they decided

1127
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,680
to make secure flex drives and this is

1128
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:01,510
from 2009 so in 2009 the secure

1129
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,770
encrypted flash drives were not really

1130
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:07,150
all that secure and encrypted

1131
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:09,370
um what they did was they did not do the

1132
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:11,620
password verification on the thumb drive

1133
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:17,170
they did a password verification on the

1134
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:19,810
PC and the password on the drive was

1135
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,550
almost the same the encryption key was

1136
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,259
always the same the the password was

1137
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,570
just tell you to use the encryption key

1138
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:29,800
that was on the drive so all you have to

1139
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:32,410
do is hack the app on the computer to

1140
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,090
accept any password and tell the thing

1141
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,500
okay they gave me the right password go

1142
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,270
ahead and decrypt it it's basically the

1143
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,340
same thing as that parking meter the

1144
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:41,710
untrusted device is the one deciding

1145
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,140
whether it's okay to tell the trusted

1146
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,270
device that you've been authorized so by

1147
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,799
making a modified app to put on the PC

1148
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,630
they can open any drive so that was the

1149
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,860
whole threat model shot I mean the

1150
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,630
threat model was someone who's gonna

1151
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,400
steal your laptop and have the drive and

1152
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,740
you want to be able to tell your

1153
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,870
regulatory bodies that we didn't have a

1154
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,919
data breach because the bad guy will not

1155
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,259
be able to read the data on that drive

1156
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,750
but all the bad guy needs to do is use

1157
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,490
hack software and it will be able to

1158
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,530
read that because your password is not

1159
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,540
used to encrypt the drive their password

1160
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,710
is just used in software to tell the

1161
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:15,210
drive that you have permission to open

1162
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:18,280
the drive and that's not the same thing

1163
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:20,050
Western Digital is more of the same same

1164
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,350
story here Western Digital passwords in

1165
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:25,180
2015 they had the same problem they all

1166
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,620
these drives tried to meet some official

1167
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,330
standard that was far too complicated

1168
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,770
and won't have many different people

1169
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:31,270
with different passwords that would have

1170
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,490
access to different areas that are drive

1171
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:35,380
and they found it far too difficult to

1172
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,209
actually do that so what they did was

1173
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,560
encrypt all the data on the whole drive

1174
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,820
with the same password store the

1175
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,590
password on the drive and put all that

1176
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:43,510
in the app again though the app decide

1177
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:45,070
what part you're allowed to see which of

1178
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,560
course is not good enough and so they

1179
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:49,810
were totally able to just make a

1180
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,180
modified app that would read all the

1181
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,740
encrypted data on the drive and then of

1182
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,629
course you probably saw last week

1183
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,669
BitLocker is also shot and I'm a maid

1184
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,800
I'm waiting for the lawsuits every

1185
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,130
company in the world has been trusting

1186
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,260
bet

1187
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:04,450
for five years and they've been losing

1188
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,520
50,000 laptops a year on the airplanes

1189
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:08,770
and telling all everybody we didn't lose

1190
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,720
that data because a bit Locker is secure

1191
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,970
and it turns out that BitLocker is

1192
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,730
horrible because BitLocker does not

1193
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:17,500
perform any encryption if it detects

1194
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,960
that you haven't encrypted SSD that it

1195
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,520
says oh the SSD hardware is taking care

1196
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,770
of encryption so I don't have to do it

1197
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,420
and it doesn't tell you that and it

1198
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,009
turns out that the SSD encryption is

1199
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,800
still the same way as all the other ones

1200
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,870
the SSD encryption is worthless it's

1201
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,280
using a key that's on the SSD to encrypt

1202
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,770
it and just make it seem like after a

1203
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,650
password to get at it when you don't so

1204
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:41,110
all those lost laptops can totally be

1205
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:44,140
opened except for the ones that have

1206
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:45,700
magnetic hard drives or the very few

1207
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,259
where someone actually understood this

1208
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,960
and went into the registry or group

1209
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,760
policy or something and told Microsoft

1210
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,710
BitLocker to put another layer of

1211
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,390
encrypted on it on the encryption on an

1212
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,800
encrypted device which is what Microsoft

1213
00:42:55,390 --> 00:43:01,029
said a couple days ago you should do

1214
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,890
they say now you can make BitLocker do

1215
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:04,480
another layer of encryption on top of

1216
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,420
whatever's there and then it would be

1217
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,890
okay and it would be but the problem is

1218
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,450
there's all those laptops already out

1219
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,160
there being lost in the hands of thieves

1220
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:15,100
that people thought were safe so I can

1221
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,279
see huge lawsuits flying around anyway

1222
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:20,290
so you know this is my big message learn

1223
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,870
some math I mean this is not that hard

1224
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:23,890
if you if you were in third grade and

1225
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,170
your teacher convinced you you were

1226
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:28,000
stupid you can't understand math try it

1227
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,680
again it's not that hard I had a student

1228
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,810
who would vote warpath math is horrible

1229
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,919
anybody does math is a terrible person

1230
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,450
you should just get rid of them all it

1231
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,580
makes me feel bad and I said you know

1232
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:38,529
try it again he went took Alex races hey

1233
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,880
this isn't that hard it's not that hard

1234
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:42,220
if you can count on your fingers you can

1235
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,870
do math it's just you were taught in a

1236
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:46,089
really cruel way in American education

1237
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:48,819
that made you feel stupid because they

1238
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,350
did it wrong if you'd go back as an

1239
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,970
adult it's not any harder than anything

1240
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:53,200
else you've learned so learn how to do

1241
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:54,609
this besides you don't need to be a

1242
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,710
genius and invent a new cryptographic

1243
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:59,500
algorithm for God's sake don't do that

1244
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:01,540
just use the standard stuff that's there

1245
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,670
and learn how to use it correctly all

1246
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:05,140
you need to understand is hashing public

1247
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:07,870
key encryption and private key

1248
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,759
encryption and if you have something

1249
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:11,770
called private key encryption that means

1250
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,390
you've got a key and you have to somehow

1251
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:15,820
hide that key that's a

1252
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:17,500
problem so if you are handing someone a

1253
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,360
storage device that's gonna get stolen

1254
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,950
you don't have anywhere to hide the key

1255
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,020
so you shouldn't be using private key

1256
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,149
encryption that's all it is it's not

1257
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,880
rocket science you got to use public key

1258
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:30,340
encryption in that case and so you know

1259
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:32,590
this is my there should be management

1260
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,240
that is examining your work and

1261
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,370
management should be asking these

1262
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,410
questions do you really need to store

1263
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:40,410
this data you're storing like why are

1264
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:44,020
you storing the password in your apps

1265
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:45,640
data directory on a phone what makes you

1266
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:46,900
think you have to do that you don't do

1267
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,629
that in the browser why do you think you

1268
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,950
have to do that on the phone I baffled

1269
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,330
this the way they do that then if you

1270
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,399
are storing something secret is it

1271
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:55,930
encrypted how did you encrypt it and

1272
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,430
where did you put the key this is very

1273
00:44:55,930 --> 00:45:00,460
simple like you know the step one of

1274
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:03,160
most security is what is it you value

1275
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,720
and where is it most businesses have a

1276
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,430
huge problem with this they say well we

1277
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,899
have this stuff we value like customers

1278
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:10,390
credit card numbers and our proprietary

1279
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,820
PDF files they say where is it they say

1280
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:14,890
well it's on our server and it's on my

1281
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,090
thumb drive and it's in my Dropbox and

1282
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,950
it's on my home machine and it's on

1283
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,780
everybody's phone and it's on everybody

1284
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,700
they sent copies to and all our vendors

1285
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,780
and she I don't know how many copies of

1286
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,790
it there are everywhere and they said

1287
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:27,310
well that's step one how about you

1288
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:29,110
numerating where your goodies are and

1289
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,970
then we can start talking about making

1290
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:33,670
sure that they're protected and it's the

1291
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:35,290
same thing here you management does not

1292
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:38,290
have to be technical they should ask

1293
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:40,900
these very simple questions where is the

1294
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:42,910
goodies what protection is there where

1295
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,130
did you put that key it's amazing that

1296
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,379
they aren't and so you know that's why I

1297
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:52,390
feel like I wanted to tell you about

1298
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,930
this yeah you should okay in the first

1299
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,819
place

1300
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,049
if or if you're gonna put the key

1301
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,450
somewhere you have to put it somewhere

1302
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,640
safe and this is a huge problem um the

1303
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,740
only the only case I can think of where

1304
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,270
private key encryption is actually any

1305
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,939
use is for something like encrypting

1306
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:09,220
your backups where you have the key

1307
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:11,110
never leaves it's not any good for

1308
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,580
sending messages because if you want to

1309
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,960
send a message to someone with private

1310
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,870
key encryption you have to somehow send

1311
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,250
them the key and therefore if you have

1312
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:19,779
some safe way to tend the key you could

1313
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:21,010
just send a message that way so private

1314
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,540
key encryption is fundamentally

1315
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:25,930
logically useless for almost any

1316
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,560
application it's all we had until 1979

1317
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:29,259
we invented

1318
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,779
the key encryption until then all

1319
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,760
encryption required on this oxymoron

1320
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,530
called a shared secret right I have to

1321
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,870
tell you a secret and we too know it and

1322
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:39,700
nobody else knows and therefore we're

1323
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:41,589
screwed because I don't really know that

1324
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,060
nobody's stolen in transit and I

1325
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,920
certainly don't know that you're not

1326
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,080
losing or making extra copies there's no

1327
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,940
way I can detect that so I have a shared

1328
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,049
secret which is a fundamental weakness

1329
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,780
now a lot of people have done things

1330
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:55,360
that way but public key encryption is

1331
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:58,030
the alternative I can have a private key

1332
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:00,040
and a public key pair and now I can

1333
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:01,300
receive secrets I can tell everybody the

1334
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,650
public key they could all send me

1335
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:14,550
secrets nobody can read them with me

1336
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:14,550
that works yeah yeah

1337
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:31,450
yes yeah

1338
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:56,149
yeah you've got a point that certainly

1339
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,440
would work for the recording let me just

1340
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:00,109
say what he's saying you could use a

1341
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,240
password and then run it through bcrypt

1342
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:04,400
to make a key and then that would be as

1343
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,589
secure as the password so you could have

1344
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,029
a secret that is stored in a hash form

1345
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:09,470
on the phone that's hard to recover and

1346
00:48:08,029 --> 00:48:10,700
that would probably be what they should

1347
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,109
have done for those encrypted hard

1348
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,399
drives or several different people are

1349
00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:16,038
going to encrypt portions the hard drive

1350
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,119
but for things like Android apps they

1351
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:18,349
should never have done any of this

1352
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,809
because there is no reason to store the

1353
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:22,430
password on the phone at all but anyway

1354
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:23,930
you're right that that can be done and

1355
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:26,450
that is an alternative that's one way to

1356
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:29,538
handle a secret but most people that end

1357
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:31,700
up thinking along those lines have

1358
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,900
already gone down the wrong path because

1359
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,629
they could have just not stored the

1360
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,700
secret on there at all and but anyway

1361
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,650
it's that's a good point and there by

1362
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,390
the way I wanted to mention there are

1363
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,130
some other advanced issues to think

1364
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:45,440
about here like one that has gotten the

1365
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:47,299
cryptocurrency community is the world's

1366
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,940
greatest show I mean they're just a

1367
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:51,710
bunch of crooks so it's it's incredibly

1368
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,019
clear people what they do is they have

1369
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:55,759
this baffling complexity is exactly what

1370
00:48:54,019 --> 00:48:59,149
they did with mortgage-backed securities

1371
00:48:55,759 --> 00:49:00,859
in 2008 they say you're gonna finance

1372
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,630
somebody's mortgage well then a person

1373
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:04,098
would say do they have a job can they

1374
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:05,569
pay it back so we don't want you asking

1375
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:07,009
that question because the answer is

1376
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:10,009
something you won't like so we'll make

1377
00:49:07,009 --> 00:49:13,069
this mind-boggling baffling aggregate

1378
00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:14,869
security for you to invest in that mixes

1379
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:16,190
it all up with layers of complication to

1380
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:17,720
keep you from realizing I'm picking your

1381
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:20,119
pockets and that's what cryptocurrency

1382
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,709
community is endless complexity to

1383
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:26,450
dazzle you while I pick your pocket at

1384
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:27,859
the other hand and the UM but anyway one

1385
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:29,480
thing they've done lately is bunch of

1386
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:31,098
them are claiming to be quantum proof so

1387
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,900
I should mention quantum computers are

1388
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:34,880
coming quantum supremacy should happen

1389
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,470
about next year Google thinks they have

1390
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,380
achieved quantum supremacy and they are

1391
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:41,419
partnering with NASA to prove it and

1392
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,190
nobody knows if that's true or not but

1393
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,049
if it isn't true this year it'll be true

1394
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:47,089
pretty soon that real working quantum

1395
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:48,680
computers are here and when they are our

1396
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:51,619
current forms of public key encryption

1397
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,598
will be shot RSA is doomed

1398
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:55,489
even keys a million bits long will not

1399
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,420
be secured saving them ten or fifteen

1400
00:49:55,489 --> 00:49:58,310
years

1401
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:01,310
we all expect the current public key

1402
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:03,590
systems to fade away and become useless

1403
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:05,330
but replacements are already out there

1404
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,800
there are 72 candidates still surviving

1405
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:08,150
in the current contest and so there will

1406
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,460
be another generation of public key

1407
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:12,140
encryption the main winner is expected

1408
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,220
to be lattice encryption in the form of

1409
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:15,379
Google's new hope

1410
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,669
but it's any amount just about the same

1411
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,440
there's a private key and a public key

1412
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:19,880
and it works the same or less be

1413
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:27,020
different algorithms running on the end

1414
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:28,430
yeah Oh blob change is a very good

1415
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,650
question about block chains i crypto

1416
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,359
currencies and I SEOs I don't approve of

1417
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:35,750
it all I think they're all just pyramid

1418
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:37,460
schemes and scams because I used to work

1419
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:39,620
in pyramid schemes for the Federal Trade

1420
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,970
Commission and I believe I was the

1421
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:44,750
expert in the finances of pyramid

1422
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:46,490
schemes and that's all they are but and

1423
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,380
Bitcoin in particular is an attempt to

1424
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:50,569
disrupt the financial structure of the

1425
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:52,940
global economy and a totally failed one

1426
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:54,640
but anyway those cryptocurrencies like

1427
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:56,840
political stunts or something.but

1428
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,220
blockchains are important and worth

1429
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,470
learning because they will be used in

1430
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,910
every company very soon not public

1431
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:04,100
blockchains with everybody in the world

1432
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,930
mining but private blockchains between

1433
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,400
your company and its branch offices and

1434
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,589
business partners to do things like

1435
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,660
supply chain management in five years

1436
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,820
just like everybody has a Mongo database

1437
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,529
and a sequel database they'll have a

1438
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,600
blockchain database because there is

1439
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,880
some business use of it it's not gonna

1440
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,890
change the world but it'll be another

1441
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,990
wrinkle on a database than blog the only

1442
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:26,299
part of a blockchain is everybody can

1443
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:28,339
write to it and nobody can erase

1444
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,470
anything so you have an unalterable log

1445
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:33,290
of what everybody said and there are

1446
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:35,480
certain uses for that but making it

1447
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:38,600
public and making the whole world able

1448
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,920
to mine it is kind of nuts and that's

1449
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,450
what the public cryptocurrencies are

1450
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,350
doing and they're they're a solution in

1451
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:44,450
search of a problem

1452
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:46,339
unless you really believe that we need

1453
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:48,470
to alter the way money works on earth in

1454
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,670
which case they're far too slow that's

1455
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:51,700
like aetherium I heard someone describe

1456
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:54,830
eutherian last week as the world's

1457
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:56,629
biggest supercomputer but it's not it's

1458
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:58,990
an infant computer it's how do you make

1459
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:01,280
computing a million times slower a

1460
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:03,500
strange thing that most people wouldn't

1461
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,000
really want but every time I do an

1462
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,860
operation on my machine a million other

1463
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,600
machines have to do it too for no

1464
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,050
apparent reason but that's aetherium

1465
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,049
yeah

1466
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:22,220
yeah yeah well botching is secure in the

1467
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:23,750
sense that it is a record that is

1468
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,189
cryptographically signed that cannot be

1469
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:26,869
altered and if you wanted to do it the

1470
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:28,849
thing I tell people go to IBM's hyper

1471
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:31,220
ledger hyper ledger is the business

1472
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:33,589
blockchain it's ready to go it is

1473
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,058
already being deployed I've talked

1474
00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:36,650
crypto classes with blockchain all

1475
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:38,930
summer and last year and a lot of my

1476
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,640
students are deploying it it is not a

1477
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:42,230
public chain with everybody doing things

1478
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,819
like Bitcoin you run it on your server

1479
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,019
just like the other databases just like

1480
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:46,910
their Mongo and your sequel and

1481
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:49,008
everything and your the point of it is

1482
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:50,299
if you are a business and you have to

1483
00:52:49,009 --> 00:52:51,710
deal with other people you don't really

1484
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:53,269
trust which really is pretty much

1485
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,619
everybody but some Lockheed Martin I

1486
00:52:53,269 --> 00:52:56,808
know is doing is you're trying to build

1487
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:58,309
an airplane you need to have staff from

1488
00:52:56,809 --> 00:52:59,690
here and electrical components from

1489
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:01,609
there and aluminum from there and you

1490
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,599
have deals and all these people promise

1491
00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:04,549
things and then they don't really

1492
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:06,349
deliver on time and then they try to lie

1493
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:07,849
and say I said it in something so you

1494
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,859
just want a record here's what you

1495
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:11,720
promised here's what you shipped it

1496
00:53:09,859 --> 00:53:13,400
here's when we got it here's when we

1497
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,230
filed our complaint you therefore have

1498
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,690
to pay this fine or something and that's

1499
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,970
what a blockchain is everybody can share

1500
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:22,250
this database they can all write to it

1501
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:24,740
nobody can ever alter anything in the

1502
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:26,299
past so we have a clear record of what

1503
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:29,240
happens that nobody can argue about

1504
00:53:26,299 --> 00:53:31,130
that's what it's for but not you don't

1505
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,689
share with the whole world you share it

1506
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:33,920
with your business partners that you're

1507
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:36,259
trying to establish a trust relationship

1508
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,849
with and of course the idea is if

1509
00:53:36,259 --> 00:53:39,740
everybody knows you have a good

1510
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:41,660
blockchain running then they will know

1511
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:43,160
not to bother trying to lie to you about

1512
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,868
living up to their promises anymore

1513
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,430
because there's a record and we can all

1514
00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:48,259
check and make sure no like you know

1515
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:50,200
Trump keeps saying tomorrow that he

1516
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:52,430
didn't say what he said yesterday and

1517
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,589
nobody cares in the world of politics

1518
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,720
but if he had a block chain in a

1519
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:57,769
business people would say no we have the

1520
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,848
record that you said something else

1521
00:53:57,769 --> 00:54:03,078
yesterday it would matter yeah in

1522
00:54:01,849 --> 00:54:04,460
politics for some reason it doesn't

1523
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:07,009
matter but that's that's another

1524
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:09,319
psychological issue like everyone's fear

1525
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:11,059
of math they have some strange emotional

1526
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:16,308
attachment to someone who appears strong

1527
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:18,460
ready to make sense or not anyway what's

1528
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:18,460
that

1529
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:29,118
oh I teach a bunch of stuff but I do

1530
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:32,809
teach a cryptography class so let me

1531
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,160
bring up my classes here if you I did it

1532
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:37,099
for this reason I started doing all

1533
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,629
these security tests of various things I

1534
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:40,220
realized that people don't know the very

1535
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:42,079
fundamentals of cryptography at all

1536
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,270
which I thought was pretty obvious so I

1537
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,799
teach usual stuff like hacking and Alber

1538
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:47,660
analysis and exploit development and

1539
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:50,119
instant response but I also teach a

1540
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:52,730
cryptography class this is what's going

1541
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:55,220
on this semester and this is I see CDC

1542
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:56,540
course and then at the bottom I got

1543
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,040
what's coming on next semester which is

1544
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:00,710
here and I'll be doing the cryptography

1545
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,690
then and the hacking Android phones and

1546
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:04,280
securing web applications which is the

1547
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:06,079
web applications hacker's handbook and

1548
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,670
other teachers are now doing the

1549
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,260
forensics I used to teach another good

1550
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:11,059
guys taking that over so you know we're

1551
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:12,890
our apartment is growing and we got more

1552
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:15,200
people but the cryptography class is

1553
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:16,759
just plain mathematics class but it's

1554
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,078
not got any of the math that people are

1555
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,180
afraid of we don't have to do any proofs

1556
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,849
or anything it's engineering it's

1557
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:24,680
learning how to use cryptography I don't

1558
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:26,510
expect anybody to invent a new

1559
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,819
cryptographic system please don't even

1560
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:30,770
try there's no need

1561
00:55:28,819 --> 00:55:32,119
whatever you think you thought of that

1562
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:33,500
you think you're smart enough you're

1563
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:34,609
wrong that's all you're gonna learn is

1564
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,799
you're not as smart as you think you are

1565
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:38,089
the ten smartest people on earth have

1566
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:39,859
written cryptographic systems and the

1567
00:55:38,089 --> 00:55:43,339
rest of us just need to bow meekly at

1568
00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:44,839
their feet and use them if you think you

1569
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:47,990
invented something good you're wrong

1570
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:51,589
just use normal stuff like RSA and AES

1571
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:52,700
and sha-1 and saw - those things are

1572
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:54,410
there for a reason

1573
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,879
brilliant minds have put in there it's

1574
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:57,049
work and making those things better than

1575
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,260
anything you'd think of in the shower

1576
00:55:57,049 --> 00:56:01,819
and so but you do need to learn how to

1577
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,410
use them correctly and that's what this

1578
00:56:01,819 --> 00:56:04,940
is the engineer he's learning where's

1579
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:06,500
the key what keys are produced what

1580
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:13,599
should you do with the key that sort of

1581
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:13,599
thing yeah yeah

1582
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:20,570
well I did publish that and magazines

1583
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:22,010
and stuff Microsoft defended themselves

1584
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:23,270
the Microsoft developers that did this

1585
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:25,040
defended themselves when I published

1586
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:27,590
this in 2600 like six years ago

1587
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,120
and they said well you know we added a

1588
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:30,620
second layer of encryption on top of

1589
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,000
that to protect the password hashes

1590
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,560
that's what this is like you know you

1591
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,910
have a bucket with a hole in it so what

1592
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,310
you do is you put it in a bigger bucket

1593
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:39,649
it also has a hole in it um so they had

1594
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:41,480
they've used the crappy hash routine so

1595
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:43,250
to recover it they put reversible

1596
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,050
encryption on top of it and hit the key

1597
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:46,490
on the operating system so quickly

1598
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:48,740
people found the key they can get in so

1599
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:50,959
but that was their defense it's and it

1600
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:53,089
really shows to be fair it was a long

1601
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,830
time ago when people were naive but it's

1602
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:56,360
what most people do with encryption is

1603
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:57,710
they're like little kids just taking

1604
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,240
blocks and hammering with them without

1605
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:01,250
even knowing what they are they say Oh

1606
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,569
encryption ok paint bang bang I'm

1607
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:04,130
cutting the encryption Oh put any more

1608
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:05,720
encryption bang-bang-bang there the boss

1609
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,700
will like me more now they don't even

1610
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,689
understand what they're doing say take

1611
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,100
something broken and then they put

1612
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,540
another layer or something broken on top

1613
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,970
and they say they're it's all fine now

1614
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:16,040
and their boss apparently doesn't know

1615
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:18,290
enough to test that either which is what

1616
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:20,410
surprises me because you know managers

1617
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:22,940
have responsibilities I remember when

1618
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:24,529
was it target that got hacked because

1619
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:27,380
they had the vulnerability in their

1620
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:30,680
apache struts and i was targeted one of

1621
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:32,750
the other which one Equifax and the

1622
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,759
manager was interviewed and they said oh

1623
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:37,010
why that idiot didn't put on the update

1624
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:40,070
shame on him and I'm like dude you can't

1625
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:41,840
be saying that if your staff doesn't do

1626
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:43,940
their job right you can't say it was my

1627
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,710
staff it wasn't me you're the boss the

1628
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:47,330
question is why did you hire that idiots

1629
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:48,500
why didn't you train that idiot why

1630
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:50,420
didn't you give them a silhouette you're

1631
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,850
the boss you can outsource work but you

1632
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,620
cannot outsource responsibility if you

1633
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:56,690
lose the date of the managers must look

1634
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:59,210
you didn't run your company right and

1635
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:01,340
your staff lost the data you're guilty

1636
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:02,690
and you can't say my staff is

1637
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,760
incompetent because I questioned it well

1638
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:07,160
why did you hire incompetent staff and

1639
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,500
not review their work then so managers

1640
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,930
should be checking get answers to these

1641
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,420
basic questions what did you do with the

1642
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:16,220
key you know and they're not yeah just

1643
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,900
because they're all afraid of math so

1644
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,490
much there's my theory that they'll say

1645
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:22,930
oh well just believe anything you say

1646
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:25,930
please just make the math go away and

1647
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:25,930
yeah

1648
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:31,919
oki passion last best far as I know

1649
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:33,270
they're okay I know some of them got

1650
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,920
hacked it had volley bellies I use a

1651
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:37,080
password manager I got one of them up

1652
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,720
here I think is LastPass or something

1653
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,069
yes LastPass and they got hacked and

1654
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,930
they fixed it you know I think it's a

1655
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:44,940
good idea to use one of those things

1656
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:47,220
it's far better than reusing passwords

1657
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,780
which is the reasonable alternative so

1658
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,939
you should have a different password in

1659
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,440
every site because I look at what

1660
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:55,800
they're doing at the other end holy crap

1661
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,150
you're throwing in a plain text database

1662
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,860
with sequel injection at the other end

1663
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,480
so you have to have a different password

1664
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,470
everywhere because the people at the

1665
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,130
other end are just throwing it on the

1666
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:06,480
ground like trash and and I have the

1667
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:08,070
recommend password manager you should

1668
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,020
get one and get used to it you'll be a

1669
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:12,690
lot better off then than then trying to

1670
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:14,280
remember all your passwords of course a

1671
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:15,390
low-tech solution which is perfectly

1672
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,890
fine is write them all on a piece of

1673
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:18,240
paper and store that piece of paper

1674
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,740
where you keep your hundred dollar bills

1675
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,379
normal people know how to keep a piece

1676
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:24,299
of paper safe and and that's all right

1677
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:26,670
that's really that amounts to the same

1678
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:28,140
thing then you've got a different

1679
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:29,580
password at every site and you've store

1680
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:31,339
it somewhere safe that no one's going to

1681
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:33,779
steal on your computer that's not bad

1682
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,550
that's okay but this is the electronic

1683
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,230
version this is nicer for the electronic

1684
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:39,030
people are more happy using a computer

1685
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:40,710
to store facts but but whatever you

1686
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:42,200
don't reuse passwords that's really

1687
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:48,140
asking for it

1688
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:48,140
any others okay well I guess

1689
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:58,519
