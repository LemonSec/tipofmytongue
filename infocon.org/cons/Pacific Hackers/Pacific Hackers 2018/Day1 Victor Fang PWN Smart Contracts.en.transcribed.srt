1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
Princeton to to basically do the

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:09,080
business we're blockchain so without

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:14,419
further ado here's Victor fit

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:17,100
thank you rock thank you everyone so

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:21,529
yeah how many of you are known about

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,449
small contract raise your hand that's it

7
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:27,599
I'll make it more entertaining okay so

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:31,679
yeah it's a very new area in and that's

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,020
why exactly we quit the job from from

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,480
fire I'm Indian so today I'm gonna talk

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,940
about how to pounce my country and make

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,610
four million dollars in weeks okay and

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,809
this is happen like no Fargo okay

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:49,160
and we that's a four million dollars

15
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:53,309
that's a lot of money and that's rough

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,550
but talk about cash okay we're gonna

17
00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:00,289
talk about this how many of you know

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,440
that what it is raise your hand okay

19
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:05,729
cool

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,330
in Syria okay so it's a crypto currency

21
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,429
that is actually works like arm like US

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,979
dollars okay is even better that you can

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,830
actually execute smart contract which is

24
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,929
a piece of code that you can run in the

25
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,780
future and is running in a decentralized

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,500
network that everybody can verify okay

27
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,180
super cool technology and actually I

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,350
mean some of you are the real hackers

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,990
right even to see we're actually

30
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,960
launching this game today that if you're

31
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:37,380
interested in hacking this exchange that

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,070
we call TV exchange how many of you know

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:47,250
why we name it like this does it ring

34
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:52,229
the bell have you heard about tvw a TV

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,939
lwas off for 10 valuable web app ok I

36
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,450
think you guys need attended training

37
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,520
outside just kidding okay yeah I will

38
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,380
put a QR code later okay and you can

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,899
sign up for free the game will be

40
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,098
launched like within this month okay and

41
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:12,300
we're giving away our crypto currencies

42
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:13,560
okay okay briefly about myself I we

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,440
launched a company

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,989
inching AI in San Jose and just like a

45
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,599
few months are going to lie and we

46
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,750
invested by a post a Silicon Valley VCS

47
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,660
and also Wall Street hedge funds and

48
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:30,030
right before that I was from I'm Indian

49
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,760
the mandiant team FII and where I'm

50
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,580
responsible for the AI initiative FII

51
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,920
and as you can see the company liked me

52
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:42,120
a lot right well my face is on all the

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:50,929
eyes how many of you went to RSA this

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:55,350
year nobody security conference and and

55
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:58,140
so we actually FII help building the

56
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,690
some of the AI that was actually help

57
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:05,369
detecting one of the apt group called

58
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:08,579
apt 32 okay and in terms of my hobby I

59
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:12,120
play electric guitar and and my pig I'm

60
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,160
big fan of power Desmond but my teacher

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,250
told me to keep my day job yet

62
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,290
so hopefully I like I get rich or be

63
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,150
more successful one day and then I can

64
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:26,190
become a musician okay okay so today I'm

65
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,670
going to talk about apt how many of you

66
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,579
heard about apt awesome that's great

67
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,290
okay so apt as you may know right it's

68
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,620
the worst nightmare of cybersecurity

69
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,819
okay and it's all for the ones position

70
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,100
threat okay

71
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,069
it will means as stay OC and continuous

72
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,650
computer hacking that is usually

73
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:49,048
orchestrated and it targeted specific

74
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,600
entities okay it's not some random kids

75
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,389
that put put together some like what

76
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,888
trick where whatever right this is a

77
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:59,370
real the real deal

78
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:01,500
okay of no cybersecurity industry am I'm

79
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,880
very fortunate to work at a fire

80
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,850
maintained which is the team that

81
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,160
actually define apt and actually keep

82
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,250
track of all these abt groups starting

83
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,489
from a abt one back in 2013 and all the

84
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:19,560
way to the most rate latest one is apt

85
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:23,580
37 that's related to North Korea and the

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,620
one I helped was at apt 32 that is

87
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,120
related to a Viet Nam's

88
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,320
villainess

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:36,389
King okay and so I publish a block on

90
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:38,520
the fireside press you know and it's

91
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,250
some of my machine learning okay I was

92
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,349
actually this close in the five block

93
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,750
feel free to check it out and this

94
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:49,949
diagram over so I'll show you guys right

95
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,690
um apt right is actually a long process

96
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:54,270
and it can be combined with all

97
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:57,120
different hacking tools right it's not a

98
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,620
single hacking process if you look at it

99
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,889
right it comes with all these components

100
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,990
and steps okay and usually the apt can

101
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,990
stay in your cyber you're on in your

102
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,680
enterprise network for 250 days on

103
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,780
average that's ridiculous

104
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,190
okay now the question is is there

105
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:19,409
blockchain apt before I get into that

106
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,810
like to introduce you the T app is

107
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,580
called decentralized app okay it's

108
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,789
basically like a game but it's running

109
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,948
on the blockchain is they're totally

110
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:32,460
decentralized work ok how many of you

111
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:35,610
heard about for most Reedy ok good so

112
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,030
for most 3d so for fear of missing out

113
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,910
okay is a game boring app okay

114
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,979
the it works like this it's actually the

115
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,610
domain name is super funny is called xyx

116
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:50,610
can taught me okay yeah some of you are

117
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:54,360
laughing great so it's actually a top

118
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,910
one x cerium the app in july and it's so

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,020
popular that even congested the entire

120
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,880
exterior network okay and this this

121
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,409
little piece of smart concept or piece

122
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,969
of code there's only like less than two

123
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:10,680
thousand nine right it was actually

124
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,560
21,000 experian that was of more than

125
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,289
ten million dollars okay and those are

126
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,889
as I said right those are real money

127
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:23,340
okay and the game was like this is a UI

128
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:25,020
right you buy a key to participant again

129
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,750
right think about is a real game boring

130
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,049
app okay you can participate by buying a

131
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:34,380
key or key is like a lottery okay you

132
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:37,740
buy a lottery and there's a clock now

133
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,830
there I it's counting down okay so

134
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,159
whenever somebody buy a key the clock

135
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,800
way

136
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:46,830
rewind at like 10 seconds or something

137
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:51,569
like that okay and the winner would be

138
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:55,258
the guy who was the last one that plays

139
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,569
his key and the clock run to zero okay

140
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,279
that's a countdown clock right so I

141
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:00,569
think I'll just think about it simulated

142
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,179
in your mind right what's gonna happen

143
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:06,659
right when the clock go to almost zero

144
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:11,219
what's gonna happen any anybody want to

145
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:13,110
take a guess exactly that guy well a lot

146
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:16,589
of people were rushing and by because

147
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,929
everybody won't win ten million dollars

148
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:22,349
okay would you like to win ten million

149
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:28,169
dollars raise your hand if you want only

150
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:32,399
a few hands what's going ok well it's

151
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:33,318
going you guys all retired or what okay

152
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,699
I will okay

153
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:40,860
that's why I put my key this is my own

154
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:42,809
money okay and so and okay so if the

155
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,879
game runs like that it's not fun right

156
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:47,819
because it lasts for up to 24 hours

157
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,729
right and this game can go for months so

158
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,610
that to kind of increase the interaction

159
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:56,219
right the designer of this team actually

160
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,429
add one more feature that each key buyer

161
00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:01,498
will receive the random airdrop bonus is

162
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:03,448
something that Oh wanna bite it they

163
00:08:01,499 --> 00:08:05,339
have a random number generator see or

164
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,349
whether you are lucky or not okay if

165
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:10,559
you're lucky you get some return

166
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:13,079
immediately okay to kind of increase the

167
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:14,699
stickiness it's probably much like those

168
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,009
game like computer games and all that

169
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:20,699
okay

170
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:22,709
and unfortunately they are but in the

171
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,199
smart contract okay there's a few thing

172
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:27,719
I want to point it out okay

173
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:31,139
this mouse this smart contract has all

174
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:33,599
the source code puppies are on Syrian

175
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,549
Network okay everybody can see it and it

176
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,149
is only like less than 2,000 lines of

177
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:41,669
code it looks like JavaScript okay and

178
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:44,370
it's visible to everybody right even you

179
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:47,040
write a stupid bug or like a pigeon is

180
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,139
logic it's all transparent to everybody

181
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,670
okay - some of you maybe that's

182
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,559
embarrassing maybe you should just not

183
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,319
post your source code there just put a

184
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,269
pike oh okay

185
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,630
and the one thing I'll point out is this

186
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:02,930
piece of co-host ten million dollars

187
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:05,990
again ten million dollars was of SN is

188
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,709
hosted by this piece of code and there

189
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,360
are two bucks

190
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:12,349
okay now I'm showing you the real stuff

191
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,769
okay look at all the comments right the

192
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:18,709
top one day is there's a function call

193
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:25,279
what's that function name is human what

194
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:27,199
would that do exactly so this mark on

195
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,560
check the first thing they want to block

196
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:33,050
the pots from interesting who is this

197
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,550
game okay if you're designing a game you

198
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:39,349
better put that also but unfortunately

199
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,560
there's a bug in the piece of code that

200
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,589
the hacker can bypass it okay they can

201
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,329
fake it then they get to the next piece

202
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:49,940
of vision is logic okay

203
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:51,469
it's called airdrop remember what I just

204
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,290
talked about in the in the previous

205
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,420
slides right you can actually win the

206
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:59,540
lottery immediately if you are lucky

207
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:03,290
enough if you meet all this checking

208
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:07,670
okay then you will be the winner you

209
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,899
will get the reward immediately okay so

210
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:16,670
what's the problem with this piece of

211
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:18,410
code anybody want to try this is kidding

212
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,649
this is this is pretty tough okay

213
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:26,689
and actually the second part doesn't

214
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:29,750
have a bug okay but there's a problem

215
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,529
who is how what kind of hypothesis or

216
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:36,800
assumption that they are doing right so

217
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:39,439
exterior network takes about like 15

218
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,660
seconds to set all the transactions okay

219
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:46,370
but how much time we take to run this

220
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:50,240
piece of code microseconds exactly and

221
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:55,610
what would be the problem the co is

222
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:58,399
there right and all these guys all these

223
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,339
parameters right this is a pseudo number

224
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,329
generator right if you have a specific

225
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:07,579
input it's the root the output is always

226
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:08,660
deterministic okay that's the problem is

227
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,969
why you're walking too

228
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,779
the exam room to take an exam I already

229
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,220
know all the answers right this piece of

230
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:19,399
code is something that you can run

231
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,949
locally and you can only participate the

232
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,180
game when you make sure when you are

233
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:28,849
sure that you were gonna win

234
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:31,279
okay and based on our machine learning

235
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:34,069
and artificial intelligence engine right

236
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,560
we actually make a nai that predict all

237
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:38,660
the transactions what is a malicious

238
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,739
transaction or a regular participant

239
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:45,219
okay so we call it a lucky hackers the

240
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,310
reason we call it what we call it is

241
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:52,250
this group of hackers only contribute to

242
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:55,149
ten almost like 10% of the entire ten

243
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:59,660
sections okay but how much they make

244
00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:04,490
they make half of the dollar in the

245
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:07,550
prize poor super lucky if you if you use

246
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,160
your regular like a tool to participate

247
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:12,349
this game you will you were always rules

248
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,040
okay you almost always rules it is I

249
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:18,889
didn't wing any of our job randomly okay

250
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,069
and remember the advanced persistent

251
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:24,170
threat definition okay

252
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:27,889
other ones and persistent I remember

253
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:30,589
position this guy has a specific target

254
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:33,560
right it's a formal 3d smart contract

255
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:35,089
and this is how they behave the heck how

256
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,719
the heck are engaging with this game

257
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:41,810
okay this is actually when the first day

258
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,579
that the game launch is actually in July

259
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:49,160
the third or something like that okay

260
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:52,160
and each year each arm the curfew means

261
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,949
are the hourly attempt of the malicious

262
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,740
transaction as you can see Singh still

263
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:59,540
came long-stay they are already attempts

264
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,579
try to break it right

265
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:06,349
there's so many smart people in the

266
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:08,029
world okay and then here what would you

267
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:15,319
guess now what would you name it this

268
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:17,750
box here exactly are you a hacker looks

269
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:22,069
like you you look like a hacker maybe is

270
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:24,290
him okay so this is probably like like

271
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,060
all the hacking process right at the

272
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,920
beginning you will be people I tried to

273
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,469
poke poke it right you have to do it

274
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:35,599
right to poke it and then what happened

275
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:38,180
here there long said they found out oh

276
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,330
crap yes I found it I found the solution

277
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:45,140
to hack this smart contract then this

278
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:48,050
guy launched a huge hacking campaign

279
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,120
okay and he's using super like

280
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,770
sophisticated tool okay this is not by

281
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,620
human okay this is by a whole bunch of

282
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:58,430
bots that will rise my culture is like a

283
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:00,590
pot writing pot okay and it goes up to

284
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,079
like the hourly attacks goes up to like

285
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,540
one hundred and thirty two attacks per

286
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,900
hour that's ridiculous the exceeding

287
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:11,089
network is actually they the daily

288
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:14,510
transaction is already peak at work 1

289
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:17,510
million per day and this guy can launch

290
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:19,760
like just this is only one address by

291
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:23,900
the way this is only one tea app in the

292
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:30,680
entire genome network ok and then what

293
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:35,560
happened here why did they stop whether

294
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:47,329
I could stop take a guess what they stop

295
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:52,819
they retire because the money is gone ok

296
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:54,560
would you do it sounds easy right ok and

297
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,320
if you really do know to the transaction

298
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:02,329
again this is a whole public information

299
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,910
okay so that's the 90% return of

300
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:08,390
investment ok it's better than your 401k

301
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,829
for 4000 probably so it's complicated

302
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,310
okay again this is a super sophisticated

303
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:16,520
attack okay but all at the end of day

304
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:20,959
all you need to know is you put 0.1 X

305
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:24,050
cerium in and how much you get zero

306
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:28,160
point one night okay that stupid piece

307
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:31,520
of smart country will give you 0.09 more

308
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,870
exterior back to you because you win

309
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,870
that airdrop

310
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,800
so using our knowledge graph and machine

311
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,689
learning right this is actually what's

312
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,880
happening so on the top that's the game

313
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,760
contract they're hosting 10 million

314
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,100
dollars and now they're this little guy

315
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,590
right we call it the captain okay

316
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,290
I just checked this guy is still active

317
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:57,210
like three hours ago this guy is

318
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,949
probably here maybe is in the room I

319
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,630
don't know raise your hand if you you

320
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:05,190
are this guy now raise your hand if

321
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:08,120
you're not this guy I would tell you

322
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:13,350
that I won't tell you that sorry

323
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:16,110
so um and each stock in the knowledge

324
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,860
graph here right it's once mark is a is

325
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:24,020
one address in the exterior okay and in

326
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,970
the size means like the the that the the

327
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:32,730
value of the what exceed iam that they

328
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:37,940
hold okay and why is this we're okay

329
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,940
nobody's guess why is that weird

330
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,719
remember this smart culture right what

331
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:48,360
was the first thing they're checking in

332
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:50,580
this Mekons yeah he's human right and

333
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,040
each of those little dot there there's

334
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,900
actually 50,000 of them okay fifty

335
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,910
thousand or piece of my country are

336
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,600
running them and they try to attack this

337
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:03,959
guy each of them are one piece of CO in

338
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,449
the middle okay and we will check like

339
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,939
in August this guy this single wallet

340
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:12,030
they're like has one hundred and fifty

341
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:16,250
thousand dollars okay raise your hand if

342
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:20,300
you make less than that per year

343
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,300
[Laughter]

344
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:25,829
hey you guys are not farming i okay I

345
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,540
want to present this in a deaf con okay

346
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,940
I want you guys every of you out there

347
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:33,510
okay and we were holding a martini or

348
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:36,600
something anyway so um okay and remember

349
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,060
advanced persistent threat okay are the

350
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,909
ones this guy absolutely know what he's

351
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:45,000
doing okay as I said on the blockchain

352
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,640
right everything is transparent and if

353
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,750
you're not careful your attack will be

354
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,830
learned by other hacker

355
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:56,250
so what do they do self-destruct say

356
00:17:52,830 --> 00:18:02,010
louder say of this sure okay hit a

357
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:03,600
suicide so why why what do they do it so

358
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,460
nobody else know how they're hacking it

359
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,610
right yeah

360
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:14,460
so now we know the answer there's a

361
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:17,100
blockchain apt is already there okay

362
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,539
and this is our definition okay we're

363
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,139
the first team in the world that define

364
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:25,950
be apt okay the only thing that we add

365
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:28,559
is this hacker attack targeting approach

366
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:32,280
an entity okay it could be cerium it

367
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:35,700
could be a OS it could be anything and

368
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,830
this is all the 30,000 addresses they

369
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,559
involve and this is coming from like

370
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,360
about two million transactions that

371
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,840
involving who is interacting with this

372
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,189
scam

373
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:53,689
okay just within a few weeks okay and I

374
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:53,690
hope you stop recording all the edges

375
00:18:54,169 --> 00:19:02,820
all the edges is okay so on so you and

376
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,289
so you kind of like okay I hope I can

377
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,220
convince you that we're doing the real

378
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:12,330
stuff not some random graph okay okay

379
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:17,220
but that's not the end right they found

380
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:19,649
a new target okay you know China's has a

381
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,130
lot of copycats okay including smart

382
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:26,130
conscious so this game it's funny man

383
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:28,679
this is called the last winner okay and

384
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,690
you won't if you google it you won't be

385
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,130
able to fire a lot of them maybe now you

386
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,610
could go out you're gonna find our pub

387
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:38,400
our investigation report okay but nom

388
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:41,399
this game as a panel is an enjoy app

389
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,169
okay and it was exactly your I for most

390
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,720
readers what they say in the description

391
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:48,659
of the enjoy app okay let's say the game

392
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,799
works like for most 3d and what they do

393
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:55,760
is they took the call from for most 3d

394
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,760
okay a holster cam

395
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:02,380
unfortunately these guys are so lazy

396
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,210
that they didn't even bother to change

397
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,750
the code to fix the bar okay

398
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:09,820
similar biko same bugs I think the base

399
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,220
on our pie called reverse engineering

400
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,070
the only thing they added is probably

401
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,990
like those addresses that take taking

402
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,970
the money out to pay the developers

403
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,860
that's the only thing they change they

404
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,470
keep the rest of them and it's funny

405
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:28,870
enough this game was actually ran at the

406
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:31,780
top five tier being 2018 August 9

407
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:34,870
million dollars was of experiencing this

408
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:39,750
piece of copycat smart culture called

409
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:44,860
last winner publishing this and that's

410
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:46,450
the company so that same group of

411
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,479
hackers actually the two groups

412
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,910
okay each of them comes with is a group

413
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,600
okay it's not one individual this guy

414
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:57,370
walk together orchestrated and there's

415
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,030
about six edges that we call it a be a

416
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:03,639
PDF 3d and there's a five addresses

417
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:06,040
co-op will cover the pap dlw because I'm

418
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,800
from five I'm Indian okay we need to

419
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,440
call it something like that okay

420
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:16,510
so uh and it's funny enough that I

421
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:19,960
actually caught this guy and I think him

422
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:23,440
and say oh hey he was actually asking me

423
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:31,870
some very specific questions hey what

424
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:34,990
was that address okay so and now as you

425
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:37,149
meant as you may imagine right this is

426
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:40,690
the first time that in the world that we

427
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:43,210
published this and this article went

428
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,070
viral we started with a Chinese medium

429
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,810
because I'm Chinese okay and because the

430
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,540
last winner is reading in Chinese we

431
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:53,190
want to protect the Chinese community

432
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:57,430
not to be full by the p.m. okay

433
00:21:53,190 --> 00:22:00,450
immediately we got about like 50,000 for

434
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:04,150
words article report and all that and

435
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:07,150
and a lot of actually this guy his chief

436
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:09,550
architect of tension to the chief market

437
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:15,000
our chief blockchain architect of

438
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:18,040
and how many of you heard about war po7

439
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,570
hobby is the top sri Exchange in the

440
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:26,260
world and he's a CTO

441
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:28,870
how is the CTO of hobby anyways and the

442
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,790
one you just saw before was for most 3d

443
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:34,389
and this is the one called the last

444
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:37,470
winner right it's similar okay is

445
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:42,880
basically the same attacking tactics

446
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:48,400
because why why they so be similar same

447
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:50,860
Co n same group of people P apt hate the

448
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,860
top of this that the title of this toy

449
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:59,229
is be apt okay it's the same group of

450
00:22:53,860 --> 00:23:02,320
hackers and so I think at this point we

451
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:07,720
convince the VC to to invest in us okay

452
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:11,080
so thank you yes so this is because we

453
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,179
proved we have a system a product that

454
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,340
can actually have a repeatable success

455
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:17,890
this is another science project anymore

456
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,260
okay using our situational awareness

457
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,660
platform this is the timeline that how

458
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,309
we can detect it for the first time and

459
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:29,530
they will keep repeating detecting all

460
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:30,820
this okay and I reached OCS and how many

461
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:34,450
of you heard about him resource isn't

462
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:37,990
awesome she's well-connected by the way

463
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:42,090
that lady talked to her after my talk

464
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:45,809
and he's a seesaw of a Lending Club and

465
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:48,309
yeah so I think he just left right yeah

466
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,660
you guys have some smaller than single

467
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:52,149
own and you'll be careful

468
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,730
I need to be very careful yeah anyway

469
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:56,110
he's a nice guy you wrote the book how

470
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,240
to measure anything in cybersecurity

471
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:00,639
risk great book go buddy

472
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,280
okay he's my buddy so and this is what

473
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,309
he said about this kind of um the impact

474
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:10,770
of what our discovery that blockchain

475
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:14,800
apt could actually have a huge impact in

476
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:17,610
everybody right so as some of you may

477
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,918
know right maybe in less than two years

478
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:23,260
there will be option in our 401 K that

479
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,770
you can invest in Bitcoin each

480
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:29,140
f or exceed a meter of whatever okay it

481
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,670
may actually make you retire earlier

482
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,600
okay who knows

483
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:38,200
yes and with that the APD would be a

484
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,959
critical problem okay it's like what why

485
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:45,390
the Wall Street all the banks are so

486
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:49,870
concerned about apt right now okay and

487
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:54,490
this another guy from runs the PI to ALM

488
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:56,860
so he of the AI from web security he

489
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,330
wrote three books smart guy if you know

490
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,500
somebody who can publish three books

491
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:06,340
make friend wisdom okay and this is his

492
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:08,110
opinion okay blockchain situational

493
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:11,620
awareness would be a standard product

494
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:13,060
for financial Institute's just like why

495
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:22,600
people are buying those threat

496
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:25,330
intelligence today okay Wow okay I'm

497
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:29,199
talking about commercial stuff just

498
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:31,179
kidding so the mission so engineer I

499
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,280
won't we want to be the visa for proc

500
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:37,570
Chang okay I know that's a long shot but

501
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:40,510
this we have to have a bold target so

502
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:43,810
the VC you invest in us for those of you

503
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:49,090
want to be start a company yeah take

504
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:54,700
knows okay so on and our proactively

505
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:57,220
protect what change change sections and

506
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,680
let's look at the the media and all that

507
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:05,200
right how many of you heard about maple

508
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:08,670
change he's a Canadian crypto exchange

509
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,130
that just compromised two weeks ago okay

510
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:15,850
how many of you heard about finance

511
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:19,360
legend have you know Penance cool so

512
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:21,730
penis is the top one you know top one a

513
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:26,169
crypto exchanging the world all right CJ

514
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:30,310
is the CEO of that exchange and why do

515
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:34,780
they publish this and they say it twice

516
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:39,580
all funds are safe okay

517
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:42,340
and that fans are safe if facebook

518
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,679
google send you emails and oh hey your

519
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,409
data are safe are still safe although

520
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:52,840
there are some crazy news out there what

521
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:56,950
would you think okay so so we kind of we

522
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,560
published in some of those my sharing

523
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,480
article right block change security is

524
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,389
still super early okay

525
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,390
and in Wow am I right so there's three

526
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:10,090
critical problems three eternal seems

527
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:12,970
for blockchain security right and no

528
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:14,919
matter how blockchain evolve in my mind

529
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,280
those three pieces of problem will be

530
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,430
there

531
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,139
the first one is transaction security

532
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:22,630
protein is great because there's a lot

533
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,190
of transactions happening okay this is

534
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,830
like the payment system this is like

535
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,420
Visa this is like MasterCard right they

536
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,460
are variable because the people are

537
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,290
making transactions okay

538
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:36,280
and then the second one is the call

539
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:38,320
security I really like smart contract

540
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,190
this idea of smart culture it's great

541
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,500
this is actually revolutionary okay and

542
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,750
I mean not off you know about

543
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,850
smartphones yet today but I'm sure next

544
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,560
year maybe a lot of you will start

545
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:53,110
applying the table that can rise

546
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,540
solidity or whatever smart cons your

547
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,729
language and by the way solidity

548
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,770
engineers are the most highest pay as

549
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:03,400
being here in Silicon Valley right now

550
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:08,470
okay the outer ear a can go up to $1,000

551
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:10,960
per hour just FYI okay and then the

552
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,770
third one is infrastructures security

553
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,950
that's and that's also a big topic right

554
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:21,610
infrastructure meaning so protein

555
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,990
security actually is based on internet a

556
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:27,639
lot of them are based on internet right

557
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:30,370
so if your internet layer is not secure

558
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,670
right it's gonna break your blockchain

559
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:36,820
also right and also there's a lot of

560
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:39,040
mathematics get built into blockchain

561
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:43,240
right like the consensus algorithms

562
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:46,480
right P o WP o SP T POS and others right

563
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,429
so they're mathematics could be

564
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,610
vulnerable to right and those

565
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:54,309
all infrastructure security and we try

566
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,360
to be a company that protects all three

567
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:59,619
of them but we started with

568
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,019
transactional security okay and just to

569
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:04,350
give you a little bit of the market and

570
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:07,749
and some show you some numbers right

571
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,580
it's cerium transaction per day right

572
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:13,570
it's actually peak at one point five

573
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:15,189
meaning change section today that's I

574
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,710
mean right now exceeding M is still

575
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:20,049
growing you still a small blockchain

576
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:23,139
right it's only the number two of the

577
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:24,309
cryptocurrency but 11.5 million change

578
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:26,918
section in the world they are making

579
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:30,428
every day I think that's I think that's

580
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:34,749
that's a lot for now and there are

581
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:36,999
already 11,000 crypto exchanges in the

582
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:39,789
world although the top story is like

583
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:42,970
bananas hobby and okay exchange right

584
00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:46,950
but there's a lot of medium and it's a

585
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:50,470
super long tail distribution okay and

586
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:53,499
this entire crypto market cap it's

587
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:56,350
already three hundred billion dollars do

588
00:29:53,499 --> 00:30:01,179
you have idea what this number means the

589
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:04,748
entire net was security industry is only

590
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:07,419
eighty billion dollars a zero period

591
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:09,419
dollars if you add up all the companies

592
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:11,889
the cyber security company that you know

593
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:15,159
Symantec fireEye McAfee whatever header

594
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:18,519
map is only 88 0 this guy already have

595
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:23,619
300 pdn that's ridiculous

596
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:25,929
and it's real look at this is the one of

597
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:28,749
the website we keep keep a close eye on

598
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:30,159
right so this is all the T apps ok in

599
00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:32,710
this is website you don't need to take a

600
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:36,580
picture it's called the TF t ab radar

601
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:39,659
calm okay everything is there for most

602
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:42,749
is there it's not even the top one okay

603
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:45,970
and look at those like the top five

604
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:48,450
decentralized exchanges right there's so

605
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:55,029
many people are using this every day

606
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:57,009
already but what is that like today

607
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:59,769
right I just told you guys that this one

608
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:02,160
all this local together 300 billions

609
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:06,120
that's great but it's

610
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:08,760
just a beginning that thing that box up

611
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:13,560
there it looks exactly like the Internet

612
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:17,640
of 1990s how many of you can still

613
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:19,530
remember was internet like in 1990s one

614
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:24,720
though the lady doesn't need to raise

615
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:27,480
your hand so okay wow this is such a

616
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,370
young Club okay

617
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,420
as you remember I started using the

618
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:37,439
internet back in 1997 or something and

619
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:41,430
it costs at $50 per hour or per minute

620
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,420
or something is ridiculous and how many

621
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:48,090
of you know when those company founded

622
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:53,130
share micro mcafee Norton Symantec in

623
00:31:48,090 --> 00:32:00,270
order most of them were founded in 1988

624
00:31:53,130 --> 00:32:04,320
to 1992 why exactly because of this when

625
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:08,220
the internet become a critical mass that

626
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:12,810
industry will grow how about blockchain

627
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:15,420
security waste you early okay with you

628
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:17,730
super early and there's already a few

629
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,730
companies that there are 3000 means

630
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:24,210
channels is sacred and ancient how many

631
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:28,500
of the laws those logos you recognize at

632
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:34,560
least one right okay good some of you

633
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:36,450
are taking a neighbor so and I think

634
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,139
this one because most of you should know

635
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,910
okay

636
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:44,580
NIST the National Institute of Standards

637
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:49,050
and Technology is a US government agency

638
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:52,530
right this is the 2017 NIST

639
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:54,419
cybersecurity framework okay this is the

640
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:57,930
guideline from the US government that

641
00:32:54,420 --> 00:33:00,840
how we should do cybersecurity okay and

642
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:04,860
actually this is a gray role map for us

643
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:08,129
to create our company define our product

644
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,780
strategies okay five problems it's not

645
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:12,710
that complicated the entire eighty

646
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:15,580
billion dollar cybersecurity industry

647
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:18,039
try to solve these five problems

648
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:22,330
all right then if I take tech respond

649
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:25,509
protect recover that's it okay and so

650
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:27,730
right now first of all I identify we can

651
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:29,440
identify all the assets good guys or bad

652
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,090
guys in the entire blockchain that's

653
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,470
what I just showed you in the form of 3d

654
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:38,889
demo okay and detect once you're ready

655
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:40,690
for the assets right now you know what

656
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:44,168
are the critical assets it's like you

657
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:45,789
you are using an app to scan all your

658
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:48,580
enterprise network now you know oh

659
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:50,919
that's a printer okay and that's a

660
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:53,559
laptop and that's a server that server

661
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:54,509
host oh you'll see your documents and

662
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:57,399
all that okay

663
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:59,139
tic-tac now once you identify those

664
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:00,850
critical asset right you can protect

665
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:02,049
around them right so you can buy the

666
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,998
first thing you wanna do is pure

667
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:06,309
firewalls and all that by detecting all

668
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:09,299
these malicious transactions right and

669
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:13,418
one happens what would you do

670
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:15,759
respond okay that's gonna happen okay

671
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:18,339
and protect something that you can

672
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,139
actually add the layer to prevent

673
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:21,819
from happening in the future at least

674
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:26,379
the same should not happen again

675
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:28,808
okay and recover in recover we grayed

676
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:34,270
out because it's pretty tough to do

677
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:37,839
recover in blockchain in 2000 and 2016

678
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:39,940
right there's a huge security

679
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,719
vulnerability exterior that caused the

680
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:47,619
Inca exonym to fork okay so it's caused

681
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:49,359
by tau attack it cannot improve chain

682
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,710
right this is a series of chain section

683
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,418
that written in the block in the ledger

684
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,089
right it's really hard for you to

685
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:57,279
recover you can't but you can branch out

686
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:59,200
but when you branch out you need to have

687
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,599
the consensus of the community it's

688
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,520
paying the but okay that's why we cry

689
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,430
out we want to focus on the first form

690
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:11,170
problem and why not we we can identify

691
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:14,529
and detect with more money we can do the

692
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,299
protection as well so if any of you are

693
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,510
investors come talk to me we are going

694
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:22,569
to launch your series a real soon okay

695
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:24,220
so yeah so this is inside kind of to

696
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:25,869
give you a feeling of what our product

697
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,009
look like it's a basically a dashboard

698
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:32,040
is like a scene okay how many of you

699
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:34,650
sym yes I am awesome

700
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,170
now we are talking the same language so

701
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:39,500
so look think about is where buildings

702
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:43,020
are trying to buy beer seem for crypto

703
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:45,510
and how many of you heard about

704
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:50,100
situational awareness raise your hand

705
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:53,820
okay so I think that need to spend maybe

706
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:58,529
10 more minutes on these slides so it's

707
00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:01,200
actually is it's a concept proposed by

708
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:06,660
the US Air Force okay by this nice lady

709
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:09,120
there and back in 1995 okay and it has

710
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,759
those three aspects perception

711
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,069
comprehension and projection right and

712
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,290
this is what we're building in all the

713
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:20,370
DNA of our situational awareness

714
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:23,640
platform and chain and another product

715
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:28,200
we have it's called a caloric platform

716
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,330
okay so we try the one democratizing all

717
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,919
the smart country already how many of

718
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,150
you heard about smart kanji already

719
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:40,380
what would you order the smart contract

720
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:43,770
why I just told you so but with the

721
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,900
solve the problem so there's some

722
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:50,580
company in here I opened anybody from

723
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:54,420
open sampling or consensus no so those

724
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:58,380
company they charge you fifty thousand

725
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:01,080
dollars above to audit your smart

726
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,970
contract okay to look at it they're

727
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,259
great team by the way okay but the

728
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:08,220
problem is that we didn't solve the

729
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,470
problem no we actually look at all the

730
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,209
their legal document that you sign right

731
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,129
when you engage with them in legal

732
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:17,040
document his car is covered up to

733
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:20,490
installment anybody know was that for

734
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:24,210
that mean cover up doing storming they

735
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:26,759
don't don't publish this section that

736
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:29,700
means when happened I give you

737
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,040
money back up to whatever I tell you I

738
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:35,490
remember how much money was stolen in

739
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,990
this small contract four million dollars

740
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,990
in four weeks okay

741
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:57,639
how upset again sorry oh so for example

742
00:37:54,429 --> 00:38:00,429
gambling and gambling okay

743
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:03,699
and going forward right it could be

744
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:08,139
influenced you think about insurance was

745
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:10,329
insurance wealth what State Farm

746
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:12,549
promise you that all when your house got

747
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:15,599
damaged I will page you parable habla

748
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:18,579
okay what is that he's a piece of code

749
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,949
okay and right now I mean some of you

750
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:23,019
men may may hate dealing with the

751
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:25,419
insurance company I hate dealing with

752
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:27,698
those guys you spend one hour talking

753
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:29,529
away one two three yeah there's a oh

754
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:32,169
crap I'm not gonna page you because you

755
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:43,989
probable all that right that happened

756
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:47,769
before I have a not of them so Bitcoin

757
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:49,869
doesn't have I the concept of smart

758
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:52,508
conscious Bitcoin is a pure like a

759
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:54,549
peer-to-peer chance action but that's

760
00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:56,559
the first generation of blockchain okay

761
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:58,929
now we're at the second generation of

762
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,969
blockchain called serum and there's a

763
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:03,219
few others right cos and there's a

764
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:05,619
there's a twenty companies in the

765
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:07,959
Silicon Valley here now are building the

766
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:09,689
third generation of proxy and they ask

767
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:12,299
you I cannot wrap my head around but

768
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:15,038
smart culture is going to stake there

769
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:17,729
because this is the it's going to

770
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:20,189
revolutionize how the internet works

771
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:22,569
okay that doesn't answer your question

772
00:39:20,189 --> 00:39:26,529
and actually you can go back to what

773
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:27,819
that the app radar website right yeah I

774
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:30,959
think this one we answer your questions

775
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:36,239
of games collectibles

776
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:36,239
gambling's exchange market prices

777
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:57,819
yeah civic question a very great

778
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,220
question okay so that relates to the

779
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:03,549
infrastructure security I talked about

780
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:06,430
okay so facility what that means is a

781
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:09,759
smart college actually cryptocurrency is

782
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:12,970
nothing but a piece of information okay

783
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,240
it comes with your public address and

784
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:17,980
your private key public edges is like a

785
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,709
panga count that you can take somebody

786
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,420
that oh hey I can wire money to these

787
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,040
edges and you will receive it and the

788
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,390
private key is like your password to

789
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:32,020
your bank account okay if you lost the

790
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:34,029
private key then you are done everybody

791
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,460
in the world can take the money away

792
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,000
from you so that different ways of being

793
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,180
hacked

794
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,309
okay so like losing the private key

795
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,290
that's the worst

796
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:46,059
nothing can recover from that okay once

797
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,029
your private key is gone it's gone it's

798
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:51,790
done okay but I mean nowadays there's

799
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:55,119
also how how where world is in order

800
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:58,390
that can help you secure your Europe

801
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:02,940
like your asset by not leaking out all

802
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:10,589
those digits out it's in the USB Drive

803
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:10,589
yeah yeah like how we're wallet

804
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:25,030
different there's a different ways to

805
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,980
lost your phone right in the crypto like

806
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,079
losing the private key that's the worst

807
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,059
right and it could be like simply like

808
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:34,420
you leak your password or something of

809
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:37,299
your password protection and then

810
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:40,390
somebody else can steal that from from

811
00:41:37,299 --> 00:41:44,280
your wallet okay yeah we can tow that

812
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:44,279
later that's actually just a huge topic

813
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:57,210
there yes very good question and that's

814
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,220
not rocket science

815
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:04,380
how many edges are there in a serum

816
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:06,419
Network 100 million I can match them up

817
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,440
I can do a proof false easy we actually

818
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,980
do it every day

819
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:23,070
by the way that's our side business

820
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:26,610
don't recall that so we actually have

821
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:29,760
this one we try to screw up on Zeppelin

822
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,600
ok by launching this for free almost

823
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,780
free

824
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,310
we pure it into a product that we can

825
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,680
actually scan all the known

826
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:42,180
vulnerabilities on the in the smart

827
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:45,660
culture ok so if I for example we

828
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:47,190
already scan 40,000 smart contract

829
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,680
that's all the smart culture

830
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:53,010
sitting there all those exceed network

831
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,560
ok and we can we can detect all those

832
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,870
known vulnerabilities like re-entrance e

833
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,029
and overflow and there's a each of those

834
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:02,460
vulnerability is like a lawsuit they

835
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,620
have a story attached to it ok

836
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,140
there's only 20 of them 20 different

837
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:11,009
kinds of vulnerabilities we can scan

838
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:13,379
order in this free tool ok so if you

839
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:18,030
interested you know sign up our website

840

put a no offense this is a real story

845
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:43,160
ok this block chain is called spanking

846
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:48,570
check it out great company very loving

847
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:49,799
I'm serious by the way spanking expand

848
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:52,550
and that's what they law in their

849
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,550
website ok

850
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:58,500
yeah you can learn about their business

851
00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:01,799
later ok that's not this our scope

852
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,570
but like I said they've got screw just

853
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,540
like sweet weeks ago okay

854
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:11,400
they're bad guys told those how and

855
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:14,730
money they stole $38,000 from this poor

856
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,900
little Adele video servicing company

857
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:22,500
great company and again we take this

858
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,450
piece of code and in our culture

859
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:29,160
auditing platform he only takes how many

860
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:31,080
seconds forty nine point one second less

861
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,560
than one minute we scan all those

862
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:36,180
vulnerabilities okay and this guy they

863
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,040
report their books they call screw

864
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,259
because they have this reentrant see

865
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,770
vulnerability that's what caused it

866
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:46,470
cerium to back in 2016 there's new

867
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:49,170
people writing stupid code having that

868
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:51,390
same bug well that's why I like

869
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:56,700
cybersecurity and protein security okay

870
00:44:51,390 --> 00:45:03,529
and actually a few more bugs in the

871
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:08,520
smoke on check and if you get your call

872
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:11,640
audited or scan in advance right

873
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:15,570
you only take them one minute to use our

874
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,970
product just to tell them that oh hey

875
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:20,730
you you you better not launch it on the

876
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,109
main name okay you launch you cannot

877
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,050
test innate but not for maintenance

878
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:27,750
because we have those five

879
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:29,849
vulnerabilities they can save the lost

880
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,040
from the 30 a thousand dollars lost

881
00:45:29,849 --> 00:45:33,990
again those harm money okay you know

882
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:38,200
those money well where does money coming

883
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:43,209
from right and all videos

884
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:43,210
[Laughter]

885
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:53,670
boom factory we like commercial time -

886
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,230
ball and SDK and like a wallet that you

887
00:45:53,670 --> 00:46:05,250
can check the address before you

888
00:45:55,230 --> 00:46:08,130
actually say money up so thank you broke

889
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:10,320
chain ecosystems security away industry

890
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:12,160
standard that's the first I recall they

891
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,809
were paper is on our mediums

892
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,890
you know that's the day we launched our

893
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:20,140
company and again don't forget to sign

894
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:22,270
up this game so we just launched it here

895
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:25,480
today and then start signing up the game

896
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:47,079
we started on in a few weeks okay

897
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:48,730
yeah thank you yeah okay question so

898
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,369
okay right now I think you raised a very

899
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:53,559
good point okay so in the XE reom

900
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:55,780
there's a er c20 that's the standard of

901
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:58,000
that right and there's a er see a 721

902
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,920
that's a significant so right now yeah

903
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,619
we're thinking about doing a 731 later

904
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,930
but right now what is really helpful is

905
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:06,789
just the report over send you the report

906
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,169
and tells you that all those one two

907
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:10,150
three four five are the problem they

908
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:12,250
need a fix and you fix it and they you

909
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:14,799
launch and you Cooper we can go back to

910
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:16,869
us we'll give you another free scan okay

911
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:19,599
and that's how right now how our

912
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:27,180
business model works so we start with

913
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:27,180
free so yeah any more questions

914
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:39,849
yeah two products situational awareness

915
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,710
platform to detect all the transactions

916
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:43,210
to see whether the malicious transaction

917
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:47,490
or not right is more like a dashboard

918
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:47,490
and also smart conscious auditing

919
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,609
it's actually a domestic about proteins

920
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:15,220
all the same sections are sitting there

921
00:47:59,609 --> 00:48:17,890
on the legend yeah every all the

922
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:21,459
transactions happen where for the six

923
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:26,589
million worth of excuse we have all ten

924
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:28,809
billion transactions right go into all

925
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:32,979
those transaction analyze and servicing

926
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:35,549
up what's what you should Canada yeah

927
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:49,509
that's like it's like a - boy it's like

928
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:51,579
cybersecurity see one day that's easy

929
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:55,569
it's actually only like one less than

930
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:58,269
200 people spice that's it that's it

931
00:48:55,569 --> 00:49:14,940
Shiva you're like okay this this video

932
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:14,939
guy can stop
