1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:07,980
okay we're talk about how to fix

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,740
diversity gap in cybersecurity which we

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,509
know is kind of an issue right now so if

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,429
we're gonna kind of go through some

5
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,870
agenda thing but first we're going to

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,529
talk about Who am I kiss your probably

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,910
wondering who I am some statistics then

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,800
we're gonna go into some cognitive

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,369
science and then we're gonna do a quick

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,560
little activity and then a little bit of

11
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,340
storytelling and then I promise that

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,570
you'll walk away with some Q&A

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:38,040
possibilities but also three takeaways

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:41,969
of what you can do in your own office so

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,379
first thing is Who am I so since I was

16
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,410
about five years old I wanted to do

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:49,260
something which encouraged equality so I

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,828
thought that was education with kids and

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,930
I still do that today my background is

20
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,920
that I have a bachelor's in

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,210
international relations I have a

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,050
master's in science and political

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,239
research and then I have ten years of

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,330
nonprofit experience before actually

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,048
going into cyber security so it gave me

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,420
a very different feel of everything I do

27
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,520
sit on numerous different boards that

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,450
are humanitarian but majority of them

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,939
are somehow related to kids equality

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,360
through education and health

31
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,970
I do mentor and give talks about how to

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,189
break down barriers and walls these are

33
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,960
some of the students that I actually got

34
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:37,770
to mentor recently at a conference back

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,699
in UC Berkeley in June about trying to

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,130
get them interested in cybersecurity and

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,729
then I also like to do blogging I do

38
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,548
have a nonprofit called rap labels and I

39
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,158
also had now cyber Lai's which starts in

40
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:59,030
January which was actually started in

41
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,030
Israel at least I worked at bugcrowd

42
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:09,199
so overall women make only 11% in the

43
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:12,500
cybersecurity forest this is Ben says

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,849
2013 and has remained unchanged

45
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,160
minorities on the other hand is less

46
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:20,369
than 12% make up the cyber security

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,250
force and we're looking at a one point

48
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:27,269
five million shortage of cybersecurity

49
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,860
professionals and most likely this is

50
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:31,230
the worst part of it all is that

51
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,610
underrepresented persons are always the

52
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:39,660
most likely to be let go or fired so

53
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:42,060
let's dive into some facts but first

54
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,220
more companies are realizing that the

55
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,890
only way to get great people is to

56
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,410
invest in workforce diversity and social

57
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,958
responsibility companies seeking to

58
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,700
become more inclusive in their hiring

59
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,000
should examine and question their own

60
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:01,649
assumptions and unintentional biases in

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,530
their hiring process so I'm going to

62
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,850
show you a quick video and I want you to

63
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,459
try to listen as much as possible

64
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:12,470
without trying to think at the same time

65
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,470
and no that's tricky but try

66
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,749
[Music]

67
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,710
[Music]

68
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,239
[Music]

69
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,380
so yeah that was definitely a push to go

70
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:13,040
check out my nonprofit no but on other

71
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,230
notes is that this is another one of

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,738
those moments were your first thinking

73
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,570
of like okay I just heard your story now

74
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,789
the next thing you need to get to in

75
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,150
life which is very hard when thinking is

76
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,730
what am i doing that's causing this guy

77
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,469
to have these issues still and you might

78
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,100
not even know that yet you might not

79
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,750
even think about that yet until maybe

80
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,520
one of those days where you're in the

81
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,140
elevator and you're fighting yourself

82
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,750
clutching your purse a little bit

83
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,700
tighter or believe it or not when you're

84
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,620
driving in an area you decide you know

85
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,700
what if you like locking the car doors

86
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,260
for a reason so let's break down how

87
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,800
that works in our brains

88
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:59,240
so first is we are afraid and we act on

89
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,860
our fear so how this works is in a part

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,690
called the amygdala it's where we're

91
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,960
programmed to sort who is like us and

92
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:09,410
who is not like us and this occurs

93
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,510
unconsciously and at the same time it

94
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,120
could be something of a survival

95
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,370
mechanism of our potential threats and

96
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,710
these tend to be stemmed from like our

97
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,800
socially constructed beliefs and norms

98
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,560
you know ever since like you say you

99
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,060
watch some movies or documentaries or

100
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,950
you have parents that said don't hang

101
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,720
out with the kid next door and

102
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,310
you're like why because they have pink

103
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,560
hair don't trust people they ain't care

104
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,570
now you're always gonna think about this

105
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,920
later on in life unconsciously that I

106
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,520
will always be afraid of a person with

107
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,040
pink hair but the good news is that it's

108
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,370
always verified so in the frontal lobe

109
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,650
it actually perceives and checks in with

110
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,840
the amygdala so the Migdal is like will

111
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,609
be afraid be afraid the prefrontal

112
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,969
cortex can actually turn around and be

113
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,140
like you know what you need a chill and

114
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,690
let me tell you why I need a chill and

115
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,669
the reason for that is because one we

116
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,310
just heard of a story of some guy saying

117
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,470
you know sometimes people clutch the

118
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:10,790
purse a little bit tighter because of a

119
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:12,800
stereotype that is false next thing that

120
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,020
happens is is that you're questioning

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,820
the stereotype this belief and then you

122
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,950
end up making the final decision so

123
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:24,200
think of the prefrontal cortex as a CEO

124
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:26,030
it makes the final call and then last

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,370
but not least then it turns into action

126
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:32,510
the prefrontal cortex let's know what's

127
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,850
the next step so just note overall you

128
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,010
can always question your own biases and

129
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,540
it's really okay to be uncomfortable I

130
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,070
know that's the worst thing ever to

131
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,340
actually look at ourselves and see like

132
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:45,230
what did I do wrong here but at the same

133
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,909
time it's the way that we learn from

134
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,460
each other we get out of our comfort

135
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,240
bubble with each other and that's how we

136
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,400
actually make changes happen so we're

137
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,920
gonna do a quick activity I want you to

138
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:15,500
sit next to someone you don't really

139
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:18,530
know so not quite yet so the first thing

140
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,480
you're gonna do is this is gonna be

141
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,559
maybe uncomfortable for you but I

142
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,510
promise you you're gonna find a lot

143
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,010
about yourself and your thinking and

144
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,870
also you're gonna learn a lot about this

145
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:34,010
new person you're sitting next to so

146
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,900
what I want you to do is someone say hey

147
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,670
the other person is B to the other

148
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,849
person I agree who's a and B let's just

149
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,850
do that

150
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:47,140
all right we've all sorted it out okay

151
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,690
so now the next step is whoever said

152
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:53,979
they're gonna be a you're gonna talk for

153
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:55,900
five minutes about anything you want

154
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:59,350
about anything you want

155
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,270
now person B you're gonna just listen

156
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,370
and now anytime you catch yourself

157
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,950
thinking I want you to go back to like

158
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,500
no no no pay attention don't question

159
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,090
you can't ask anything you have to let

160
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,760
the person talk the whole entire time

161
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,000
you can nod your head but you cannot

162
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,490
talk you cannot ask for further things

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,320
you have to just listen now I'm going to

164
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:25,620
set the timer for five minutes ready set

165
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,620
go

166
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,129

[Music]

208
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:55,390
and time okay so that must have been

209
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:57,070
very awkward usually I worry this is

210
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,350
like the first two to three minutes

211
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,330
you're just like well if you're the

212
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,070
first person speaking you're like oh my

213
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,629
god what am I gonna talk about it so

214
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,580
then you go down like this rabbit hole

215
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:10,300
where you start getting really serious

216
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:12,040
very fast you get really like oh my god

217
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,230
I can't believe it just totally stranger

218
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,059
this oh my god

219
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,040
and then the other person who's

220
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:21,220
listening it's always like the first few

221
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,659
minutes you're like stop thinking why

222
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,610
don't you want to ask oh yeah I have

223
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,710
that same - oh wait what am I do

224
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,139
No pay attention pay attention and then

225
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,270
you've drift away like oh god here we do

226
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:37,990
it again what were some of the things

227
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:39,309
that you guys felt or better yet tell me

228
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:48,900
how did you feel about doing that

229
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:48,899
exercise or that activity Yeah right

230
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:59,350
what else yeah did we get really deep

231
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:08,320
somehow at 4-minute a little too deep

232
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:10,678
ooh that is a good question how the car

233
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,750
says you would be a bit different right

234
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:16,240
good okay you can stay in there Sam sees

235
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,970
if you like it's up to you all right

236
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,679
so there are not as many minority cyber

237
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,800
security professionals in the community

238
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,480
or in movies did you pick those roles

239
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,730
the minority cyber security

240
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,620
professionals that I know made a career

241
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,210
switch to pursue technology after

242
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,689
leaving the cyber security industry

243
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:38,290
unfortunately this is very much true

244
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,450
and the reason for that is that they're

245
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,070
not being heard they're not getting the

246
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,690
titles they want they're not getting the

247
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,470
pay that they're supposed to be getting

248
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:49,150
so what ends up happening and they leave

249
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:52,810
so I'm gonna tell a few stories at

250
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:55,990
different people that I interviewed so

251
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:59,320
one is named Rebecca Rebecca sassy so

252
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:02,500
Rebecca has over heard the board several

253
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:05,530
times saying oh she's not technical

254
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,690
enough no we can't hire her because she

255
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,280
has she's not that good at what she's

256
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,680
probably knows what to do because she's

257
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,720
technically challenged you know woman

258
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,460
might be an engineer for a long time has

259
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,420
been in cybersecurity for like ten years

260
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,430
somehow she's still not technical enough

261
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,500
rémi who's a salesperson complain about

262
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,750
the broad culture at her company and

263
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,010
within a month she was let go and the

264
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,990
reason for that was that the borough

265
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:31,660
culture star I gained a little bit more

266
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:36,460
and more intense and they kept hiring

267
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:38,800
more men instead of women and yeah which

268
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,810
unfortunately she got laid off because

269
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,040
of it died who's in sales she was she

270
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,710
asked for a raise because she was her

271
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,200
top sales performers for a few years and

272
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,360
what end up happening was that when she

273
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,950
went to you talk to her manager her

274
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,320
managers like sorry I cannot give you a

275
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:59,320
raise because if I do then everyone's

276
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,320
gonna think that I am trying to give to

277
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,610
someone from the same races I am and

278
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,409
she's a chinese-american he's

279
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,209
chinese-american so he said to her I

280
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,220
can't give you a raise because that but

281
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,830
then he ended up giving a raise to a

282
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:19,420
male colleague who underperformed her

283
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:21,699
who is also chinese-american clio who's

284
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:24,870
in marketing what happened was she

285
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,250
starts seeing a shift she was like

286
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:29,500
basically she was at a company for a

287
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,090
while she was doing a lot of things from

288
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,760
marketing and when I end up happening

289
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,129
and they kept hiring some kept hiring

290
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,050
men on this team so she ended up being

291
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,900
the only woman and she kept walking by

292
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:42,820
meetings and lunches that ended up not

293
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,980
having her included even though she had

294
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,450
the same title as them but she also

295
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,580
noticed I want should we go into their

296
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:52,450
office or a meeting

297
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:55,029
they would always say hey Cleo can you

298
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:57,759
dial in or Cleo can you take down notes

299
00:22:55,029 --> 00:23:02,109
even though it wasn't her meeting to do

300
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:06,339
that Anthony he's actually a designer

301
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:08,408
and believe it or not and his company

302
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:11,739
they decided they want to throw a hip

303
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:14,019
hop party we're basically ahead on the

304
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:17,229
pamphlet itself it's okay to have

305
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:19,450
cornrows to dress up listen to rap and

306
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,669
hip hop music and this is the same

307
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,279
company that decided they didn't want to

308
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:28,269
celebrate MLK day off that they can use

309
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:30,940
their paid time off instead Tania a

310
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:34,599
security manager she's been in this

311
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:39,669
field for 20 years and she left to go

312
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:43,089
work for a tech company and because she

313
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:45,070
could not go past the title of manager

314
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:49,089
and she's african-american

315
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:51,729
a woman 20 years at a company that's

316
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:54,339
very well known and and it's just

317
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:56,200
unfortunate because she's someone who

318
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:59,399
gives back so much to the community and

319
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,869
she can't even go past a manager title

320
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:04,089
Rita a pen tester she's actually

321
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:06,759
applying for work and the first thing

322
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:09,309
she told me that I look at is to see who

323
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:12,099
is on the board if there's a woman on

324
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:15,519
the board that is not HR she will apply

325
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:19,979
if there isn't a woman she's like I do

326
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:22,629
not want to climb up that hill

327
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:23,469
the other one is Frank Frank is

328
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,449
african-american

329
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:28,359
he works for NATO for their security and

330
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:30,669
he told me he has never taken one day

331
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:32,678
off and the reason for that is because

332
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:35,079
he's the only African American male and

333
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:37,450
his team and he's worried if he takes

334
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:39,940
one day off someone will say something

335
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:45,279
and say that he's not doing a good job

336
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:47,709
because he took a day off so from

337
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,709
stories it changes our perspectives and

338
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:53,950
beliefs and also can remove blindfolds

339
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:56,559
bring awareness and overall it can make

340
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,779
us really uncomfortable because the best

341
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,928
part about stories is when it questions

342
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:05,429
yourself what am i doing

343
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:09,269
that's making this situation continuing

344
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:12,789
so how do we apply this to solve the gap

345
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:14,860
well one you can speak up and push your

346
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:16,720
company to have more diverse execs and

347
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:22,149
board members sometimes that works

348
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:24,519
sometimes it really doesn't you can also

349
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:26,199
do a start early to promote the field so

350
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,330
this was taken from a cybersecurity

351
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,659
conference which had a bunch of kids

352
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:37,059
from East Bay to try to get them into

353
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:40,570
cybersecurity and this is one of my

354
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:43,090
students that I got to mentor during

355
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,158
that time and he actually did a

356
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:51,869
spoken-word thing that you guys get to

357
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:51,869
hear if it works okay here we go

358
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:21,209
[Music]

359
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:42,710
[Music]

360
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:45,960
[Applause]

361
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:48,570
so this this kid right here he's

362
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,650
actually he's a well he's like one of

363
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:54,629
those students that like is he loves

364
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,900
everything and all the times they can't

365
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:00,090
focus on one thing in particular and

366
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,920
he's also kind of quote-unquote he

367
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,020
doesn't call him a troublemaker but in

368
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,270
reality what he had was a rebellious

369
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,879
streak and what he liked to do was

370
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:12,320
trying to figure out how to like break

371
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,700
into classrooms and how to unlock things

372
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,580
sounds like kind of like our culture a

373
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,470
little bit here right so I connected him

374
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,740
with a hacker and now he's learning

375
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:26,970
Python believe it or not and that's what

376
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:29,430
he wants to hear so the other thing is

377
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,170
you can attend conferences that empower

378
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,940
underrepresented persons it doesn't

379
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,960
matter if his day of Shaqiri which is

380
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,230
like on my laptop

381
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,000
yes I know David security is a great

382
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:43,350
conference it was for a bunch of women

383
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,200
um over 200 women uh came to this

384
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:51,270
conference and it was wonderful but also

385
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:54,470
what we needed to see was more men even

386
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:57,690
if it says you know they are she curity

387
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:00,150
still come so go because it shows that

388
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,010
you care about women being in the field

389
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:06,210
and women need to see that more than

390
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:08,970
ever before also there's other types of

391
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,850
organizations that are doing conferences

392
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:14,040
you have the Diana you also have oh

393
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:15,810
there's just so many especially during

394
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,389
DEFCON there's like all these like will

395
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:22,250
small ones like hacking diversity is one

396
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:24,420
of them I highly recommend going to them

397
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:26,880
also get involved in outreach

398
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,740
participating volunteering like those

399
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,580
students that you saw on those pictures

400
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:35,430
from East Oakland they have you can

401
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:39,750
actually get involved and push your

402
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:42,060
company to get involved too now remember

403
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,690
when I said you can go up to your board

404
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,240
or you could go to the CEO or the sea

405
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,280
levels or why not

406
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,530
that's a little bit tricky but you can

407
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,050
go to your managers or get other people

408
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:56,510
at your company to recruit them come

409
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,010
onboard and you do volunteer in over the

410
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,320
weekend then post a bunch of photos on

411
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,480
slack I swear to god what ends up

412
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,000
happening is the HR person will see them

413
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,280
be like huh this is a good idea we

414
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,990
should be doing this more marketing it's

415
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,510
gonna love it because you're like we got

416
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:14,540
to do this more people like people that

417
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,410
like people so I mean this is a great

418
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,710
opportunity

419
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:21,740
push your work to volunteer there's

420
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:24,590
black girls code there's there's hidden

421
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:26,840
geniuses there's tons of organizations

422
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,899
and if you are still don't know where to

423
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:33,550
go and volunteer come and let me know I

424
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:36,200
will let you know what organizations now

425
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:38,629
most importantly though I hope from the

426
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,309
exercise and a little bit before diving

427
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,080
into our brains and what not but the

428
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:43,639
this start really does looking at

429
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,178
yourself in the mirror what am I doing

430
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:51,170
here how can I make things better and

431
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:53,380
also share the stories the stories that

432
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:56,210
you hear from other people share that

433
00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:00,110
because stories are life-changing to a

434
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:02,390
certain extent so the three takeaways

435
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:05,030
like I promised is personal stories are

436
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,580
powerful push your company and increase

437
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:09,620
the their diverse talent by volunteering

438
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:12,678
sponsoring and listening in return

439
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,030
awareness can happen and last but not

440
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:18,429
least allow yourself to become

441
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:21,889
uncomfortable and vulnerable and lastly

442
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:23,450
it is only with the heart that one can

443
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:26,540
see rightly what is essential is

444
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:28,580
invisible to the eyes yes as you

445
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,350
probably know us a lot of slides happen

446
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,240
to have a little prince in it because

447
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:35,540
this happens to be my favorite book I

448
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,600
even loved foxes but you'll see on the

449
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:41,139
next slide on the questions any

450
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,139
questions

451
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,439
[Music]

452
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:55,260
so a lot of the reactions is one the

453
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:57,330
person it gets if it if it's like right

454
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,620
after my talk or whatnot sometimes a

455
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,659
little message me the saying I'm really

456
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,389
worried someone is gonna share my story

457
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,490
and I didn't want them to share that and

458
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:08,220
then I remind her that it's a safe space

459
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:11,430
but also you're her story probably is

460
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,470
gonna change someone else's story that's

461
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,970
one the other thing is that they felt

462
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,010
really really uncomfortable and nervous

463
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,530
for the first two three minutes but then

464
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:21,840
I started realizing that somehow

465
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:25,830
something triggered where they felt

466
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,780
morally also brings two strangers really

467
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:31,199
close really fast that's the other

468
00:31:27,780 --> 00:32:05,010
things I usually hear any other

469
00:31:31,200 --> 00:32:10,080
questions yes you brought up the concept

470
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:13,980
of business people of this core set of

471
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,080
beliefs they vary the uplinks president

472
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,690
very hard to change and you have this

473
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,689
more dynamic set that's tends to persist

474
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:23,000
for a few years or whatever and handy

475
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,319
buddy

476
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,319

477
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:48,629

00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,519

[Music]

483
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:42,600
yeah well I mean okay so going to the me

484
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,429
to movement really fast on that um well

485
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,500
the thing is is that even though it's

486
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,390
gained more attention than ever before I

487
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,180
would say definitely with social media

488
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:53,550
the one thing for sure is that still

489
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:55,380
prosecution in itself is not it hasn't

490
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:59,669
really changed as much and we have seen

491
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:02,970
that now today unfortunately now when it

492
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:05,310
comes to understanding another person I

493
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,750
think when we get out of our comfort

494
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,929
bubble especially like if you're

495
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,370
traveling or whatnot and actually just

496
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,139
getting out of your comfort bubble you

497
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,670
start learning a lot more about the

498
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,400
world we live in and the people that are

499
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:20,130
in it so one of the things is that I

500
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,410
worked with some special kids special ed

501
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,030
kids and sometimes there's always this

502
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,489
belief in the textbook that like oh a

503
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:29,460
song with like who's extremely autistic

504
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:31,290
high on the spectrum that they're just

505
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,720
all over the place they could be violent

506
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,940
and whatnot I sent X to akin I worked

507
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:38,759
with this kid for like almost a year

508
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,200
is autistic high on the spectrum it was

509
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,329
the sweetest boy I've ever met the

510
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:45,149
reason that he kept acting on classroom

511
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:46,950
was because he his teacher kept putting

512
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:49,290
him down and didn't believe in him his

513
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:52,230
parents didn't want to accept him so he

514
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:53,730
had a lot of anger built up so I think

515
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:56,369
one of the things is definitely is

516
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,530
getting outside the bubble we tend to

517
00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:00,420
find more about other people but we also

518
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,339
start accepting and trying to understand

519
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,500
other people with empathy and I think

520
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:06,569
that's the key right there is actually

521
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:10,940
empathy itself not compassion but

522
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:14,150
empathy any other questions

00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:09,750
yeah all right let me try to break you

529
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:11,310
down three things okay one the lack of

530
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,990
confidence is something that's actually

531
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:15,569
been programmed in most people that are

532
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:17,459
minorities and also and women as well

533
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:20,640
for example when it comes to sending

534
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,440
resumes for a white male they'll be like

535
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,078
sixty percent might be like oh yeah I

536
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,569
have that I meet all that criteria 60

537
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,300
percent of that criteria that is and I'm

538
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:31,349
gonna apply women we have to do over 110

539
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,359
percent and that's the same for

540
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:36,000
minorities is because there's this lack

541
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,740
of confidence because I think it has a

542
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,599
lot to do with Society I think it has a

543
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:42,779
lot to do with maybe you know seeing in

544
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,150
movies for example you know not seeing

545
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,710
someone who looks like you being able to

546
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:49,140
achieve something is something that

547
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,619
really holds one back but it also makes

548
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,999
them

549
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:56,220
about the possibilities I think of all

550
00:36:53,999 --> 00:36:59,759
the times where I hear about women that

551
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:02,730
are trying to start a company and I see

552
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:05,609
them and I know that only 2% are going

553
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:08,249
to be funded and I just look at them and

554
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:10,499
I was I'm worried because the thing is

555
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:12,990
at the end of the day is that they

556
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:15,720
they're still pushing they're giving

557
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:17,308
more than anything possible and they're

558
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,368
working their butt off and then they

559
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:23,180
don't get funds at all because of their

560
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:25,710
own gender and I see that even with

561
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:27,690
minorities some will actually sit in the

562
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,119
back of the classroom instead being in

563
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:33,119
the front of the classroom and I think

564
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,519
that's because you know the lack of

565
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,829
conscience because we don't meet

566
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,729
criteria that society has placed on us

567
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:40,730
since a very young age

571
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,890
define this part of you that believes

572
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,920
that you're worth something and if you

573
00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:00,740
feel like you're not worth something try

574
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,050
to find out why that is he's gonna think

575
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:05,839
at the end of the day is that when we

576
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:08,740
start doing like we're not worthy of

577
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:11,180
something I feel like that's a challenge

578
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,399
look at as a challenge where you're like

579
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:15,109
start remembering everyone who says you

580
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,420
can't do this you can't do that

581
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:19,760
think of all the stereotypes I saw here

582
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,440
the biases though placed on you and use

583
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,160
that as a fuel to be like you know what

584
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,200
fine I'm gonna prove you wrong and by

585
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,810
prove you wrong I mean you're proving to

586
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,910
yourself you're worthy at that point and

587
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:35,000
I feel like that's where the start

588
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:36,470
starts it has to happen within you and

589
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,820
unfortunately we cannot change other

590
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,770
people's opinions and thoughts

591
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,720
especially if it's very much ingrained

592
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:43,720
but at least we could share stories

[Music]

594
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:12,930
like equal like you know the love are

595
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:18,410
equal like men and women then when I go

596
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:18,410
to RSA and look at that like oh my god

597
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,240
and then you're like okay please see my

598
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,800
assistance please say not assistance

599
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,020
ends up with them being assistance

600
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,050
you're like oh man but at least there's

601
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:35,880
no line for the bathroom and that's a

602
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:38,099
good thing in some ways but honestly it

603
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,069
it's unfortunate but you are right

604
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:42,990
there's a shortage of protein and it's

605
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:45,180
giving people are gonna push in now at

606
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:51,149
this point you can't say you know

607
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:56,240
anymore I'm any other questions all

608
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,240
right well thank you oh wait

609
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:10,670
okay why it didn't hit me that that's

610
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,740
what I was dealing with because I was

611
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:16,130
not proper for last time that suddenly

612
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:18,049
went to cybersecurity I'm here and then

613
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,760
what happened was when I went to RSA and

614
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:24,020
I started seeing like there was no women

615
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:26,180
here and now all white men Leon St I

616
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,130
remember going back to the hotel room

617
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:31,430
which stretch the bathroom like why do I

618
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:33,140
feel like there's something wrong like I

619
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,089
just don't feel right and then I just

620
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,960
broke down crying and I think that's

621
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:40,190
when it hit me something's wrong here I

622
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,440
literally like I just thought there's

623
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:45,080
like and that was it the tipping point

624
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,910
was that was like in April right two

625
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,680
months go in and that's Lilly I start

626
00:41:46,910 --> 00:42:01,310
thinking like I want to leave this space

627
00:41:48,680 --> 00:42:04,100
because I but something changed me where

628
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:06,620
I just kind of got to a point where some

629
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:10,089
life things happen and I was like I got

630
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:13,910
proved to myself I'm worthy of something

631
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:16,040
so I submitted a talk and it was

632
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:18,950
accepted and my voice is cracking

633
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,690
because they have got over a flu I'm not

634
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,490
crying

635
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:25,190
but yeah Sarah that was that was my

636
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:27,740
tipping point was that moment was that

637
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,320
somehow he had to prove to myself that

638
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,990
I'm worthy of something and then I just

639
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,240
kept going forward and every time I felt

640
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:38,419
like I needed to take a step back or

641
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:41,180
anything like that I would just throw my

642
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:44,630
throw myself even harder and keep going

643
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,740
against the current and now I'm very

644
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,710
fortunate is that I built

645
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:52,109
number because I kept kosher things and

646
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:55,350
that Network has been supporting me more

647
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:58,410
than ever before and I help them too but

648
00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:01,130
most importantly it's helped me grow and

649
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,990
it's also given them the ability to see

650
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:06,090
you know these issues that are around

651
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:08,879
the area because it is men and women

652
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:30,240
that are champions for women and for

653
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:32,040
minorities as well so thank you guys you

654
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,470
