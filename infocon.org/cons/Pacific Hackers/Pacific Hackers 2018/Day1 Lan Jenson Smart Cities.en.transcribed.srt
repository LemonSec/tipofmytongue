1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
initiative on the smart cities that I

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,859
think is incredibly interesting and

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,319
important and that's the reason why

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:20,970
lighter her to come and speak to us

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:49,890
today she does have an initiative which

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:53,239
is going to speed up first of all thank

7
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:58,649
you so much rod for inviting me to speak

8
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:02,459
and secondly if someone while I speak

9
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:08,640
maybe can help me bring this out on my

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:13,260
screen okay there's a switch just toggle

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,140
oh so this is showing toggle yeah

12
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:22,610
target to my other oh maybe this way I

13
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,610
think I mean oh oh oh there we go

14
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:46,409
nope you know there is a toggle for oh

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:53,130
that's where we are okay I could then I

16
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:56,689
think he faked it my cursor back do you

17
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,689
see it coming back

18
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:11,740
you I just needed to point it to that

19
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:22,810
smartest secure cities now Jesus lies

20
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:27,190
file oh yeah you got it is that G yeah G

21
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:40,209
sly so maybe up a little bit up a little

22
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:43,030
bit yeah oh yeah I've so Wow yeah thank

23
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:47,200
you for helping me out on this and I

24
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:49,470
have a lot of files and images some of

25
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,290
them were taken from the recent time

26
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:57,610
keynote

27
00:02:52,290 --> 00:03:09,100
it's called smart secure cities now yeah

28
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:15,459
cheese lies yes all right

29
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:18,820
and so yeah here I'm reusing this set of

30
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:23,280
slides because I think this is the

31
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:27,910
perfect audience and I don't mean to

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,150
compete with the Emery's a call to

33
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:33,340
action earlier but maybe this is another

34
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,450
way that we are actually very very well

35
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,110
aligned

36
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:41,890
you're not the people here and in this

37
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:46,180
group are very precious I think we both

38
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:50,589
recognize that and what I'm here to talk

39
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:55,060
about is that there is a large heart for

40
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:57,720
a large stage under the initiative led

41
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:02,010
by NIST and homeland security department

42
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:06,370
for smart secure cities for everyone

43
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:10,720
here to put your talents and passion to

44
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:13,150
work so what I mean by that let me take

45
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,950
you through this a little bit

46
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,418
and before I do that let me give a

47
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:22,360
little bit intro of myself so hey I like

48
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:26,280
to call myself a cyber double 7 turn to

49
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,560
M this is why the cyber double 7 part

50
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:34,239
that's because I have tracked down

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:37,270
hackers who for one example who created

52
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,790
millions of online accounts at the

53
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,280
financial institutions at that time I

54
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,919
just did this is happened a long time

55
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,150
ago so I could name the names Charles

56
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:52,900
Schwab and so that hacker had defrauded

57
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:55,570
Google and Facebook and many others and

58
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,870
then when he came to her house web

59
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:03,490
because what he met the right matches so

60
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,590
myself and my team was we were not able

61
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,889
to stop him

62
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:11,650
but we also talked him down because he

63
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:15,850
had to do some reconnaissance and he

64
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:19,409
left some trails and at our firm and so

65
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:22,090
we eventually tracked him down and

66
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,960
foiled his plan to make millions of

67
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,859
dollars through the new account rich you

68
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:32,530
know Lincoln and collecting their

69
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:37,060
tae-young what do you call it the money

70
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:40,900
link rate is two thumbs with a total of

71
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,630
under $1 to prove that you know your new

72
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,719
account here is linked with your new

73
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,909
account in another financial institution

74
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,610
so that was took us a bit of time

75
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:57,729
several days to figure that out but we

76
00:05:51,610 --> 00:06:01,599
did and we were able to hell with the

77
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:04,840
trails that we have built up FBI and

78
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:09,340
Secret Service both raised to to the

79
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,948
house to arrest the person so so that's

80
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,619
why I'm like ok I think I can call us

81
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:18,220
out of that in their trenches for about

82
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:22,210
10 years and that turn and part is

83
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:26,630
because guess what I realized that it's

84
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:29,479
like whack the ball game you spell

85
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:32,060
millions of dollars our good people side

86
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,580
you address a one guy who actually spent

87
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,860
I only know a couple of hours not even

88
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,380
much money right they can buy those

89
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,980
tools so easily now online

90
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,920
so he's not a ficient an effective game

91
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,860
so I started to do more of the

92
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,930
management side awareness training some

93
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:55,400
security programs some of security

94
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:58,790
strategies all of that and then the

95
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,510
other end part is that I became a mother

96
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:05,900
so start you think about my youngsters

97
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:08,240
information security and privacy so also

98
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,060
by then I moved to Cisco for a couple of

99
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,830
years and the answer started growing I'm

100
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:17,710
like oh thank and you know it's not a

101
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:21,109
waiting for me so a switched gears and

102
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:24,320
establish a nonprofit called adaptable

103
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:28,150
security so you all know at the a

104
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:30,830
probable that is the ultimate estate any

105
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,950
business can get you you there's no

106
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,469
absolute security the best we can do is

107
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:39,140
to stay one step ahead of the hackers

108
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:42,620
and that's the most most efficient

109
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:46,760
cost-effective way as well so long story

110
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:51,110
short and then and this about earlier

111
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:54,159
this year in March I started volunteer

112
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:58,100
with this global city teams challenge

113
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,980
which was led by NIST and Homeland

114
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,140
Security Department so together they

115
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,540
have the smartest secure cities and

116
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:09,229
communities challenge and so they were

117
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,480
like oh lamb you are what we need we

118
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:15,500
have been trying to get this security

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:18,410
side go in for smart cities but we

120
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,830
haven't seen much effect so come on

121
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:24,350
board become the co-chair along with the

122
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,599
Homeland Security Department deputy

123
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,930
director Scott so he's the other

124
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,050
co-chair so together we are oh my

125
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,049
apologies

126
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,779
Oh

127
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:13,719
yeah I double-clicked maybe the

128
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,720
precision is not there

129
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:36,430
oh so now you just selected I see

130
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,720
thank you

131
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:08,530
all right so let me then continue on

132
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:13,920
okay to the the first one this is by the

133
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:17,020
way the key note that I gave at a recent

134
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,349
conference that NIST and the Homeland

135
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:23,740
Security jointly hosted at NIST

136
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,260
headquarters so smart city says we know

137
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,660
a lot of cities are trying to do it

138
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,090
right so easy here to stay

139
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:34,810
we don't need to go into the benefits of

140
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:37,150
it so I'm just going to keep on going

141
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,900
into the next one and secure cities as

142
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:46,170
we know not quite there we all have

143
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:50,590
heard about the Atlantic City incident

144
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:52,780
and so also by the way and I'm totally

145
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,180
open to answering questions along the

146
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:59,140
way so you don't have to save it at your

147
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:03,010
the end and there historically this is

148
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:07,060
where we have come in the past 30 years

149
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:10,930
or so the graphically shows the past 10

150
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:15,010
years or so but guess what is not doing

151
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:17,670
really well and some ways say hey we

152
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:22,210
haven't spent enough money on this issue

153
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:25,120
guess what we have the budget in terms

154
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:32,820
of the gtp has been consistently

155
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:37,000
climbing mm-hmm so what do we do next

156
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,740
some optimistic people among us say

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,110
there's got to be something we can do

158
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,140
right there is you know we have sent

159
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:49,780
people to the moon this we surely can

160
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:53,380
handle and so can we throw more money in

161
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:56,079
it as a matter of fact that's not going

162
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,300
to address this as this some smart

163
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,610
people have down through the edge in

164
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,760
this research you have seen so it's

165
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,950
Erick insurance company and the ethnic

166
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,920
counsel they do this research together

167
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,140
there is going to be a point when the

168
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,689
cost from

169
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:17,370
cybersecurity data breaches and privacy

170
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:21,000
breaches and will echo the benefits from

171
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:27,060
the internet communications information

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:33,030
technologies so what do we do and not to

173
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:35,699
power it on the hacker the incidents due

174
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:40,589
to hacker intentional hacking actually

175
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:43,910
has been rising way faster or pretty

176
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:48,180
much the more more of the rage now and

177
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:50,579
then now another thing that everyone has

178
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,790
been talking about the Internet of

179
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,040
Things smart cities of course IOT is the

180
00:12:53,790 --> 00:13:00,390
only a part of the smart cities but it's

181
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:03,719
going to be raising the scale to at

182
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:07,380
least the five times more attacks

183
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,810
service than before so that also not

184
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,050
just the device amount of devices right

185
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:15,140
you know we also because of the people

186
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:18,630
so traditionally you know large

187
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,850
enterprises and municipalities etc the

188
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:24,660
the people as FISA were trained better

189
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:28,730
now with all the consumers joining the

190
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:33,719
attack surface so is anyone's bet and

191
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:36,240
here is some hacking incidents as

192
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,150
examples the first one everyone knows

193
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,550
about me right in the free the the

194
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:46,410
frightening part is that the compromised

195
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:51,449
the only takes out of two minutes is

196
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:56,670
that fast and the example of it shows

197
00:13:51,450 --> 00:14:01,290
that oh initially because of it being so

198
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:04,050
potent and damaging some experts said oh

199
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:06,689
there's gotta be nation-states behind

200
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:11,189
this right if famous was his name

201
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:14,340
Schneider he said ha man at the end it

202
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:17,370
turned out is three college students not

203
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:23,570
even graduated so what does that tell us

204
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:27,050
the devious mind could

205
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:30,760
anywhere as long as someone wants to go

206
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:34,660
there with the right set of skills

207
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:38,630
having anywhere by I mean among any

208
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,550
population is the that is the scary part

209
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,460
and of course now they have released

210
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:48,770
their the basically code into the wild

211
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:52,370
so that basically makes it that much

212
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,180
harder and the second example is the

213
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,810
fish tank

214
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:59,239
smart fish tank so that the example in

215
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,699
in Las Vegas right like example

216
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,090
showcases that and it can having the

217
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:09,860
least expected places so now that's what

218
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:14,180
we were facing and then to top that's

219
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:17,750
what the smart cities are happening in

220
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:23,500
this kind of environment and that all by

221
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:28,280
the way is why the young CIOs and the CI

222
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:30,680
SOC souls are so scared off right now so

223
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,730
when I was trying to when I was helping

224
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:37,849
one of the anecdote right I was just

225
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:40,670
helping a major municipality in the Bay

226
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,900
Area are hiring their first season its

227
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:47,150
chief information security officer and

228
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:49,730
the CIO first thing in the morning right

229
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:52,130
you know many candidates are lining up

230
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:55,460
the first thing we are just getting

231
00:15:52,130 --> 00:16:04,450
ready and say all tells me did you see

232
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:08,090
the city you did appreciate helping you

233
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:10,640
it just happened our purpose now is to

234
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:15,110
hire a person to help us to not show up

235
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:19,850
in the news like that so they actually

236
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:24,050
are very much a moderate very nervously

237
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:28,490
and very closely right so along with it

238
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:30,339
and so now because of the smarts secure

239
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:35,000
cities just have a little bit of plug in

240
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:37,100
many municipalities are aware of it and

241
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,480
they are tapping you too

242
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:46,580
this Nestor's DHS led initiative to get

243
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:49,460
our help so the stage is ready for

244
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:52,490
people who are passionate and I wanted

245
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,630
to do something I had to join in join

246
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:58,700
forces together all right

247
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:01,730
competitor the slice the thing the

248
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,940
thinking pattern here which is that okay

249
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:09,020
our lovely lady here said Oh

250
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:11,780
after examining the hacking examples and

251
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:16,430
trends et cetera I know the secret is

252
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:21,260
adoption right if everyone the consumers

253
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:25,100
can adopt our all solutions the camera

254
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:28,010
makers can adopt the solutions and the

255
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:31,669
casinos as the organizations that uses

256
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:36,950
smart technologies gang adopt our

257
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:41,470
solutions then problem solved but nice

258
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:44,750
observation the thing is that this our

259
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,830
solution providers industries happy

260
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,470
trying that

261
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:51,770
right spending a lot of money our say

262
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:58,250
conference so many people go home but

263
00:17:51,770 --> 00:18:01,760
the adoption among the key population

264
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,360
it's still not quite there they don't go

265
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,780
to our sales so what do we do

266
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:13,850
so this dialogue continues on it goes

267
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:17,450
that incentives and consequences need to

268
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,679
be in place to encourage adoption take

269
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,340
one simple example

270
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:26,920
Equifax after their humungous data

271
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:30,379
breach happened the stock price dropped

272
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:35,630
by how much I think at one point is by

273
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:38,060
30 percent but then unfortunately number

274
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:42,830
one is opposed to the data breach not

275
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:46,550
right not no transparency for people to

276
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:49,580
have a voice and number two after a

277
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,899
couple of months stock price goes back

278
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,370
that is

279
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:58,240
and some transparency needs to happen to

280
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:01,659
allow the key members especially our

281
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,600
communities of the people with the power

282
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:08,410
to actually have the voice be heard by

283
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:13,850
the people who are dying to have such

284
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:18,050
knowledge right so this is just a quick

285
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:20,689
layout of the sectors in a society so we

286
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:23,178
all want to have that large businesses

287
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,660
wanted options especially the solution

288
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:29,809
providers and people want adoption but

289
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:33,350
they don't know they don't know what

290
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:36,470
like one after target data breach one

291
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,790
lady said oh I'm never going to go back

292
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,450
to target again

293
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:44,809
she was defrauded right and I was like

294
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:49,460
lady good luck where else are you going

295
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:53,510
to go you don't know which business

296
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:56,990
offers her better protection right so I

297
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:59,960
think that's where we the people who

298
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:03,100
have been in the trenches who have the

299
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,720
skills and talent and passion have a

300
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,120
responsibility well I don't want to say

301
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:13,010
responsibility a heavy word but it's a

302
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:15,800
place where we can use our talent okay

303
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:18,860
and later I'll show you where the stage

304
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:23,090
is already set up for you to use the

305
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:25,340
talent the leaders already have seen

306
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,709
that as well that's why they set up

307
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,860
order they allowance to this initiative

308
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:35,840
called Smart secure cities and

309
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:41,719
communities challenge alright so the

310
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:44,809
largest depart SMB gov that sector as I

311
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,300
we just already touched on they are very

312
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:51,410
nervous they want to do something but

313
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:54,169
they face issues two bottlenecks one I

314
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:58,179
just came back from a CIO retreat and a

315
00:20:54,170 --> 00:21:04,760
C sees a retreat and they Washington

316
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:07,130
State military head oh let's say

317
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:12,260
remember exactly the title he said we

318
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:16,190
can't you know these million dollars

319
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:19,610
they they they can invest in the need

320
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:22,790
but we can't compete so this is where we

321
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:25,159
are at so afterwards I shared my

322
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,649
business card with him she's like oh yes

323
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,530
let's connect out please right so there

324
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:35,870
is that humongous need but the platform

325
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:40,670
until now it was not quite there so then

326
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:45,550
let's continue on with also the larger

327
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:49,010
businesses they also have a need because

328
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:52,730
they continuously share spend a lot of

329
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:55,550
money for conferences like I say but the

330
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:58,370
key demographic is they're not present

331
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,620
they don't go there right so earlier I

332
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,870
showed that number ninety-nine point

333
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:06,199
seven percent and fifty percent because

334
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:09,530
what they are ninety nine point five

335
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,170
percent of the businesses are small and

336
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:14,840
medium-sized businesses in the American

337
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:17,780
Society that's why they are the backbone

338
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,560
of the economy now in terms of the

339
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:25,480
people employed by this sector they are

340
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:28,490
nearly 50% of the people now if you add

341
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:33,410
government employees the odd number is

342
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:35,690
much higher than 50 percent so I I got

343
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:39,490
lazy I do not you know add the numbers

344
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:44,330
into here but that gives you the picture

345
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:48,530
ray so everyone has a need now is the

346
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:53,949
platform we can give each other what we

347
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:58,100
need and then also get what we want and

348
00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:00,590
that's the smart Sakura cities and that

349
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,469
cyber security and privacy Advisory

350
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:08,530
Committee CPAC that's the committee that

351
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:10,850
I co-chair with the DHS deputy director

352
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:14,840
right so now everyone gets what they

353
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:17,899
want in the people when deliverable from

354
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,560
this includes a platform that can give

355
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,560
the transparent

356
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:28,710
and of course it also gives the hackers

357
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:34,250
the white hat hackers the voice the

358
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:34,250
platform to share their talent as well

359
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,530
all right and so as MBG side of course

360
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:44,250
they will get good help

361
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:47,850
so this good help can come in the pro

362
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:50,640
bono projects or paid projects so here

363
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:52,709
I'll just share that we already have

364
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,650
some municipalities who have such a

365
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,570
project so we're talking and then so

366
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,060
there are pro bono projects

367
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,669
opportunities for people who wanted to

368
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:05,580
gain real-life experience and then

369
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:08,750
they're also paying in project roles who

370
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:13,470
for people who already have done it and

371
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:16,770
why don't you have a side gig right and

372
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:21,450
so in this side gig you can also mentor

373
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:26,450
other less experienced folks so by doing

374
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:31,560
this way we raise the availability of

375
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:34,190
people like yourselves all right so it

376
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,780
doesn't work this will you know PV

377
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:40,140
public/private partnership does it work

378
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:45,710
so it actually works I hear I just have

379
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:50,150
a quick example to show that in early

380
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:54,600
October we had a event that some of the

381
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:59,240
talented people here went to so for a

382
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:02,520
first year event we had many larger

383
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,770
private businesses who also share our

384
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,860
vision who came through to sponsor and

385
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:10,550
we have a lot of the professionals from

386
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:16,530
all of this professional organizations

387
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:20,370
present we have the smoke and medium

388
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:20,970
businesses and governments present at

389
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:26,100
that

390
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:30,690
so that symposium happened with all of

391
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:32,490
these people who by the way dude some of

392
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:37,100
them are first-time goers to a

393
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:39,090
cybersecurity event altogether right and

394
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,389
what is the result

395
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:45,959
did people learn anything this came the

396
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:49,140
result from themselves so with three

397
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,559
additional sponsors wanted to help next

398
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:56,550
year and 95% of the people want this

399
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,129
event again hey one of the unsure people

400
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:01,139
is a friend of mine and he's going

401
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:07,170
through a career transition

402
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:10,320
so I excuse him for saying sure here and

403
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:14,010
then also the other side is that most of

404
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,399
the people 95% also said there are going

405
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:22,280
to put the learning into changing

406
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:28,980
behaviors that I think is really

407
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:32,280
promising positive outcome so now that's

408
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:34,950
one example of this public-private

409
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,200
partnership it really works

410
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,600
right and then besides that one thing

411
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:44,820
there are quite a few other things that

412
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:48,270
we have in the roadmap that we are also

413
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:50,340
working alright so before I go into

414
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:54,360
those milestones

415
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:58,620
let me also touch on how this March is

416
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:03,510
secure cities initiative work so so far

417
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:06,809
over 200 cities already globally already

418
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,590
participate in this initiative in under

419
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:11,790
this initiative

420
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:14,939
there are as so-called super clusters so

421
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:18,409
people in a certain sector they group

422
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:21,750
together and contribute their expertise

423
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:24,600
so we have agriculture Andrew raw data

424
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:27,179
super cluster Public Safety super

425
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,419
cluster transportation so smart

426
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:32,730
transportation and smart utility smart

427
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:37,260
wireless and smart education there's a

428
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:41,850
smart buildings that is being formed as

429
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:45,040
we speak now for all of these super

430
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:49,850
clusters we in a C pack

431
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:53,870
we'll provide support and help across

432
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:57,620
the board to them what doesn't mean we

433
00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:00,679
will we currently have members from

434
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:04,939
their leadership team to be on our board

435
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:07,730
and we assign one to two champions to

436
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,510
help them okay so there is a continuous

437
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:15,830
feedback mechanism so it's not top-heavy

438
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:18,260
so that the superclusters they in the

439
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:21,050
past they didn't want to adopt they felt

440
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,150
like any other companies felt that oh

441
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:25,340
you want me to implement securities

442
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:29,030
that's gonna slow me down I mean why

443
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:31,879
would I do that right so yeah now

444
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,879
because we are implementing this way we

445
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,370
are incentive for them to use our help

446
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:43,250
rather than feeling like they are

447
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:45,979
mandated and forced to do it so some of

448
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,530
the other milestones we have listed here

449
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:53,080
also will give them additional

450
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:57,649
incentives to come on board and this

451
00:28:53,080 --> 00:29:01,939
milestones are being delivered by our

452
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,070
CPAC members and our CPAC members

453
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,930
include just you and me

454
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:09,169
you know you feel hot you think you have

455
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:11,720
one to two hours a week to join in

456
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:15,020
contribute your expertise great that's

457
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,440
exactly for you okay and it could be

458
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:21,980
also for businesses that identify with

459
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,160
the vision and join in that will be even

460
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:29,360
better because with business support we

461
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:31,970
can scale that much faster right okay

462
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,659
let me with that let me just touch on

463
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:38,560
the mouth nose a little bit so you you

464
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:42,470
you know and then hopefully some of you

465
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:45,350
may decide that you're yourself or

466
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:48,820
someone you know could it be interested

467
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:53,659
and then refer them to this initiative

468
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:55,909
right so four big categories of

469
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,790
deliverables and milestones first of all

470
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:02,530
is a guidebook

471
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:05,020
this guidebook is going to be if I use

472
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,090
any analogy you you probably all have

473
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:10,440
heard about the NIST cybersecurity

474
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:13,840
framework right nest and see

475
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,090
cybersecurity and SF okay

476
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:23,409
and then some of you may have heard

477
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:25,689
about even the DHS cyber risk cyber

478
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,340
resilience review icky and then I can

479
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:30,910
get that right first time cyber

480
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:33,459
resilience review CRR which is a tool to

481
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:36,060
make the end the cybersecurity framework

482
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,740
more operational easier for

483
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:43,870
municipalities or anyone can to start

484
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:46,060
using it right so even with that it's

485
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:48,850
too hard right if you don't have a

486
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:52,540
professional on your team it's too hard

487
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:56,139
so I liken it to this those two things

488
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:59,680
are like the paper map if you want to go

489
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,330
to the place you circle out and encircle

490
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:06,370
the destination out and then you plot

491
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:09,879
out your your path together but now in

492
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:12,580
this day of age we see pack wanted a

493
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,050
once I shall not feel there's not a fit

494
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:20,250
all tool to help people it's like a ways

495
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:24,340
in comparison to the traditional map and

496
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:29,320
when I say in ways anyone who doesn't

497
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:32,050
know what it is ways or Maps Google Maps

498
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,409
etcetera right so you put in starting

499
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,379
point

500
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:38,860
you give it also the the destination

501
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:42,250
point then it will give you the optimum

502
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,120
in route based on real-time traffic

503
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,480
information

504
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,439
oh this route has an accident you should

505
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,270
not go there right

506
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,850
so the same way for a smaller business

507
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:56,920
organization if they don't capture a

508
00:31:54,850 --> 00:32:01,270
whole lot of data why do they have to

509
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:05,140
use the CRR right to to get more

510
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:07,840
compliant so this is how we're going to

511
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:11,320
make it work we provide a guidebook and

512
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,439
then to couple that with a

513
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:18,550
yeah based a tool to help the

514
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:21,520
organization's do there are security and

515
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:27,850
then this data based a tool we're also

516
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:28,600
going to use as little jargon as

517
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,610
possible

518
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,560
for example we were probably not even

519
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:34,889
going to use the word cybersecurity you

520
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:39,820
say they were gonna use trustworthy

521
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:43,270
right so that anyone can understand so

522
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:48,070
that is the idea a database tool so that

523
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:50,860
any organization can put some people to

524
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:54,120
take a fresh look and then get some idea

525
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:56,169
and now if they realize that oh shoot

526
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,169
this is beyond me

527
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:04,240
this is I don't know what to do sir is

528
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:08,740
about what risk then the next thing is

529
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,680
projects so CPAC also has team of

530
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:17,850
experts that's what we're talking about

531
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:23,830
you can also come in just go without it

532
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:28,719
can also assemble team to do a project

533
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:31,870
for them how handy is that right so we

534
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,350
anticipate that with this approach the

535
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:39,699
adoption will be that much faster we

536
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:41,669
already have several protein us for

537
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:46,210
example if an ad that nests the event

538
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:50,020
represented at one city plus seat

539
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:53,170
pleasant they have 4,800 people they're

540
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:56,530
like yeah please sign us up so now I

541
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:59,770
just need to have more people like

542
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:03,910
experts like you guys to join on board

543
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:05,500
and then let's do it for them right so

544
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,120
that's the project's the third one is

545
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,330
the symposiums

546
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,819
and webinars to continue their spreading

547
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:19,719
of the word so the symposium you saw one

548
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:21,940
example and then in February 22 22nd

549
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:25,000
there's going to be a much bigger scale

550
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:29,639
over 1,000 people

551
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:32,230
we all be gathering in Washington DC

552
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:38,020
yes let's go there

553
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:41,379
so DC yep and the best part is that the

554
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,860
booth space I was told get as many as

555
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:48,219
you want and for free

556
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:51,720
that's that that's how how determined

557
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:54,459
yes the central at the federal level the

558
00:34:51,719 --> 00:35:02,230
leaders want to get this message across

559
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:04,960
so I am now okay getting this word out

560
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:08,500
is through you guys so spread the word

561
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,960
as wide as you can and we will want to

562
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:17,860
see you right so that's the third one

563
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:22,330
the last box is about and see if I can

564
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:26,920
remember it is about transparency Oh

565
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:29,560
incentives and consequences right

566
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:33,250
we wanted to mobilize the entire society

567
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:36,580
because ultimately this is their right

568
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:39,520
and this is their privacy and financial

569
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:42,610
security and all on the line and they

570
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,480
want to have such information it's just

571
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,880
that right now

572
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,090
Yury as an industry have not provided

573
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:52,770
them we say the right language the right

574
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:57,600
tool to use yet so under this initiative

575
00:35:52,770 --> 00:36:05,500
we will do exactly that we will provide

576
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:08,650
a consortium to certify the smart to

577
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,200
certify secure cities so that those

578
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:15,370
smart cities have an incentive to become

579
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,100
secure in the mean time right so because

580
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:21,520
the the some people just a recently I

581
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:25,529
think today yesterday CN rq-4 I would he

582
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:28,450
more more comprehensive stricter IOT

583
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:32,380
regulations but you know what by

584
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:33,879
definition they're not very fast for any

585
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,490
regulation to come forward they are

586
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,800
gonna take time in the meantime what do

587
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:41,740
we do we can't be sitting ducks

588
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,150
right on the side so this is our chance

589
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:49,930
to actually put everything together and

590
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,830
there the public voice their power so

591
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:54,310
that's a while

592
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:56,980
Yussef another one is I call it a cyber

593
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:59,590
trust map you're the first one by the

594
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,030
way in the public group to hear this

595
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,640
because previously I do not even

596
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:07,930
announce that way at the nest conference

597
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:10,810
I wanted to build our team up a little

598
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:12,700
bit further before I announce but in our

599
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:15,520
you know Silicon Valley I feel like this

600
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,620
is our home so talking with the friends

601
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,330
so I think I feel like I can share that

602
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:26,109
with you what it does is to share with

603
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:29,350
the public that what product has what

604
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:31,960
kind of a security posture in a language

605
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:37,620
that they can understand right so for

606
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:41,470
example I know that this security camera

607
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:44,319
protects my secure privacy for example

608
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:47,169
and this is how they do it right and

609
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,410
then ask the public to raid it and we

610
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:54,160
also can have our own experts ratings

611
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:56,220
which our experts ratings will carry

612
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,049
more weight right because we know

613
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:02,859
because actually what you look for so

614
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:06,910
that being said we have all of its great

615
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:12,700
initiatives in the plan and the roadmap

616
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:16,270
is if out and the stage is established

617
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:18,910
from the grassroots level as well as the

618
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:22,630
municipality level and all the way up to

619
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:27,609
the federal level so the call for action

620
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:33,010
is out and I hope you guys are the

621
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:36,840
pioneers to join in that with that I

622
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,840
conclude my talk today

623
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:40,290
[Applause]

624
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,720
thank you
