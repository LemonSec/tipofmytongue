1
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,090
welcome everyone

2
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,490
so I'm gonna talk about the crux of

3
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,930
their cloud threat landscape so in this

4
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,880
talk we primarily gonna look at the

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,460
enterprise cloud apps and we go for

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,140
different attack surfaces have use cases

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,930
and stuff like that so this talk is

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,149
primarily based on the research we have

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,769
done for the last two years and come up

10
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,329
with different scenarios and stuff like

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,270
that or you can exploit the cloud apps

12
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,860
and things like that but first of all

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,870
welcome everyone and thanks for

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,700
attending this talk and hopefully for

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,070
the next 40 45 minutes we'll make it a

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,670
really good journey so just a little bit

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,640
back reflagged out of mine for a couple

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,609
of years now dropped at this book which

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,970
also got picked up by Chinese as well as

20
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:09,180
this translate into Chinese as well but

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,130
anyhow from afar there are only a little

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,119
disclaimer in the contacts like whatever

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,710
the research we're going to talk about

24
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,830
isn't really anything too specific

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,780
employer or anyone and the reason for

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,460
that is just just because for we're

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,200
sharing the research with the community

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,390
and we're gonna make sure that people

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,220
understand for educational purposes and

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,840
everything you know you have some

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,240
caution down the lane you know it's a

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,829
learning aspect but it's more about

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,809
what's happening in the world of the

34
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,770
cloud apps so that is where we are going

35
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,360
after during this talk so look into the

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,548
tracks into the cloud application space

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,799
so if you look at these tag lines and

38
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,450
all that you know news articles it talks

39
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,159
about you know what the problems that we

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,890
are facing in the context of our

41
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,259
applications when I see cloud apps I'm

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,750
referring to Bob's Dropbox Google Drive

43
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:59,310
Amazon and similar set of cloud apps

44
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,799
mostly that Kapadia enterprises as all

45
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,119
and the individuals are also using it so

46
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,369
if you look at all these you know tag

47
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,039
lines you can barely see you know it has

48
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,179
been covered in the media several

49
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,189
exploit cases you know

50
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:16,950
attack surfaces remove around these

51
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:18,328
flower apps as well so when we stand so

52
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,670
there are many cloud apps out there

53
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:22,049
which are susceptible to abuse when I'm

54
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,488
saying abuse like couple of the

55
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:26,069
functionalities and these cloud

56
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:28,920
applications provide those can be abused

57
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,629
as well further there are exploits

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,399
available which means that in if you

59
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,950
find vulnerabilities in those cloud apps

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,680
you can also use to launch different set

61
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,000
of attacks but in reality it is

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,120
happening isn't it

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,430
let's take a look so if look at this you

64
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,250
know statistical analysis it was one of

65
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,590
produced by God earlier so we the

66
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:54,359
bringing of the year by year like 2016

67
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:56,939
1780 2019 2020 I mean this is

68
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:59,129
explanation right take your cloud apps

69
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:59,970
are going at exponential rate and which

70
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,679
is true as well

71
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,409
right because nobody's like trying to

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,819
down there you know hardest like you

73
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,679
know other stuff everybody's like

74
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,119
pushing the data to the cloud all the

75
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,340
vendors are coming with the scenario

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,260
with like you know indirect when you're

77
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,000
forcing you to actually just go and

78
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,548
upload your data into the cloud itself

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,620
their process cost associated with that

80
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:21,599
but again we are living in the world of

81
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,310
cloud these days and it is still going

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,649
to grow for next couple of years before

83
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,230
we come up with new set of technologies

84
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,030
but let's take a look so this actually

85
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,768
shows that you know what kind of for in

86
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,949
a cloud applications one or the other

87
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,709
way we are you know looking into it you

88
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:40,889
know office 365 look at the Microsoft is

89
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,049
exploding in atmosphere you know Google

90
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,579
Drive Dropbox whether we are building

91
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,919
you know infrastructure as a service

92
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:48,479
platform as platform as a service

93
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,459
classroom or software as a service

94
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,329
everywhere it cloud is playing a

95
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,150
significant role

96
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:58,319
but for us we attack that in all the

97
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,479
application space in this talk but if

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,458
you look at this fear this is real one

99
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,229
or the other way your end devices are

100
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,060
connecting to the cloud apps data is

101
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,220
moving from one place to the another

102
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,220
whooping hopping on a different channels

103
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,049
and that's where we are and that's where

104
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,510
the world is going through but the

105
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,940
caution here is that if the devices are

106
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,690
getting exponential

107
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,940
you know triggered up and all that at

108
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,100
the end of the day we are talking about

109
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,990
billions of devices right and which

110
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,380
means that attack surfaces are going to

111
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,570
increase an exponential rate as well and

112
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,310
for us as an researchers we need to

113
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,050
understand how the attackers are going

114
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,870
to abuse this platforms as well and

115
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,480
we'll take a look at doing now let's

116
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,490
just move forward and I'm gonna talk a

117
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,160
little bit about the threat that actors

118
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,990
try to actually you know present a

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,430
platform where we gonna talk about you

120
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,290
know how different that threat actors

121
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,780
can go ahead and abuse the cloud apps

122
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,460
different set of things right so we

123
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,739
talked about you know Aaron es employs

124
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,599
people making mistakes example will be

125
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,490
you know broadly sharing the files to

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,440
someone which is not even entitled to do

127
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,420
all your administrators are not putting

128
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,150
self controls and enterprises where this

129
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,130
just go after okay this file if shared

130
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,409
will be shared among all their employees

131
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,630
of the organization that is happening

132
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,400
malicious insider you know when are

133
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,380
disgruntled employee can do anything you

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,969
know access it download the files from

135
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,370
the cloud apps you know deleting files

136
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,080
and stuff like that but more importantly

137
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,700
attacker which is not inside the

138
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,070
organization but sitting somewhere

139
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,550
remote and then they are actually going

140
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:35,030
after the enterprises or organizations

141
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,700
by attacking cloud applications so we're

142
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,130
talking in detail a bit about it and

143
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,890
which will highlight what it is all

144
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,630
about let's take a look into the cloud

145
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,190
abnegation threats and attacks when I

146
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,409
say threats and attacks

147
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,690
we're gonna use some set of taxonomy

148
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,540
where we gonna talk about different set

149
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,710
of attacks in that context and

150
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,240
understanding the taxonomy is very very

151
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,729
much important to actually tie the

152
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,020
attacks together and then actually gives

153
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,630
us the broader view

154
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,280
why this happened how this happened and

155
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,460
what is the solution to go ahead with it

156
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,409
let's take a look so basically as a part

157
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,140
of the targeted cyber attacks face we

158
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:15,110
categorize into those into four basic

159
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,060
blocks right anything that has to be

160
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,130
exploited things like that there is some

161
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,390
infection needs to be triggered which

162
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,159
means that either you have to compromise

163
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,930
the device all you have to compromise

164
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,760
certain kind of things in the general

165
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,289
sense but when it comes back to the

166
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,400
cloud applications you need to make sure

167
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:32,830
how you are going to in fact and use

168
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,049
by using cloud apps as a launch pads

169
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:37,539
we'll talk about it more detail is

170
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,360
immuno examples and demonstrations as

171
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,160
well from infection we go to come on and

172
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,780
control which basically once you get

173
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,510
exploited you know how it's going to be

174
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,150
managed the cloud applications which are

175
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,310
compromised or user accounts on them

176
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,020
lateral spreading which means that you

177
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,750
know can you use again as the cloud as a

178
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,460
launch pad to distribute different set

179
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,220
of you know malicious documents on the

180
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,349
fly and directs filtration I want your

181
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,850
data so this is the kind of basic

182
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,980
taxonomy we're gonna use and we'll

183
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,470
dissect one by one with different set of

184
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,880
attacks targeted specifically on the

185
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:16,090
cloud applications and that's the way it

186
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,270
is so let's take a look into what we're

187
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,070
gonna cover today and since we are you

188
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,620
know entirely relating this talk

189
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,540
primarily on the application sphere

190
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,010
I won't go much detail into the

191
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,570
man-in-the-browser man and the cloud

192
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,200
attacks but we still touch on those

193
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:34,750
topics to cover the broadest fear so

194
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,690
very talk about in factions one of the

195
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,580
you know advanced attack that comes to

196
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,830
place drive-by download attacks why

197
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,359
what it means that you know you got a

198
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,010
phishing email somebody is forcing you

199
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,620
to click a link it will go somewhere

200
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,099
it's in the browser vulnerability gets

201
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,290
exploited payload is downloaded and then

202
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,190
the attack happens and the compromise is

203
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,320
there but we need to understand what are

204
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,180
the different variations of this attack

205
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,370
that can be triggered while the cloud

206
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,560
apps will take a deep dive into it come

207
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,910
on and control how can you use the

208
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,530
functionalities of certain cloud

209
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,660
applications to actually build the

210
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,489
command and control channel then there's

211
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,110
add our actual tradition cover love use

212
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,090
cases studies that we have gone through

213
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,560
we found we worked with the vendors

214
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,130
making sure those guys actually

215
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,890
eradicate those scenarios we'll talk

216
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:26,020
about some real-world case studies there

217
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,870
then cloud apps vulnerabilities inherent

218
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,780
in secure coding practices that actually

219
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:36,340
2d compromised one or the other way so

220
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:38,199
let's get it started so first we'll

221
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,300
start with you know little setup a base

222
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,690
with the dry by variants the very first

223
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,650
one we categorize is direct malware

224
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,080
distribute

225
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,390
but there are three variants we'll go

226
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,520
one by one and I'll show you how from

227
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,230
the basic be advanced attack can happen

228
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,500
and then we'll have a demonstration to

229
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:58,270
show you how it works so we talked about

230
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,580
direct malware distribution relay

231
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,990
attacks and incline drive-by download

232
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,240
let's first start with the direct

233
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,040
malware XY distribution several of the

234
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,630
cloud applications they claim they have

235
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,060
a built in you know antivirus protection

236
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,790
in place they can still scan for the

237
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,160
files but some of the camouflaging

238
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,329
techniques you can also use to bypass

239
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,800
that scenarios and which is possible and

240
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,260
what you can show you some examples on

241
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,640
that front as well so let's take a look

242
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,410
let's just understand the drive-by

243
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:32,410
download attack to actually set up the

244
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:33,819
base line from wool you know you know

245
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,040
you got a phishing email in the form of

246
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,990
Gmail or some another email you know

247
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,730
there's a link associated with it it is

248
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,100
taking you to these some cloud app let's

249
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,700
say Google Drive let's say you know Bob

250
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,380
straw Bob's anywhere in the file link to

251
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,910
is a kind of PowerPoint file or any

252
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:53,350
office file right somehow at that level

253
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,790
you know when that is triggered I'll you

254
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,430
redirect you to a certain set of file

255
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,709
I'm not sure if you've seen that earlier

256
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,569
but take for example of the Dropbox

257
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:05,320
right Dropbox has this kind of binary

258
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,800
check implemented like you know 0 or 1

259
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,350
right

260
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,880
so what it means that either can ask you

261
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,090
whether you want to download a file or

262
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,620
by changing the flag from 0 to 1 you can

263
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,020
automatically download the file on the

264
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,930
system other cloud applications doesn't

265
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,640
allow to actually go after and render

266
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,010
these files directly in the browser so

267
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,380
what they say ok download the file then

268
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,750
execute it on your system which is fine

269
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,370
as well but what happened in that case

270
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,810
when you don't have a visibility there

271
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,430
you're not able to actually render the

272
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,829
file in the browser one or the other way

273
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,839
well it's a plug-in or an add-on then

274
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,820
you actually download the file once it

275
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,070
is downloaded it automatically says auto

276
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:45,190
run functionality triggers and then you

277
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,540
got in fact it one or the other way but

278
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,220
in this case the only thing that you

279
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,530
have done is just click the link right

280
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,720
everything else is just forward

281
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:56,350
mechanism that was triggered and one

282
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,980
thing released to the another now

283
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,810
because we're talking about

284
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,140
I think the beauty of the system plays

285
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:05,959
here is what needs to be happened there

286
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,180
as a part of the security mechanism when

287
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,070
the file was hosted on the server or

288
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,380
downloaded from the cloud apps and

289
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,300
things like that but that is the basic

290
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,670
dry buy download attack we'll go into

291
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,839
the variations of this so very first

292
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,819
thing is that you know you can host

293
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,740
malware directly on the cloud

294
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,300
applications you know when I say

295
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,010
camouflaging which I mean so that you

296
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,490
have an executable file you change the

297
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:30,740
extension right through jpg or any kind

298
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,210
of image file is still there the caution

299
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,460
is that whether the cloud apps are

300
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,380
actually as an example whether actually

301
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,970
scanning it appropriately or they are

302
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,070
just saying after okay I check the

303
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,790
extension oh gee it's a jpg file I'm

304
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,670
done

305
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,260
you can stay size limits right most of

306
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,120
the malware that has been distributed in

307
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,189
the world right they are you know

308
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,110
shorter in size because they want to

309
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,120
make sure that the payload is restricted

310
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:57,500
constrained and then it can be easily

311
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,990
sent where your packets wiht TB traffic

312
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,170
and all that let's just take a look at

313
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,790
couple of examples and things like that

314
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,170
some of the functionalities that we want

315
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,849
to really look into when we're doing

316
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,160
some threat analysis around cloud apps

317
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,720
is that how the URL is sheared right how

318
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,000
it is generated whether they have some

319
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,570
kind of binary checks implemented where

320
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,700
the user doesn't have to actually click

321
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,950
on certain things on the cloud app but

322
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,390
by default that file gets downloaded on

323
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,810
to your system so all these things

324
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,939
really help attackers to lower down the

325
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:32,270
attack surface so if you're looking in

326
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,010
this particular example you know as I

327
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,810
mentioned you the binary check you can

328
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:39,140
clearly see there is a drop box one

329
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,449
white and then from there onwards it

330
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,910
comes is once you actually change the

331
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,490
flag from zero to one you can clearly

332
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,439
download the file without interaction so

333
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,060
which means that just click it if Sun

334
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,880
again get downloaded to your system

335
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,699
without providing any kind of you know

336
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,230
notification on the Dropbox itself

337
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,090
so maybe it's a part of the

338
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:03,110
functionality but it can be abused in

339
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:04,880
one or the other way so what that attack

340
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,590
wasn't chained to it it was actually

341
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,600
spreading the pressure and sameer at

342
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:11,300
that point of time right it was on the

343
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,810
Dropbox and then once it get downloaded

344
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,670
automatic

345
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,949
in the system your system gets infected

346
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,500
again the important part is that you can

347
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,750
claim that okay the end user system is

348
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,390
infected but the most important part in

349
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,610
that context is the attack is routed by

350
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,990
a clowder so what cloud our vendors are

351
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,640
doing what kind of security solutions

352
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,140
you need to be there to actually

353
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,300
circumvent this attack

354
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,640
another interesting scenario amazon has

355
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,469
three buckets right what you want to do

356
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,270
like you know this is the thing we were

357
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,220
analyzing phone in the some of the

358
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,930
Chinese malware there and all that you

359
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,660
know executable files and stuff like

360
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,370
that and then it can be directly

361
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,800
included one or the other way in two

362
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,170
different attacks and then you can these

363
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,120
files can be downloaded on the fly but

364
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,300
caution is that it's still stored in the

365
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,760
Amazon s3 buckets another example of the

366
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,199
square wave right which means that you

367
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,720
know calling scamp's that happen on the

368
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,390
fly this kind of you know malicious

369
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,460
pages one or the other way you so social

370
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,710
engineering another kind of set can

371
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,440
still be hosted on the s3 buckets right

372
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,900
and then different kind of attacks can

373
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,010
be triggered so this is a few examples

374
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,079
that we are talking I was going to

375
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:22,100
continue give you more flavor of the

376
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:24,800
direct malware distribution again this

377
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,470
is an example of office 365 you know one

378
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,140
try where it talks about Android malware

379
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,360
you know and then the host it you know

380
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:35,150
there and then you can do different that

381
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,460
you know mechanisms here to actually you

382
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,530
know build a full attack vector out of

383
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,410
it but it's still staying and all one

384
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,750
tribe nobody's picking it up another

385
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:48,589
example in office 365 is that okay you

386
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:51,560
have an attachment of malicious document

387
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:53,780
like the docx file or PowerPoint file

388
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,270
excel file whatever it is right and then

389
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,130
started sharing directly to the other

390
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,220
users and the enterprise as well right

391
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,600
because it is attached to the office 365

392
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,320
have some like of advanced techniques

393
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,880
implemented to bypass the filters and

394
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,790
then you feel like it's good and then

395
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,380
you broadly shared a try what kind of

396
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,089
solutions you have in place to actually

397
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,160
prevent that broadly sharing your files

398
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:18,320
and things like that we'll talk about it

399
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,319
a bit later but these are the real wall

400
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,350
case studies that we have found another

401
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,860
this is an ERP based you know

402
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,070
cloud service called as a shoe

403
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,529
sugar saying right so we detected couple

404
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,839
of malware families there as well and

405
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:35,850
then you can clearly see you dissect it

406
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,529
you can clearly see you know there are a

407
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,920
lot of indicators that actually point to

408
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:44,130
that those are the cases another one is

409
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,430
like you know Dropbox has you spot right

410
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:49,470
earlier in the timeline and still being

411
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:52,140
used to distribute and build the botton

412
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,870
directly from the cloud app right the

413
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,069
problem here is that you know with these

414
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,690
kind of things you know people have a

415
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,459
trust factor with these cloud apps right

416
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,130
oh the link is in a box it can't be

417
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:04,170
malware or it is with the Dropbox can be

418
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,750
that bad but exactly that is not the

419
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,519
case with some advanced tactics these

420
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,459
things can be circumvented and can be

421
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:14,010
lead to a different attack factors so so

422
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:16,619
few of these you know examples were were

423
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,329
actually targeted against you know the

424
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,519
direct malware distribution which is

425
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:24,479
kind of pretty basic as well but let

426
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,970
let's take a step ahead relay attacks

427
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,829
which means that you can host some sort

428
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,350
of you know application code whether

429
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:33,719
it's an HTML or GS like JavaScript code

430
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,490
on the cloud app and then whenever the

431
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,529
phishing attack happened the link goes

432
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,209
to the cloud app but the malware is not

433
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,160
hosted on the cloud app it's simply

434
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:43,949
acting as a hop channel so the

435
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,240
JavaScript code will be running there in

436
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:47,160
the backend because certain cloud

437
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,370
applications allow that and from there

438
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,160
onwards you'll be redirected to de mal

439
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,110
were driven website and interesting

440
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,910
point in that case is that again trust

441
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,560
factor you feel that okay I'm still

442
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,230
going to Google Drive I'm still going to

443
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,660
s3 I won't be having any problem but

444
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,939
again at the end of the day the link is

445
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,659
redirecting to do somewhere else so

446
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:12,720
relay attacks right in this case cloud

447
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,459
app is simply a hop channel but when it

448
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,230
comes to threat intelligence we have to

449
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,419
dissect we have to build threat models

450
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,990
like this direct malware distribution

451
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:25,140
relay attacks and now the question is is

452
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:28,349
it possible to have your HTML code GS

453
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,179
code malware code everything placed into

454
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:32,639
the cloud app and then trigger a in

455
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:35,309
cloud drive-by download it is possible

456
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,820
and we demonstrated that so in the layer

457
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:39,730
tack as I mentioned simply you know HTML

458
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,350
web page Java

459
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,570
has to be there it has to be made

460
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,820
publicly available so that you know it

461
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,740
has can be included into the attack

462
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,389
because if you're not sharing the fall

463
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,190
that is publicly available you cannot

464
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,530
use it in the broad set of attack and

465
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,000
things like that or even in the targeted

466
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,090
attack because you have to include that

467
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,760
file so that it can get stranded so that

468
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,820
we won't see like 403 forbidden so this

469
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,650
is an example of how the relay code

470
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:09,970
which is an obvious gated one looks like

471
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:11,290
so I think you guys have gone through

472
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,929
the JavaScript the obvious case

473
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,909
scenarios you can clearly feel this is a

474
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:25,270
Dean Edward Packard the basic Packard

475
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:27,910
and then once this this was an example

476
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:30,220
we used earlier but there are many cloud

477
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:36,610
apps that can be used for the same set

478
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:38,080
of attack so now we will talk about in

479
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,330
cloud drive-by download the most

480
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,750
advanced one right in this case the

481
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:46,149
scenario is this one all the four matrix

482
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,790
need to be there the cloud storage app

483
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,370
need to host HTML web page containing

484
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,230
JavaScript as well as malware e is also

485
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:55,659
uploaded on a cloud app with the

486
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,630
camouflage techniques making sure that

487
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,830
the cloud apps won't scan it then

488
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,980
JavaScript which is going to run in the

489
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,320
system is is going to include that file

490
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:08,230
which is still on the cloud application

491
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,178
itself and all you need to do is that

492
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,120
you have to just provide the link to the

493
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:15,160
cloud app that's it and everything's

494
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,469
gonna happen in the cloud app itself the

495
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,110
way you design it and your system gets

496
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,270
infected and this is the third level

497
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,189
which I call as like door at once try by

498
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,809
download attack because in this case you

499
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,460
don't have to put only direct malware

500
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,020
you don't have to put only delay code

501
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,660
but you have to put all things in the

502
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,020
place a kind of hybrid attack but this

503
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:40,290
is sustainable let's take a look and you

504
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,290
can examine yourself about Utah

505
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,860
okay so this is one example of the

506
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,889
Google dry one we don't want to use

507
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,629
because after this attack is not

508
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,210
possible on Google Drive the reason for

509
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:10,520
that is Google deprecated all the HTML

510
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,020
and JavaScript functionality but this

511
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,970
attack can be triggered out on the other

512
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,860
side of cloud apps so that's why we're

513
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,600
showing the thing so let's say in the

514
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,250
phishing email you got this link right

515
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,320
so this link is going through somewhere

516
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,330
Google Drive right you think it is a

517
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,330
Fanta Gatorade social engineering attack

518
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:30,320
but we're still going to a trusted cloud

519
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:32,000
app but exactly the line I have put up

520
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,230
these notifications in between just to

521
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,179
let you know what is going on the

522
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:38,660
backend so the JavaScript code is

523
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:43,550
executed you clicked it okay you go to

524
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:46,160
this web page and there you see you got

525
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,800
impacted so we use the Zeus bot sample

526
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,450
which can be easily detectable but even

527
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,770
in the real world attack scenario you

528
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,190
won't be even seeing that notification

529
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:56,900
you just click on the link it's done you

530
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:00,320
got infected and when you have like

531
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,210
different advanced techniques then you

532
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,610
can also bypass the antivirus as well

533
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,580
let's go into it so this is a view spot

534
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,770
which was hosted on the app you can

535
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,470
clearly see the Hydra MZ header which is

536
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:18,020
an executable file and when you you know

537
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:19,460
render the file it looks like this but

538
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,740
this attack won't work on Google Drive

539
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,990
right now because the top of the all the

540
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,030
other functionalities but as I mentioned

541
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,679
earlier you can test this kind of flavor

542
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:30,050
of attacks and all the other cloud apps

543
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:35,809
which still provide spotting JavaScript

544
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:37,820
and HTML so this I simply refreshed it

545
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:39,230
JavaScript gets triggered again it is

546
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,139
showing you how the JavaScript is

547
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:46,040
creating a frame and then you do it

548
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,990
again in this thing this is just a 1 so

549
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,760
you can clearly see the Zeus car

550
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,040
download it onto your system executed

551
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,530
but then you are respected up but you

552
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,870
can remove all the other things you know

553
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,710
notifications stuff like that simple and

554
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,928
stealth

555
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,580
just click the link everything's gonna

556
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:05,929
happen by a cloud app and you are

557
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:10,428
infected well sorry there was the attack

558
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:10,680
s4d in in cloud driver download so let's

559
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,720
take

560
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,280
a few examples that we have seen earlier

561
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,560
and other researchers have also talked

562
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,720
about it like command control operations

563
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,060
right which means that you know certain

564
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,850
cloud applications provide agha services

565
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:27,000
or functionalities that can be used as

566
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,889
an indicators for by the attackers to

567
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,630
build a command and control channel what

568
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,450
it means by that is you know if your end

569
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,160
a system is infected and then there is

570
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,990
some communication needs to be happen

571
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,120
with the command and control server it

572
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,070
will be relayed through the cloud app so

573
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,600
your data have some mechanism set up in

574
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,820
one of the compromised account in the

575
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,070
cloud app and from there onwards it can

576
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,980
go there right rather than the end user

577
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,649
is hitting the command control server

578
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,180
directly it's gonna hit the cloud app

579
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,610
check on some of the functionalities and

580
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,950
then attacker will able to figure it out

581
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,169
what's going on so it was like in you

582
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,970
know I think one or two three years or

583
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,570
years one of the first variant was the

584
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:08,310
Mac adopts malware but we did find you

585
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,350
don't plug extract that was like you

586
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:13,740
know distributed through Dropbox and

587
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,510
several of the other scenarios but this

588
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,120
is a kind of very advanced level you

589
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,040
know so it can also be boiled down to

590
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,379
the scenario which we discussed earlier

591
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,690
like cloud apps as a relay channels and

592
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,850
you can have like some code sitting in

593
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,560
between so that people believe okay you

594
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,899
are hitting the cloud ass but indirectly

595
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,550
you are sending certain signals to that

596
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,550
cloud app which is being picked up by

597
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:39,690
the remote attacker for command and

598
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:41,340
control operations now as earlier we

599
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,960
talked about taxonomy of the targeted

600
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,179
cyber attacks you can clearly see how

601
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,340
cyber basically cloud applications are

602
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,680
fitting inside those buckets like in

603
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:53,189
factions command and control and things

604
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,020
like that similarly as a little bit more

605
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:57,240
details about that you know how the

606
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:00,480
proxy channels were created using that

607
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:04,620
malware it's a little bit you know old

608
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,530
variant but we haven't seen precisely

609
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,090
now a lot of attacks where the command

610
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,760
and control channels are created using

611
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,889
cloud apps but there were few but when

612
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,080
we talk about volumes of attacks there

613
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:19,680
was not exactly there right now at the

614
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,970
moment so let's take a look into some up

615
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,960
couple of the data exfiltration

616
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,960
scenarios

617
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,110
about fishing earlier where was the case

618
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,030
was to in fact the systems here fishing

619
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:33,070
was triggered where was the target is to

620
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,379
actually take your credentials out right

621
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,450
because in this case you know you can

622
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,100
sure you can you can be fooled by a

623
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,870
social engineering attack and you can

624
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,449
provide your credentials but everything

625
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:45,219
is hosted or not to aliens can happen in

626
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,470
this case as well first where the

627
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,600
fishing web pages are hosted on the

628
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,970
cloud app or they have actually me

629
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,580
making the same behavior same view of

630
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,650
the cloud apps and then hosted somewhere

631
00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:00,490
and then embedded one or the other way

632
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:02,170
into the attack channel so this is one

633
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,150
of the first example you can clearly see

634
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:08,230
you know these came out the very first

635
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:09,970
one we analyzed here they were talking

636
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:12,490
about exploiting the you know SSO

637
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,880
functionality somehow they are able to

638
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:17,470
actually you know because let me explain

639
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,570
a little bit in more detail because most

640
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,220
of these cloud Apple apps work in while

641
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,399
your single sign of high education these

642
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,020
days and once it is done you know there

643
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,090
are different set of accounts that are

644
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,490
integrated as a federated identities

645
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,199
into the same pool right so you get

646
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,760
through SSO you get into it then you

647
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,950
have like some another small accounts

648
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,050
created for some other services that can

649
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,430
be also be accessed right away so there

650
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,200
was some flaw in there where they

651
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:44,380
exploited this functionality and able to

652
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,180
you know actually inject add-on into the

653
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,270
browser which actually doing some kind

654
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,250
of data exfiltration and other scenarios

655
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:53,950
but let's take a look at the another

656
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,950
example 40 because this one is very

657
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,660
critical these days and need to be

658
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:01,870
understood a little bit more detail and

659
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:04,270
the idea for that is Amazon AWS Ligon as

660
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,219
the most used you know infrastructure as

661
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,590
a service off your service platform at

662
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,030
the moment in the challenge with that is

663
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:11,889
that big you know you need to access the

664
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,540
console where you are spinning your VP

665
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,580
see you're spinning your instances in

666
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:19,060
the VP see how a VP see peering is done

667
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:21,340
a lot of functionalities it all happens

668
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,990
why the AWS console so if somebody is

669
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,360
able to trigger the social engineering

670
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,620
attack a phishing attack and able to get

671
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,340
your credentials then you can clearly

672
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,229
see your whole AB app either power apps

673
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,179
or whatever your whole infrastructure is

674
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,740
compromised you know you can do a lot of

675
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,050
things and we have seen these kind of

676
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,280
attacks and the wide right now

677
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,350
where they have come a one or the other

678
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,649
way and spin up instances on the fly and

679
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:46,360
then you see that cost is growing up

680
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,550
because those instances are either being

681
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,280
used for like nefarious activities like

682
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:54,370
coal mining and other kind of things or

683
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,350
distributing malware as well but another

684
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,600
example we're gonna deep dive into the

685
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:00,100
adobe clouds right we were doing some

686
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,780
research and you're gonna make sure that

687
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,149
because nobody has this like on building

688
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,090
cloud how attackers are going after it

689
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:09,130
of course fishing but we came across a

690
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,750
sudden you know remote servers where

691
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:13,770
we're able to get an access and all that

692
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:17,050
and where we discovered these kind of

693
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:19,500
scenarios so let's take a look into one

694
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,500
of the another

695
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,809
so we were able to get access to this

696
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,480
where we were analyzing because this one

697
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:46,629
is using a lot of different you know

698
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,429
hosting malicious web pages and we came

699
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,140
across this one like it all be document

700
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:51,700
cloud and we were like bit interested

701
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:57,669
like how this phishing attack is carried

702
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:59,679
out and the basic turf across this

703
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:01,210
attack is that it's very simple big

704
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,919
enough social engineer you they gonna

705
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,169
say like if you really want to access

706
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,299
any document on the adobe cloud you need

707
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:09,250
to provide the credentials so this is

708
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,870
how it is all carried out and we were

709
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,460
just doing some testing try to

710
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,168
understand you know how the whole

711
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,419
workflow or this phishing attack is

712
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:20,049
working but these kind of attacks are

713
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:21,850
happening at very rapid pace so you can

714
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:24,460
clearly see it is redirect you the poor

715
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:28,809
PHP all your credentials went on to that

716
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:31,150
remote server and then there onwards we

717
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:33,639
are just redirecting to the same page or

718
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:36,690
some kind of fake document that is

719
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,820
hosted somewhere and we are seeing

720
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:42,220
instances of these kind of attacks at an

721
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,820
exponential rate these days as well and

722
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:48,250
it's just not all only one cloud app

723
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:51,820
office 365 is like also targeted a lot

724
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,919
these days considering because the

725
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,770
volume is so high every single other

726
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,409
organization has been now either forced

727
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:03,760
to or they have moved to the office 365

728
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:06,669
scenarios and you can clearly see all

729
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:10,330
the credentials are routed to P or PHP

730
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:11,950
page and thanks all this attack was it

731
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,539
looks pretty pretty neat in the sense

732
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:18,039
that we have constructed two scenarios

733
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:19,510
but this will keep on going on and now

734
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:21,340
let's take a look into the another one

735
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,100
still a phishing one but I really want

736
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:27,668
to give you a flavor we are seeing these

737
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,709
kind of scenarios as well office 365 SSO

738
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:32,110
identities was set up with the sam'l and

739
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,760
all those kind of things and again we

740
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,770
were able to actually got an access to

741
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,340
one of the remote server we were doing

742
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:42,240
some analysis and then let's take a look

743
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,240
at this attack as well

744
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,500
so this was like some of the compromise

745
00:29:50,220 --> 00:30:01,860
domine and all that and then their own

746
00:29:52,500 --> 00:30:04,260
words entirely that you know complete

747
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:09,240
replica of how the legitimate Outlook

748
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:10,559
page looks like office 361 but they have

749
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,299
made some changes we are they gonna

750
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,690
redirect traffic back to your attacker

751
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:17,400
control domain

752
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,780
it looks legit but when it is like you

753
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,500
know embedded with some other kind of

754
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:24,240
wireframes and all that it becomes very

755
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,220
realistic in that sense but if you see

756
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:34,530
here the whole attack that is carried

757
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:36,570
out in the same way same thing and then

758
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:40,168
you can extract your credentials once it

759
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:41,820
is gone then you know your gums can be

760
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:45,510
compromised now the question is very

761
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:48,720
simple how many users were able to

762
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:52,140
identify that you know these kind of

763
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,790
attacks are not legitimate right and of

764
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,290
course people who are very security

765
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,659
savvy they will figure it out one or the

766
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:00,409
other vapor there definitely be people

767
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:02,790
who kind of fall for it right and

768
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,080
nowadays we have already seen you know

769
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,909
enterprises are triggering you know

770
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,439
simulated phishing attacks and all that

771
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,570
but even if you see the results you

772
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,580
still find people that fall to those

773
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,770
kind of attacks one or the other way but

774
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:17,159
this is all happening in you know cloud

775
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:19,200
app app space and all that so I want to

776
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,780
talk a little bit more detail about on

777
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,760
the daleks filtration scenario and we're

778
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,928
gonna tie back with the threat attackers

779
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,330
sly you know we were talking about

780
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:29,970
erroneous employees making mistakes if

781
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:32,189
you look at this particular example in

782
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:34,740
there is like an international exposure

783
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,530
you can clearly see you get an access to

784
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,940
this one couple of excel files and all

785
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,250
that which is like you know already

786
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,350
username and password sent to it right

787
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,880
and the interesting scenario is that you

788
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,799
have a username and password it was

789
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,140
belonging to a one specific organization

790
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,030
somewhere and you are able to access

791
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,210
their gmail accounts because those were

792
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:58,080
not having kind of you know SSO in place

793
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:59,850
at that point of time so again

794
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,309
case I don't think so attackers need to

795
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,049
go after you know finding very you know

796
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:06,299
kind of advanced flaws in the cloud apps

797
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:08,539
right all they can do is to start the

798
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:11,370
fuzzing approach we'll take an example

799
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:12,090
look into the example as well try to

800
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,860
figure it out

801
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:15,299
these dogs and start analyzing what is

802
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,479
already have a label on the intersect

803
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:19,799
right so easy

804
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,630
another interesting scenario as you can

805
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:23,908
clearly see one of the marketing agency

806
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:27,630
they disclose all of their username and

807
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:31,350
passwords to different websites on cloud

808
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,450
apps as well invoices for example if

809
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,939
you're living in the world of business

810
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:38,070
competitiveness trying to be one of the

811
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,740
biggest firm which are actually you know

812
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,299
providing some services to an end to be

813
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,130
on an organization and then disclosed

814
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:46,440
all the invoices you can clearly see

815
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:48,779
what amount is gonna be there and then

816
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,690
if you're going after the same point

817
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:53,250
right you can actually pay a lot of you

818
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,580
know interesting scenarios here as well

819
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:58,649
but again all that is possible because

820
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,779
they are not securing these documents on

821
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:02,518
the cloud apps right whatever the issues

822
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:04,019
are rather erroneous mistakes or

823
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:05,250
disgruntled employee or an actor is

824
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:07,860
doing that these things are happening

825
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,960
and this is the one of the tests we

826
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,689
conducted earlier you can build Google

827
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,690
Docs or you can use certain set of tools

828
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,850
in this one of the first example we

829
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:21,210
targeted Amazon s3 buckets I think this

830
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:22,620
issue is being talked a lot we release

831
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:26,549
some of the blog post on this front as

832
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:28,678
well but if you constructed Google Docs

833
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:30,720
and certain things like that and then

834
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:37,980
you run it continuously by using some of

835
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:40,230
the google api earlier other files that

836
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,299
are publicly available with certain kind

837
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,039
of patterns let's say I wanna see give

838
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:46,230
me the list of the files which have

839
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:50,190
username in it or password in it and

840
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:52,200
similarly with the s3 buckets right you

841
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,330
can actually start fuzzing on-the-fly

842
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,740
which actually gives you the idea what

843
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,960
kind of buckets we are finding in the

844
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:00,149
east west region or in the golf-club

845
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,100
region depending on the availability

846
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:04,350
zones and how they are three buckets are

847
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,209
being it are deployed and all that but

848
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,339
in this case attackers are not doing

849
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,199
anything extremely different what they

850
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:12,029
are going after is that what is already

851
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,710
available on the cloud apps

852
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,450
I wanna have some intelligent tools I'm

853
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,418
gonna build them some scripts I'm gonna

854
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:20,399
go after these cloud apps public

855
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:21,779
publicly available documents or the kind

856
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,000
of stuff they have exposed on the

857
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,340
Internet and I think that makes a lot of

858
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,020
difference because the more you want to

859
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,909
spend time on finding vulnerabilities in

860
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,009
certain scenarios if you actually start

861
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,530
with this kind of recognizance kind of

862
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,800
scenarios or fingerprinting scenarios I

863
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:39,240
think you can get a lot of information

864
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,940
information actually boils down to the

865
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,560
visibility or in any attack if you want

866
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,899
to conduct any successful attack down

867
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,730
the lane visibility is the big key which

868
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:50,879
actually comes from the information and

869
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:52,530
you can clearly once you trigger these

870
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,379
kind of activities our fuzzing on the

871
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,210
fly I think you can get a lot more out

872
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,920
of it and which is kind of a pretty

873
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,420
interesting and we found it we reported

874
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,280
it to the vendors and all that they

875
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,840
acknowledged it they removed those

876
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,360
scenarios but I think this is a

877
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:09,870
recurring problem because humans are

878
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,610
involved in there as well now I also

879
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:14,490
want to talk a little bit in the context

880
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:16,320
of acts filtration as well as infection

881
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:19,259
but I'll talk and we'll talk about

882
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,540
acceleration there so when I completed

883
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,430
my PhD it was completely revolve around

884
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,680
man-in-the-browser attacks you know how

885
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:27,419
are these you know you know malware

886
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,240
install in the end user system circum

887
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:31,620
and the integrity of the browsers right

888
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,229
these days cloud apps are mostly

889
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:37,140
accessed why a browser itself right you

890
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,610
go to a box comm or any other one you

891
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,310
provide your credentials in the browser

892
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:43,080
why a browser session is created you can

893
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:47,040
access your files if you are not using

894
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,569
the client itself in that case when we

895
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,279
talk about man-in-the-browser which

896
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:52,440
simply means that you know system is

897
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,480
compromised it can be any driver

898
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,580
download attack that we have discussed

899
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,170
earlier the payload the malware is

900
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,540
running in the system and it is waiting

901
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:03,630
for you to open a specific cloud app

902
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:06,450
right for example any you know cloud

903
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:09,780
application box Dropbox and all that and

904
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:12,450
as soon as you put your credentials in

905
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,850
and submit the form button right right

906
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,189
at the same point the malware is

907
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,380
actually monitoring the low level API is

908
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:21,510
in the browser so you sees that okay you

909
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,980
access that app now there onwards we are

910
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,320
providing credentials and then it's

911
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,950
suddenly implemented hook into it which

912
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,420
means that

913
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,450
anything that's gonna route it directly

914
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,869
to the web server gonna write why the

915
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:35,578
dieter that is being created by the

916
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:37,380
malware itself at that point it can

917
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:39,990
steal your credentials give it to the

918
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:42,030
command and control server and then your

919
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:44,040
account is compromised as well but the

920
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,570
little bit is this is more on the you

921
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,609
know compromise that is happening in the

922
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,750
end-user systems rather than the

923
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:51,180
application itself

924
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,400
similarly man in the cloud this is a

925
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,160
variant again came in where again the

926
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,960
malware install on the end user system

927
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:00,000
actually steals your tokens from that

928
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,099
client that you have set up because okay

929
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,410
you have this particular folder that is

930
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,880
a you know being shared you just upload

931
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:08,430
the file or put the file in that folder

932
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,960
it's synced back to the cloud app there

933
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,740
onwards this kind of attack but it's

934
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,900
more focused on the compromised systems

935
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:17,790
and all that but these are also used a

936
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,170
lot but I think man and the browser is

937
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:22,650
being staying here for last couple of

938
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:24,359
years and Strama stay there but again

939
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,980
once it is there it can accelerate data

940
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:28,140
one or the other way basically your

941
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,880
credentials you know user behavior and

942
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,420
think like that and from there onwards

943
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,880
they can build additional set of tags

944
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,930
now we did some research on this part as

945
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,609
well we've talked about cloud

946
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,410
application you know one ability

947
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:43,140
exploitation because you know you have

948
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:45,779
this different cloud applications they

949
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:49,560
are created in such a way then you can

950
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,270
also find some flaws in it and again as

951
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,369
I mentioned earlier attackers basically

952
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,599
abuse the trust element you have a de

953
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:56,280
tried and then if you find

954
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:00,240
vulnerabilities in these apps right

955
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:02,369
there can be very very disastrous in

956
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,078
that sense so there is a couple of you

957
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:06,329
we highlighted here you know several

958
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,859
cross-site scripting or what miss

959
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:10,349
configuration in one of the biggest

960
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:14,640
cloud app provider and there was a

961
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:19,530
really really a bad one design flaw in

962
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:22,560
one of the cloud app wider website SSO

963
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,940
issues and all that did just this

964
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,799
because the part of the responsible

965
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,900
disco your research I cannot name the

966
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,599
you know cloud applications where we

967
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,150
found these vulnerabilities but they

968
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:36,119
were patched earlier because under those

969
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:40,020
guidelines we have to report them to the

970
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:41,760
vendors but again from the exploitation

971
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,009
one of you you find out well mobility

972
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,350
try to work out how you gonna carve a

973
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,120
full attack out of it by exploiting it

974
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:51,000
one or the other way and we did provide

975
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:54,839
you know the use cases and the way how

976
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,590
it can be exploited to those vendors but

977
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,030
now these couple of these

978
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:01,230
vulnerabilities have already been

979
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:03,420
patched and fixed now I think I just

980
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:05,250
wanna do a little recap we started with

981
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,930
you know why cloud is booming you know

982
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,180
what are the threat actors in the cloud

983
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,710
application space and then from there

984
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,049
onwards we set up the one simple

985
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,330
taxonomy of targeted cyberattacks talk

986
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:17,450
about infection scenarios talk about

987
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:21,270
command and control data exfiltration

988
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:23,250
and things like that and then we discuss

989
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,050
several of the cloud application attacks

990
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,330
you know for example direct malware

991
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:30,150
distribution in relay attacks in cloud

992
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,770
attacks command and control attacks how

993
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,960
they abuse how attackers abused the

994
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:36,450
functionalities of the cloud apps to

995
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,520
conduct those operations and then we

996
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:41,310
look into several real-time use case

997
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,560
studies of you know dialects filtration

998
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:45,750
and all that and we understand the

999
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,970
problem but where we stand with respect

1000
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,730
to the enterprise security at the

1001
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,980
monarch right you know vulnerabilities

1002
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,750
exist abuse cases out there you know how

1003
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,690
cloud apps are being abused how

1004
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,710
attackers are going after these attacks

1005
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:01,050
but I really want to touch on the topic

1006
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:03,540
of window for exposure I think it is

1007
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:04,830
very important topic but I think we

1008
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,500
should touch a little bit and then I

1009
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:13,080
think we are almost getting to the end

1010
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:14,730
of our journey here let's take an

1011
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,350
example you know you have a sensitive

1012
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:20,910
document that is exposed why a cloud

1013
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:22,830
application right so at that time T the

1014
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:25,170
document is exposed which is containing

1015
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,910
sensitive information the window of

1016
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,250
detection is a time taken by any

1017
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:31,950
solution or an individual to actually

1018
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:34,320
detect like that document is exposed and

1019
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:37,589
from there onwards the time taken to

1020
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,870
actually fix that issue comes in the

1021
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,000
video of prevention so when we talk

1022
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,750
about window of exposure it's the world

1023
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,070
of detection as well as the prevention

1024
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,170
there it doesn't make any sense you

1025
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,440
detect an attack but then you didn't do

1026
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:53,760
anything you can't prevent the attack

1027
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,520
without having visible

1028
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,480
on the fly right so that actually

1029
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,850
entails to the Windows Explorer to use

1030
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,070
cases arise in this scenario and the one

1031
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:07,319
is that if you're will if you are not

1032
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:08,640
able to detect it at a white time or you

1033
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,380
are not able to prevent it at the right

1034
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:16,080
time the attack is still gonna be there

1035
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:19,200
one or the other way and then if you are

1036
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,750
doing one and not doing the another then

1037
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,060
it's also a problem which entails again

1038
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:26,100
to the point the one point you detected

1039
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:28,560
an attack you have to build your

1040
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,569
scenario of prevention right there

1041
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,330
detection alone doesn't lead anywhere

1042
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,130
it's August and a hybrid approach that

1043
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:37,650
you have to follow to do it so you have

1044
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:43,350
to reduce the window effects foyer which

1045
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:45,360
is done by multiple scenarios to

1046
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,770
minimize that window of exposure that's

1047
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,600
how you are going to tackle the attack

1048
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,940
that's how you're going to circumvent

1049
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,970
those attacks by reducing the exposure

1050
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:57,840
and this can be mapped back to any

1051
00:41:53,970 --> 00:42:00,569
attack scenario any attack scenario you

1052
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,840
can use this concept to build the

1053
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:05,730
scenarios so we talked about no window

1054
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,740
of exposure but a little bit you know

1055
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,650
going after some of the mitigation and

1056
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,600
prevention strategy I think you mention

1057
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:15,630
as well there's nothing you know one

1058
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:17,279
gold shot out there what is all about is

1059
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:19,440
that is in always an hybrid approach

1060
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,820
right people can say that okay machine

1061
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,860
learning is an answer you know

1062
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,290
artificial intelligence is the answer

1063
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,850
but I can still back like majority of

1064
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,980
the vendors still use signature and

1065
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:31,920
heuristics as a part of certain

1066
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:33,510
indicators to feed your algorithms which

1067
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,700
uses machine learning and all that you

1068
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:38,370
just cannot avoid signature so you just

1069
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,919
cannot avoid heuristics you can minimize

1070
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:43,410
them but then you still need them to

1071
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,780
build up a full sphere and then map it

1072
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:47,850
back to your algorithms to get a bigger

1073
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,090
picture rather than stringing on a once

1074
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:53,100
in a small points like auditing

1075
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,900
detection and prevention all manners

1076
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,180
right auditing you just kind of feel of

1077
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,710
visibility detection you have algorithms

1078
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:03,480
running you can fetch the data from your

1079
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:05,340
auditing components and then you build

1080
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,870
some detection algorithms which cannot

1081
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,060
detect certain kind of things but then

1082
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,430
you

1083
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,020
need to have policy enforcement

1084
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:13,000
prevention scenarios as well how long it

1085
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,580
will take it depends on the how good the

1086
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,500
platform is right you can have a simple

1087
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,299
solution a box sitting there okay we can

1088
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,430
detect an attack but you're not helping

1089
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:24,220
us to prevent an attack which means that

1090
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:26,770
you want that box to get integrated into

1091
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,299
your existing solution more pain for the

1092
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,920
administrators more pain for the

1093
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,560
security people but if you have a

1094
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,910
wonderful platform that is going

1095
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,880
basically gonna do everything for you I

1096
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:38,740
think it makes a lot of sense and it

1097
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,870
reduces the window of exposure in this

1098
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,700
scenario so you can have multiple

1099
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:44,529
approaches you know pattern search and

1100
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:48,540
analysis of course signature detection

1101
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:50,980
or writing signature patterns heuristics

1102
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,110
automatic ignition signature generation

1103
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,610
as well policies and procedures machine

1104
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:56,950
learning again the message is very

1105
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:59,530
simple and clear it's always gonna be

1106
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:02,430
the hybrid approach one thing is not

1107
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:04,990
going to lead to a substantial solution

1108
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:06,910
so we talked about why there's a

1109
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:10,479
platform driven approaches much more

1110
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:12,879
needed to actually go after you know

1111
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,480
detecting and preventing cloud apps so

1112
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,700
that being said I think I'm pretty much

1113
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,160
done with the presentation right now but

1114
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,700
we would love to have your questions if

1115
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,540
revani

1116
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:27,540
and then love to discuss and share the

1117
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,540
scenarios

1118
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:32,349
[Music]

1119
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,890
so I think I'm just repeating the

1120
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:46,570
question again so that everybody on the

1121
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:49,120
same page I think what we call the

1122
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,890
question here is like you know lamenting

1123
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,580
a multi-factor authentication solution

1124
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:56,440
is we need additional things without a

1125
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,640
doubt MFA is a very important thing

1126
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,060
where we get segregating the

1127
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:02,529
authentication channels right but the

1128
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,450
question is the problem is much more

1129
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,400
bigger than you so like MFA you can

1130
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,529
prevent like a compromise and things

1131
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,680
like that but when we look at the bigger

1132
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:14,560
threat model models about a particular

1133
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,870
technology it goes way beyond it

1134
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,910
that's why always that we're going to

1135
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:20,890
give the answer is like hybrid approach

1136
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:24,040
right we need defense-in-depth

1137
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:27,310
strategies right me people can still say

1138
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:32,350
right and you viruses are dead but they

1139
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:33,850
are not they are not okay it has been

1140
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:36,160
reduced to certain sphere but they are

1141
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:39,130
not why was not that every organization

1142
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,230
have it how in fact if they are that's a

1143
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:42,850
separate piece right so nothing is under

1144
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:44,890
person so that's why security law is

1145
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:48,310
considered as a process right defense

1146
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:50,799
and that I am FA without a cell right in

1147
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:52,660
even in my organization people cannot

1148
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,670
have an accounts adding everything up

1149
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,500
without a method right the nurses setup

1150
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,790
in such a way that as soon as somebody

1151
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,040
does anything is going to trigger up

1152
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:01,720
account will be locked down so those

1153
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,150
things are there but there should not be

1154
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,459
entirely the solutions if there's a

1155
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,660
multiple aspects to it the way cloud

1156
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,750
apps are being exploited

1157
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:12,730
then then definitely helps without a

1158
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,910
doubt but they are much more to it as

1159
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,910
well

1160
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:42,570
I think it depends on the configuration

1161
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,369
okay let me do you actually the cautions

1162
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:46,830
because if you have a MFA in place the

1163
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:48,450
vws accounts are being you know used you

1164
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:50,130
can have tokens but you can have that

1165
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,720
complete session and able all the time

1166
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,599
with all that many functionalities and

1167
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,430
it is getting bit restricted now I think

1168
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:58,200
it depends on the it depends on the

1169
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:00,540
configuration I can give you a real

1170
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,819
piece any idea right the people who are

1171
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,950
doing quality assurance work right in

1172
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,660
the cloud drive they have to do what

1173
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,618
dimension for regression analysis and

1174
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,890
things like that right

1175
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:13,410
when the Builder automated go right the

1176
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:15,779
way they can abuse and mapping sudden

1177
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:17,520
scenarios as well one of the piece and

1178
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:21,180
that importance there the complexity for

1179
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,710
them is great hi so the way the design

1180
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,839
will depends on that strategy you want

1181
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,390
to make sure the few AWS accounts well

1182
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:29,160
that specific functionality is entirely

1183
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:31,379
segregated into the another environment

1184
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,230
and that restriction should be applied

1185
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:36,440
we have seen some cases where that

1186
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:39,150
automation scenarios have lead to

1187
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:42,450
bypassing of sudden stuff and then

1188
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:45,750
resulted in you know running some

1189
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:47,368
unauthorized VPC instances and all that

1190
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:50,730
but again that depends on the

1191
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:53,400
configuration right if I go a little bit

1192
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:55,410
more detail here API like AWS API is for

1193
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:59,099
all the I am rules and all at the end of

1194
00:47:55,410 --> 00:48:01,618
the day you need to have you know sat

1195
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:04,440
immediate to fix as well but how much it

1196
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:06,180
race is the complexity and everyone is

1197
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,750
on the same page that matters at the end

1198
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,520
of the day so Alex Garrett is all about

1199
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:14,130
you cannot restrict because you have to

1200
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,810
find there should be a flexibility there

1201
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,820
functionality there that's why you go

1202
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:20,670
often when people there's and the more

1203
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:23,160
you sometimes go in like your layer 7

1204
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,530
for example which is like cool to the

1205
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,930
drops of your V PC at that time you get

1206
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:29,910
little bit relaxed as well but for

1207
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:35,040
example how many guys are actually

1208
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:36,960
take database connections inside the BBC

1209
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,000
cause this can impact your they dancing

1210
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,950
I'm just talking on several aspects here

1211
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,660
so it depends right where you have to

1212
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,730
get a little easier we're having a

1213
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,620
little restricted but defense in that

1214
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,630
case a way to actually go it's not

1215
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:51,870
parameter only just not only antivirus

1216
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:54,090
this all you want is more to it example

1217
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:56,460
but you just cannot say that you know

1218
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:57,780
one technology is dead and then we are

1219
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,730
coming with a new no it's still there

1220
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:04,440
people are still making billions of

1221
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:32,400
dollars because of firewalls I think

1222
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:33,960
there's a lot more question your

1223
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,750
question again so because most of the

1224
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,880
applications being hosted on the on pram

1225
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:40,440
if they are actually means to go onto

1226
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,790
the cloud what kind of tools are being

1227
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,800
used to actually strengthen the security

1228
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:45,930
posture of that cloud application I

1229
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,850
think it's just not only a very a very

1230
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:50,370
direct answer to it and the reason for

1231
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:51,960
that is even in my authorization we have

1232
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:53,970
implemented a full process write a

1233
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,730
technical review crossfire which means

1234
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:59,759
that anything that is going on the cloud

1235
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:01,890
and have some external interfaces those

1236
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,750
need to be reviewed up from when I'm say

1237
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:05,759
reviewed is like a threat modeling is

1238
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,260
kind of lot of things on there as well

1239
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,640
and then what kind of additional

1240
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,440
processes you wanna implement

1241
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,410
downloading for example you put your

1242
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:16,680
application in the cloud what kind of

1243
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:18,420
PCP UDP ports are opened why your

1244
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,160
security groups and what kind of

1245
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,260
services are being exposed why that

1246
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,270
application component that is available

1247
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,070
on the Internet how effectively we

1248
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:27,810
effectively you are testing those how

1249
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:30,600
often you are testing those right and

1250
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:32,470
then you get a clear idea because one of

1251
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,810
the bigger problem and you go to the car

1252
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:36,368
that is so dynamic in nature with a load

1253
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:38,560
balancing and other kind of activities

1254
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:40,869
would have the SAS application you

1255
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,819
deploy you need to boost it on different

1256
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:45,130
production servers but again at the end

1257
00:50:42,819 --> 00:50:46,960
of the day the problem was to the point

1258
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:50,050
is that the configuration changes very

1259
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,520
fast right people like for security

1260
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:53,619
groups right how much ingress and egress

1261
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,569
filters you have deployed in the

1262
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:57,930
enterprise's right and things like that

1263
00:50:55,569 --> 00:51:00,849
so it changes very fast so in order to

1264
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:03,279
basically control that or manage that

1265
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:05,440
there are tools available but that is

1266
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,540
not only the solution it's a whole

1267
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,400
picture for modeling of the component

1268
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:11,500
that needs to be done and it has to be

1269
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,810
continuous otherwise a tough car and

1270
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,400
because somebody from like other team

1271
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:17,500
will come and spend the VP's instance

1272
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:21,339
and all that and open the pores and you

1273
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:22,960
don't have that visibility so now with

1274
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:25,299
the tools yeah you need to have some

1275
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,310
tools which call as like AWS monitoring

1276
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:29,950
tool which actually gives you the idea

1277
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:33,609
how your AWS accounts are monitor you

1278
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:35,200
need to deploy some you know tools for

1279
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:36,578
example rootkit hunters and other kind

1280
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,799
of fix in your production servers to

1281
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:40,300
give you the idea and then you have to

1282
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,800
have you know perform one ability

1283
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:45,430
assessment penetration testing

1284
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:47,140
continually in-house every month to get

1285
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:49,060
a feel of it where it is all about there

1286
00:51:47,140 --> 00:52:03,069
much more to it but that's all folks

1287
00:51:49,060 --> 00:52:04,540
fear be strong research engines and

1288
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:10,060
stuff like that so they are there for

1289
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:11,319
sure all right everyone thanks thanks

1290
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,100
for attending that all we really

1291
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:18,330
appreciate that

1292
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:18,330
[Applause]
