we meet once a month usually montón to

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,260
you and this is an effort that it is

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,430
basically a community effort what we try

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,610
to do is to help people to join the

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,640
information security industry as well as

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,969
we take experience InfoSec professionals

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,789
help doesn't want to join the industry

18
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:57,870
we do a lot of research in collaboration

19
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:00,329
on vulnerabilities exploitation we do

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,110
hackathons we do capture the flags and

21
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,409
we do all kinds of grassroots that we'll

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,400
call it a task that just to bring people

23
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:14,420
into the community we wear open walk on

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,299
everybody you don't have to have a

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,430

29
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,490
the idea is to promote collaborate and

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,140
help those who want to join the industry

31
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,820

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,449
efforts like this people that were

34
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,220

35
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,930
lives now they have great lives or

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,600
better lives by working in the

37
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,210
information security industry protecting

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,740

I've been doing conferences for now

70
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:43,560
eight years and I know that sometimes

71
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,290
because of the number of people and the

72
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,989
dynamics things sometimes make for

73
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,989
further gap you can blame me if you told

74
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,430
me at the end do anything right if you

75
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:57,600
tell me if you don't tell me there's

76
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:01,709
there's nothing I can do as far as the

77
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,870
code of conduct we are in private I

78
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,760
guess organization they do have the

79
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,470
caller conduct I don't think I need to

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,410
repeat that you all guys look very nice

81
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:14,670
and professional when I do hug Miami I

82
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:21,918
had to say it like three times because

83
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:25,740
you know obviously you can have alcohol

84
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,719
and I think this about it in Miami had

85
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:33,120
to say you can be naked you can have

86

technology that we don't know about like

104

to learn as much as we can this is

108
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,820
basically a study group we do have a

109
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,480
structure and that's how we're able to

110
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,169
get so many people do find jobs and

111
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:47,450
