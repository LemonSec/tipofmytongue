1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:08,220
okay why didn't you don't have to live

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,010
it he's like a special touch system ya

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:18,470
know mysteriously seeing you see you you

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:18,470
had like okay see how it's like

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:33,070
let let him do it there we go alright

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:40,940
it's an updated version of a talk that

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:46,730
we did in Europe with it the stock in

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:49,610
the Council of Europe and France and I'm

9
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,650
here with my partner in crime which Josa

10
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:57,050
there and Josa there is actually a

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:01:02,210
co-founder of happy valley so Joe was

12
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:03,739
part of the he's part of this he was

13
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,320
part of the co-creator he was a

14
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:10,429
co-creator of Hackney Valley with this

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:20,570
we started this like two years ago so we

16
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:24,170
do a lot of community work and he was a

17
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:26,839
participant in a hackathon that was done

18
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,030
at Facebook and there was a lot of data

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,700
he's gonna explain to you about the use

20
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,640
cases plus he's can explain to you some

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,709
of the initiatives that we that were

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,140
pursuing there will probably be a call

23
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:42,649
to action today and there will be a

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,530
follow-up for this so basically I'm

25
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:49,759
gonna I'm gonna go over pretty quick on

26
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:52,459
some things about the dark web because I

27
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,099
didn't say yeah right well speak about

28
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:57,440
using deep learning to uncover that way

29
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:00,259
malicious actors and the closed circle

30
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,759
so basically here's the lyrics for

31
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:06,770
nation of the dark what the dark web is

32
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,848
basically when you access by a door or

33
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:15,620
they can be also a document as well

34
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:18,530
there are some p2p type of Darkness not

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,510
to confuse deep web dark web deep web is

36
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:27,140
usually was behind a pay wall behind

37
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:31,250
forums or a private like anybody has

38
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:33,738
ever been to hell calm no no I mean it

39
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,450
was it's very possible get in I always

40
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:38,500
been curious to see what what is what is

41
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,500
in the hell calm

42
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,280
so seriously nobody nobody has ever had

43
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,200
OCD

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,150
okay they used to attack you with like

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,329
JavaScript you cannot come here

46
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:56,510
you cannot come here and it was all over

47
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:58,490
I like the surface way obviously we all

48
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,970
know that Google was at Facebook the the

49
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:10,430
Wikipedia and then the Deep Web which he

50
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:15,560
said was behind the people behind the

51
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:18,709
dark web is usually accessed by a door

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:22,959
which is the Onion Router a project that

53
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:27,140
was created initially for a good

54
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,110
objective that was to give oppressed

55
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:33,380
journalists or people a way of bypassing

56
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:36,290
firewalls by passing censorship and

57
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:40,880
communicating or see in the external

58
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:48,890
world we realized that that

59
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:51,709
unfortunately is not the case the Deep

60
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:58,760
Web or the dark web sorry has turned

61
00:03:51,709 --> 00:04:01,790
into a an absolute place for a crime and

62
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,620
some of the most horrible things you can

63
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,859
think of it's unfortunate it's still

64
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:10,750
being used in many instances for for

65
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:14,019
good reason for for freedom speech for

66
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:17,540
revealing information bread

67
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:19,489
whistleblowing type of activity but

68
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:28,310
unfortunately I would say the majority

69
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:31,400
of it is this is illegal porn sorry

70
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,350
yeah oh I wish I will go that in a

71
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,440
minute I actually I actually for this

72
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:40,760
presentation I took the time to try to

73
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,510
find pg-13 screen shots which we will

74
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,550
see in a minute so some of them what doc

75
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,490
well facts it's part of the Deep Web but

76
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,070
not all of it accessible mainly by a

77
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,350
door which is really cool O'Neil and not

78
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:59,150
index like standard search engines you

79
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:02,630
can there is actually dr. go can search

80
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,830
within the dark web Facebook I believe

81
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,830
has an own insight as well

82
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:14,800
provides a level anonymity acceptable

83
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:18,680
for criminal operators heavily monitor

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,229
regulated by law enforcement actions it

85
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,000
has very low latency I think we have a

86
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,729
lot of veterans here if you remember the

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,400
the internet in the 90s it feels a lot

88
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:31,539
like the Internet in the 90s like you

89
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,520
know that this raw HTML type of website

90
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:39,130
and also there's a lot of this is driven

91
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:43,930
by cryptocurrency so we have Bitcoin

92
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,930
Manero if they really like coin

93
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:51,890
here's some of the noticeable items in

94
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,320
the dark web you can buy guns you can

95
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,289
buy stolen or fake identities including

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,340
citizen chips

97
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:01,940
there are places where they actually

98
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,469
show passwords and everything drugs like

99
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,960
know where like seriously

100
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,740
looks like no one you can get any kind

101
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,960
of you on have it shipped to you super

102
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,880
easy

103
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,799
piracy all kinds of piracy every

104
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,500
anything you can you can think of piracy

105
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,810
you can find it assassination and

106
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,270
terrorism part of it as well

107
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,950
and you know of course the worst of the

108
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:30,140
world which is sex offenders six

109
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:33,340
offenders trafficking CB CB stands for

110
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,810
child born for those who are trying to

111
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,429
in the security industry when somebody

112
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,560
says CB means child born child porn is a

113
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:46,540
the law west

114
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:50,650
horrible crime possible if you are a

115
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:53,800
part of an ISP or a Content company that

116
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:56,138
sounds this survey provides a service of

117
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,720
access this is unfortunate but at one

118
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:01,060
point you may come across CP and if you

119
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,120
come across CP make sure that your

120
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,160
company has a policy for accidental

121
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,169
exposure right actually interests for

122
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,460
sure means you're doing your job and

123
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:15,639
both something very horrible you saw

124
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:18,909
when I was at a very large internet

125
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,220
provider we had a policy the policy was

126
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,770
you right now I accidentally suppose

127
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,180
myself to this and you delivered

128
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,409
whatever machine was machine was

129
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:33,100
destroyed that's it they surprised it's

130
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:36,310
a crime to keep those type of a images

131
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,229
or even see them I had several

132
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,900
conversations with with non-furnaces

133
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:45,159
aliens and this is constantly monitored

134
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:47,229
if you're a research eventually it will

135
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,780
be very difficult if you're looking

136
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:52,240
because it's like they force it upon you

137
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,979
right they lie to you and tell you about

138
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,260
things in a forum and then when you go

139
00:07:53,979 --> 00:08:00,880
booth then there's this stuff is very

140
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:02,620
hard to avoid there are a great services

141
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,000
which we partner with by the way that

142
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,860
you should look at if you're doing this

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,169
type of work but make sure you have a

144
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,550
policy for this usually the fancy I

145
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,889
talked to the festivities will tell me

146
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,750
wait you know if you fortunately do your

147
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,700
research work when you're supposed to it

148
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,710
we're not gonna prosecute but if we see

149
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,750
that you are constantly downloading this

150
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,900
stuff or you're watching these videos

151
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,270
then you have a oh yeah most of that

152
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,859
stuff is also a backdoor and they're

153
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,669
constantly in the home for this guys

154
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:33,360
they have become clever as well so

155
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:38,260
here's some of the the hidden services

156
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:42,400

165
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:09,200
advertising then of course illegal

166
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:16,210
pornography and then of course many

167
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:19,520
other illicit and illegal things here's

168
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:22,190
one of the vendors that we were able to

169
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,100
partner with it's called that out in

170
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:28,450
dark owl has index over five hundred

171
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,500
million sites across the entire dark web

172
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,810
the good thing about some of these

173
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,120
services is that they sanitize they just

174
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,319
kept metadata and when I say sanitize

175
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,600
they said you're not going to see the

176
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,050
pictures they don't index pictures at

177
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:48,320
all but they do get the metadata right

178
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:49,760
so some of the the the would like to

179
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,580
thank them because they really helped us

180
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,590
doing this presentation and they allow

181
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:59,720
us to access some of that data in order

182
00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:02,510
to continue to our research so if you

183
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,870
need some sort of a service take a look

184
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:11,720
at them so like I was saying here's an

185
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:14,840
example of the dark web content just

186
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,540
banners who might be a logger

187
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,490
give any mater any of you used to keep

188
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:24,199
any manner through the nineties make

189
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:27,170
banners and so there you go hater was

190
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,350
associated so you put a bunch of gifts

191
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,280
and he would look like an animated gif

192
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,360
so we used to use it all the time so

193
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,670
here's how it looks like it looks like

194
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:44,270
you need low latency plain HTML because

195
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:47,000
the connection is slow the door the the

196
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:50,030
onio browser works by sending you

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,520
through a series of layers right that's

198
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:55,370
what I call it onion lets you some

199
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,890
layers of an animation and usually that

200
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,070
consists of switching IPs and as you

201
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:03,939
switch I

202
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,650
disconnection is an incredibly slow and

203
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,960
because the connections are incredibly

204
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:14,100
slow most of these sites you would not

205
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:16,630
see like flashy or or or or graph heavy

206
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,610
also obviously because a lot of these

207
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,040
guys are criminals I don't think they

208
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:24,089
would have had anybody do flashy stuff

209
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,829
because there will be probably caught

210
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:34,029
right so this is how it looks like

211
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:37,080
here's a we were talking about passwords

212
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:41,620
then this is from a very hot right now

213
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:52,330
here's citizenship for real us vestments

214
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:54,550
Oh put it back there you know and of

215
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:59,560
course we had cleared the currency which

216
00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:05,010
unfortunately is to pick an abler I'm I

217
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:09,300
know many of you here at crypto crypto

218
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:12,339
fanatics are bidding crypto since 20

219
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:16,359
2011 maybe 2012

220
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:19,600
I have friends have bought whoppers for

221
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,550
a tenth of bitcoins like then somebody

222
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,220
gave me for bitcoins more time for

223
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:28,510
bitcoins do the number now do the number

224
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,680
now right and then I bought at $4 enough

225
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,900
what I was going to make a lot of money

226
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,900
so I stole it when it was $16

227
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:43,370
I hope mr. ball right there so I lost a

228
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,310
lot of money right I lost a lot of money

229
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,079
a lot of money and recently when I got

230
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,410
divorced mom I had lost half of my

231
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,569
crypto the lawyer forced me to pretty

232
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,310
much you need to give away half of your

233
00:12:53,569 --> 00:13:02,479
crypto so create those property oh yeah

234
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:04,250
so the cryptocurrencies which is

235
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,790
something very cool and in my opinion

236
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:12,740
something that is inevitable we recently

237
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:15,949
saw the the stable points something will

238
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:18,740
eventually stick it's my baby about with

239
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:20,479
the funds there are there are challenges

240
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,490
with the technology there challenges

241
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,139
obviously with the ecosystem there's too

242
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,089
many criminals

243
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,790
that's it might be the biggest problem

244
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:30,730
the cryptocurrency you see this is for

245
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:35,810
criminals

246
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:37,670
I believe that cryptocurrencies will

247
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,199
eventually become mainstream and we're

248
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:44,660
going to use something crypto and then

249
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:47,089
the cash that fear will go away so the

250
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:51,290
crypto is very popular on the dark web

251
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:55,670
why because he provides a level of

252
00:13:51,290 --> 00:14:01,120
anonymity that is comfortable I don't

253
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:04,099
investigations of crypto when I was that

254
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,459
this internet provider we got

255
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,439
blackmailing extortion all the time and

256
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:13,219
basically what the militia sector will

257
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:16,849
do is send you a an email saying here

258
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:21,019
say hash peace of bed wallet pay where

259
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:23,389
I'm taking you down or like even we'll

260
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,699
say his last dog I got compromise

261
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:28,550
compromise is usually they had something

262
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:30,349
very embarrassing about you or the dog

263
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,139
and I'm saying I got compliment here's

264
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:38,120
the wallet if you don't pay I said I'm

265
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:40,279
publishing and you've seen it also in

266
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,220
mainstream what were naturally madison

267
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:46,220
happened you remember Ashley Madison it

268
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,339
was a cipher cheaters it was popped and

269
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,709
then what they did is they grabbed

270
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:53,269
don't do the dB they didn't even know

271
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:54,800
these people probably you started

272
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:56,449
emailing Denison hey I got your picture

273
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,109
small actually Madison I got your

274
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,880
messages

275
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,529
and here's what you need to pay me or I

276
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,510
will send them to your wife on whatever

277
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:05,689
they may have been so pretexting in some

278
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:07,760
cases this there's this there was some

279
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,449
chatter that there were even suicides

280
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,430
because of this stuff right so that goes

281
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:16,310
back to what Sam was was saying this

282
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:19,040
morning don't trust any of this don't

283
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:34,010
reuse your passwords because you never

284
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:38,930
know you had home base for example we

285
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:43,029
can win by greater right now and many

286
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:47,540
many I'm so nothing takes VDC believe

287
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:53,829
look at one point so usually the biggest

288
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:56,990
expecto courtesy right now as various

289
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:59,439
material I think will prevail I think

290
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:02,959
Bitcoin has reached a point where its

291
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,779
architecture may not escalate while

292
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,510
there are a number of what is called

293
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:11,600
highly or a higher level of anonymity

294
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:14,329
currencies some of the Nazi cash more

295
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,810
narrow and there's more more than the

296
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:23,750
average verge was going to be using

297
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:27,380
hormone by the way and so how they they

298
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:29,389
believe that by using or something I see

299
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,209
we start for cryptocurrency then it will

300
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:34,040
become more popular what happens when I

301
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:37,489
wanted this is changes is there shady

302
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,610
and the they steal crypto from the

303
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,769
current refer very customers I have if

304
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,029
you're on this lack for the the percent

305
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,760
twenty seven slide you will see that

306
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:50,510
there's constantly people complaining

307
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,880
that they said one one quantity but this

308
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,290
another receive then they can't tell

309
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,650
them what happened in the middle I mean

310
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,949
it is an entire

311
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:03,110
that's it's a bracket right so

312
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:06,110
unfortunately the inter currencies are

313
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:09,559
hard to track not really a Bitcoin can

314
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:11,809
give you a one-point certain certainty

315
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:17,209
who used it but there are others that

316
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:19,760
are much more give you a higher level of

317
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,520
anonymity the thing about this though is

318
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,369
that if you see cash or if you use a

319
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,280
verge or if you use more narrow usually

320
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:31,520
you can have to translate into a more

321
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,720
mainstream quit the party so that means

322
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,420
you're gonna have to turn any provider

323
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,970
ethereum or VDC and then cash it out and

324
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,520
that provides you a what I call a choke

325
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,650
point so if you're following the drill

326
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,179
that's usually the highest level

327
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,000
opportunity that you have to catch these

328
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:48,290
people there are other techniques and

329
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,620
there are companies that do that I'm

330
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:56,750
going to do that in a minute

331
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:59,959
so why bitcoin is user market capture so

332
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:02,750
you're the way was the time I checked it

333
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:16,540
I think is tear out the same so because

334
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:19,970
of $6,000 it is higher okay good so this

335
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:24,050
you say another this is 0-3 by the way

336
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:27,740
there's sickroom citroën - and then sick

337
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:29,300
Row 3 and this is Row 3 I haven't

338
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,270
checked us off today they might have

339
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,540
taken it down right but 0 if you must

340
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:37,100
remember it was 8 like a draw

341
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:41,629
assassination or kind of everything goes

342
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:48,559
market then the driver of this is great

343
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:50,480
the courtesy look so unfortunately

344
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,309
cryptocurrency is part of the equation

345
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,170
so if you're looking at this type of

346
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:57,620
stuff you have to look at the trail or

347
00:18:54,170 --> 00:19:01,100
the money create the currency another

348
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,928
example you just remember back page my

349
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,709
page was taken down by patient taking

350
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:05,929
crypto

351
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:10,100
when all the credit card companies

352
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:10,580
canceled by the way I had the fortunate

353
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,199
over

354
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,030
ready to shake the hands of one of those

355
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,840
guys because they used to own the new

356
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:20,030
times media my ex-wife used to work for

357
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,919
the New Times media so I saw that once

358
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,190
in Miami a shook their hands and not

359
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:29,930
just so and recently on I am Jane Doe

360
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:32,750
how they how they were created back page

361
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:35,030
right now I'm gonna give you just a

362
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,480
little tangent would they used to the

363
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:41,420
new tense media it's like a rack like a

364
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:44,360
alternative right so my ex-wife you

365
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:47,690
should tell me the most profitable part

366
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,070
of the paper is the back page in the

367
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,480
back page you don't want the back page

368
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:55,909
was escort perhaps we're talking paper

369
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,680
we're talking paper write paper paper

370
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:01,100
there was no there was no border there

371
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,110
was nothing and I remember she telling

372
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,929
me this guys don't hate the Internet

373
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:08,600
they hate the internet because they want

374
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,670
to sell paper they end up selling

375
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,500
Newton's media I think it was I don't

376
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:16,420
remember who and guess what they did

377
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:19,130
afterwards they created backpage.com

378
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:25,040
it's a little piece of history over this

379
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:26,690
is coming so this along with the back

380
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,899
page actually I think aspire was quite

381
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,810
at one point of the data that was looked

382
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:36,110
upon they go together and unfortunately

383
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:41,750
because they it keeps the the criminals

384
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:44,719
a level of anonymity that is comfortable

385
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:47,090
so why create emergency pretty quick

386
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,040
because it's decentralized because of

387
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:51,500
the pen imbalance because it's not known

388
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,990
the most releases a little unanimity

389
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,550
it's not regulated there are no limits

390
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,440
the number of transactions there's no

391
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,600
limits in quantity

392
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,570
there's no form of tracking and he says

393
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,070
sector worldwide no borders no oversight

394
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:09,340
from government or international

395
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:12,550
organizations so human traffickers use

396
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,770
cryptocurrency to avoid prosecution

397
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:20,418
the clear dead surface web is showing

398
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:22,759
rigorous payment form like we dog use

399
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:26,690
justice took this stuff too long ago

400
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:29,899
this is an escort side where it says

401
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:32,539
right there BTC actually takes you the

402
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:38,689
Bitcoin now taken and had bubbles which

403
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:42,169
is the business they also use things

404
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:43,909
called mixers mixers basically you set

405
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:46,850
the quantity and then they start senator

406
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:48,950
will double wallets that way you can

407
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,449
trace them so they send into multiple

408
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,460
wallets and eventually gets to a point

409
00:21:50,450 --> 00:22:03,470
there are ways to discover that by the

410
00:21:52,460 --> 00:22:05,929
way and I think we had a a we also have

411
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:08,899
any partner and a person a percent that

412
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:11,059
here today and sorry of this conference

413
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:14,570
did you speak to fan Victor fan is the

414
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:16,999
CEO of a and chain there are ways to

415
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:20,389
track and keep the cryptocurrency there

416
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:25,850
are ways of tracking origin and

417
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:29,149
destination and providing attribution I

418
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:32,269
think you hear great okay yeah there you

419
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:34,449
go so there are two one of them is I

420
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:37,369
forgot the name of the other company

421
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,999
chain analysis which is mostly bit

422
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:43,850
easier than his which does a BTC n

423
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:46,609
ethereum so there are there are efforts

424
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:51,678
on there in the blockchain as security

425
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:56,149
to prevent this so here's the switching

426
00:22:51,679 --> 00:23:00,109
a little bit of why this is a huge

427
00:22:56,149 --> 00:23:04,488
problem this is a market of a hundred

428
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:07,340
and fifty billion per year as human

429
00:23:04,489 --> 00:23:09,799
trafficking at any given time in 2016

430
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,799
there was an estimated or forty million

431
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,840
people in more than slavery

432
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,970
including twenty four point nine million

433
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,769
the forced labor and fifty point four

434
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,769
billion in forced marriage

435
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:27,999
commercial sexual exploitation accounts

436
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:30,199
for ninety nine billion of that dog

437
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:33,680
traffickers are driven by the level

438
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,660
anonymity destroy the dark

439
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,380
and what with the corns it's like those

440
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:42,050
are like some of the biggest ingredients

441
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,400
our water better usually comes out in

442
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,100
the surface because a lot of the

443
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:49,130
consumers on this dog I'm not

444
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:53,120
technically savvy so they have me they

445
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:56,510
did to use the the surface the clear day

446
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,850
by things like Craigslist for example

447
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:01,129
but greatness is I would say it's the

448
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,379
tip of the iceberg versus there's an

449
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:08,050
entire organization and logistics that

450
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:18,500
confident that a lot of it happens is

451
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:20,240
anything the DARPA well it's definitely

452
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:25,670
from third world countries I would be

453
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:27,800
able to land

454
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,420
Macario Vegas were there on the size of

455
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,430
the bathroom this is if you are

456
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:34,400
kidnapped or you'reyou're being trapped

457
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,660
over you being a victim of sexual abuse

458
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,490
please call this number

459
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:43,090
have you ever seen it yeah Vegas as soon

460
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:46,790
as you want I thought that was a density

461
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:49,220
in the bathrooms for female and Mel's

462
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,200
there there are taxes and if you if you

463
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,700
believe you are being the victim was

464
00:24:51,200 --> 00:25:01,420
sexual trafficking police call this

465
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:01,420
number now Vienna has longer new hands

466
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:07,400
so like I said before what you see in

467
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,990
the clear that is a tip of the iceberg

468
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:14,870
versus theirs so the entire operation

469
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:22,940
with that much money so here's some some

470
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:24,500
of the the flows on tracking quick

471
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,780
temper see oh there it is

472
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,910
chain analysis and a a chain and chain

473
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:32,300
we have Victor if you have asking

474
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:34,250
questions we can also use machine

475
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,260
learning and data driven methods which

476
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,180
you are about to see basically what

477
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,940
we're looking for is banners

478
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:44,150
established entities identify was a

479
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,530
producer who's a consumer I started the

480
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,900
flow of

481
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,309
Communications may give us almost

482
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,890
sometimes and look at it like when

483
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:54,049
you're looking at flow traffic when you

484
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:57,250
have SSL you can see what is it it but

485
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:59,450
you can tell if you if you if you

486
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:04,730
analysis into it that something is going

487
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:07,070
on we also use obviously services that

488
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:11,450
can do is greatly monitoring indexing or

489
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:12,830
labeling labeling is very important you

490
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:16,549
can do this on your own there are

491
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:20,030
there's gold out there that will code

492
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:33,220
that will allow you to scrape the the

493
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:35,960
dark way not easy though yeah yes

494
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:39,620
vonda's and stuff like that but the the

495
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,780
the dark web is mostly for logistics in

496
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,049
operation the real details will come

497
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:47,780
from clear name because you need

498
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:50,840
bandwidth there are usually two types of

499
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:53,090
Dinos layer three layer seven so it's

500
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,030
either volumetric volumetric is a fill

501
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:59,809
up the pipe so nobody can look at your

502
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:02,450
side and application that your seven is

503
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:05,539
you know I'm just gonna download this

504
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:08,570
PDF ten thousand times your server

505
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:12,289
aventuras SI can server anymore what's

506
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:14,240
up so at least football you metrics I

507
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:16,940
would say I can tell you this because we

508
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,210
used to have we call the brown list the

509
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:23,990
brown does it was a list of tournaments

510
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:27,830
so anything anything that will even come

511
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:29,450
from door it was block was did not of

512
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:33,260
course we were adidas for either right

513
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:38,960
I'm not sure any entity can lock it or

514
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:40,879
not but you're correct so here's some of

515
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,970
the you were asking me I'm right about

516
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,320
this low so here's a you can find this

517
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,830
by the way in the human trafficking

518
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,580
report you can find that here

519
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:54,310
that for this so we didn't obviously

520
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,830
when I repeat the their report we do

521
00:27:54,310 --> 00:28:01,540
some of it and here's the some of the

522
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:11,250
flow as you can see is third-world right

523
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:14,409
so Saharan Africa Asia South America so

524
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:18,570
I'm gonna let Jim jump on this and speak

525
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,570
about the data dreamy security emilynics

526
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,940
yeah and just to kind of touch on your

527
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,679
question a little bit more I think what

528
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,690
was sort of surprising for us to find

529
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,170
out about kind of doing this research is

530
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:37,150
that like you know we have the slide

531
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,070
hidden so you won't build a CDS but

532
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,120
basically like there are some graphics

533
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,220
we're kind of playing with that one

534
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,260
point I just derived from this 2016

535
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:47,610
recording it kind of goes into the

536
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:50,770
statistics of what like where like where

537
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:52,780
the different regions like what like you

538
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,060
know where the motivating factors are in

539
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:57,399
what the distribution of people involved

540
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,710
in in different forms of human

541
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,190
trafficking like how they're related to

542
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:05,440
sort of the geography of the region and

543
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,880
it turns out like some in the Caribbean

544
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,680
and some of these sort of their world

545
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,710
places there's there's really crazy

546
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,600
things I never even knew about like

547
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,610
human like victims of human trafficking

548
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,350
are used for organ harvesting for

549
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,540
instance but but it turns out in the

550
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:21,790
States and in Canada in first world

551
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:26,080
countries or where there's the most

552
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:29,740
money these are very prevalent places

553
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,379
where forced marriage and sex

554
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,570
trafficking happens so like like the sex

555
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,580
laughing doesn't always happen in the

556
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:39,700
third world where you think because it's

557
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,590
more profitable to move victims around

558
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,630
and sell them to people who have the

559
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,610
most wealth so the first world is really

560
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,380
like more involved in this than I

561
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,090
originally kind of assumed out it will

562
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,520
start kind of giving it in the data and

563
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,310
that was kind of one that the shocking

564
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,900
things is just learning about this from

565
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:59,830
kind of a research and statistics

566
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:01,180
perspective and and and kind of now

567
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:03,250
we'll just kind of get into some of the

568
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:07,180
use cases of like what research kind of

569
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:09,280
did to help with a hackathon initially

570
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,530
and then volunteer kind of just over

571
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,810
over the years on different problems

572
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,670
related to this broad topic so this is

573
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,409
this is totally just volunteer projects

574
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,570
there's there's not a commercial

575
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,340
incentive here and and one of the lucky

576
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,470
things for us is it rotted me and been

577
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,500
part of companies that are just kind of

578
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,450
have a you know enough maturity and are

579
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,420
part of these these bigger Silicon

580
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:34,120
Valley and technological conglomerates

581
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,970
that are kind of helping interact with

582
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,379
NGOs law enforcement the force first one

583
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,180
we did was this it's called the Facebook

584
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,250
Child Safety Agathon it takes place

585
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,140
every year at Facebook and we basically

586
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,020
sat down with a bunch of guys from a

587
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:49,240
company called thorn and they gave us a

588
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,889
data set that was fished by the FBI in

589
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,390
collaboration with Orton will kind of

590
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,130
talk a little bit about with that the

591
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:58,240
nature of that data but there's there's

592
00:30:54,130 --> 00:31:02,050
tons of places that are I mean a mix of

593
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,930
government industry and and and in

594
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:06,639
places all over Silicon Valley

595
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:10,570
particularly we work with Splunk

596
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,520
Facebook uber Amazon and here's sort of

597
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,870
the NGOs that have kind of over over the

598
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,760
years come into our lives and and

599
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,100
there's some real fascinating people in

600
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,800
the mixture or orphan secure is a group

601
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,600
of like ex-navy seals and FBI guys who

602
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,820
will who will kick cool kicked doors

603
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:28,600
down and rescue kids from extreme

604
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:30,490
circumstances and just just you know

605
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,909
it's just a story that kind of resonated

606
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:36,670
with us you know Rodney got really good

607
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:38,770
at hunting malware and digital threat

608
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,300
actors at night and I think this this

609
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:44,470
just just has a little bit more of a

610
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,940
serious tone when you when you find when

611
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,940
you when you help law enforcement kind

612
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,920
of prosecute someone who's who's who's

613
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,660
putting a child at risk it just it just

614
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,870
kinda has a different way than catching

615
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:58,420
a computer virus I think kind of one of

616
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,949
the things that is sort of was just kind

617
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:03,670
of interesting for me to learn about

618
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:06,850
this problem is is

619
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:10,720
kind of theme that there's there's

620
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:12,939
certain kind of like issues and and just

621
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,620
research problems that will kind of

622
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:21,100
manifest in society and these problems

623
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:23,620
are not that there's not an incentive

624
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,909
for commercial organizations or industry

625
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,520
to solve these problems there's no

626
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:30,840
financial incentive and and they they

627
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,830
also kind of are not at the scale of

628
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,419
something that the government can spend

629
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,760
a lot of money on and it turns out like

630
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,980
human trafficking in the states as this

631
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,040
falls in this sort of weird kind of gray

632
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,600
area where there's some local spend but

633
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,639
at the government level the government's

634
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,100
more carries about spending money

635
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,600
against the war on terrorism I'm sort of

636
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,209
problems that have like a little bit

637
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,889
different of a geopolitical scale and so

638
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:57,280
we kind of found human trafficking at

639
00:32:53,890 --> 00:33:00,040
this as a sort of gray area where it's

640
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,770
just a there's really needs to be a call

641
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,810
to arms and kind of a grassroots sort of

642
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:07,389
volunteer movement to kind of help get

643
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:09,129
get some of the the work done here so

644
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,200
that's kind of where where where we're

645
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:14,020
at it's it's there's a lot of

646
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,000
interesting problems here but but what

647
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,620
there's no one that that is going to be

648
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,030
working on them unless unless in sort of

649
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,889
the community and so that's kind of

650
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,570
where one of one of the the selfish

651
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:25,600
regions to even do this talk is just to

652
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:27,760
kind of tell some more stories and say

653
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,649
like every single person in this room

654
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,720
could probably contribute in some way

655
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:34,990
you know a few hours on the weekend and

656
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:37,210
just hacking using skills that not only

657
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,330
just computer security but a variety of

658
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:43,360
different different disciplines come

659
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:45,850
into play and like I mean here here's

660
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,740
kind of like thorns page these data

661
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,020
scientists researchers technology

662
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,120
providers partner organizations like all

663
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,740
these are certain NGOs we work with that

664
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,649
apps are a different kind of channels

665
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,900
for of all volunteering and and some of

666
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:01,990
the stuff is like is really fascinating

667
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,810
when it comes to just like the the type

668
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:06,400
of like like technological problems that

669
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,560
these companies are interested in

670
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,659
solving so if you're interested you know

671
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,219
just like take a lot of this you know

672
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,139
paying us for the debt or come talk

673
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:15,969
afterward but we got all kinds of links

674
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:18,429
and resources we can throw your ways if

675
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:19,810
your kind of you know just just want to

676
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:24,179
understand how you can help more on this

677
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:26,290
problem and like one of the one of the

678
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:29,230
just another sort of like kind of

679
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:31,659
statistic that that kind of for me Cyril

680
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,250
was like really the first time I was

681
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:35,440
starting to think wow like this this

682
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:38,679
this problem affects way closer to home

683
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,149
I originally thought like like human

684
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,399
trafficking would take place in the

685
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:48,759
third world but this is a this is the

686
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:50,710
output of of form thorns technological

687
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,320
project that's called spotlight and it

688
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,060
helps sort of enable law enforcement to

689
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,000
kind of take action on most most

690
00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:00,730
prosecutable cases and just I think this

691
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,010
was in one year of time these are the

692
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:07,660
number of prosecuting cases per state

693
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,550
involving my child sex trafficking and I

694
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,170
mean where California there's four

695
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,750
thousand cases of this in California

696
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,520
alone and just I mean it just it's close

697
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,320
to the home and it's it's it's crazy to

698
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,599
think the scale these things really

699
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:25,450
happen on so what I like like kind of

700
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,660
just just spending time on this problem

701
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:30,279
just from a pure research perspective is

702
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:34,810
there's there's a ton of different kind

703
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:40,180
of challenges and sort of leading edge

704
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:44,790
kind of techniques that can kind of come

705
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:47,529
in and play a part in helping create a

706
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:52,599
prosecutable evidence for taking action

707
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:54,609
against someone who's who's putting like

708
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:56,920
CP on the internet and taking pictures

709
00:35:54,609 --> 00:36:00,970
of kids or or just just doing any of

710
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:04,030
this kind of crazy stuff and just kind

711
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:06,790
of maybe Tintin and grab a couple of the

712
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:09,339
best projects I think one of the

713
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:13,210
interesting things we'll talk about a

714
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:17,560
little bit is the need to sort of

715
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:21,220
triangulate and find as much context out

716
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:24,440
of an image as possible in order to tell

717
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:26,959
law enforcement this is the possible

718
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,480
geolocation art this is the possible

719
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,880
area where where this picture was taken

720
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,190
and this is where where a kid can be you

721
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,680
know so one of the things that helps a

722
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,420
lot is background images and pictures

723
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,089
that are scraped off with dark web in

724
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,980
this in this context so what will happen

725
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:45,619
is these NGOs will scrape all these all

726
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,079
these images and then and then this

727
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:50,359
application for instance is all about

728
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,900
correlating the background image in

729
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:56,119
hopes of telling us like what like what

730
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,789
a hotel chain was this picture taking in

731
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:00,230
in in like Interpol an international

732
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:02,180
police investigation it's like one of

733
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:05,180
the first things they'll do if they have

734
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:09,710
a set of digital evidence that's like CP

735
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:14,269
and and and just just images of children

736
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:16,819
and crazy kind of like examples they're

737
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:18,200
gonna like the the operators who are

738
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,779
kind of sifting through that evidence

739
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,299
are gonna look at things like the

740
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:25,099
electrical outlet in the background of

741
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:26,960
the picture to do the first layer of

742
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,609
triangle is a ssin and just say like

743
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,769
once they see an electrical outlet

744
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:32,328
Interpol can usually triangulate that to

745
00:37:30,769 --> 00:37:35,450
a country and so these are sort of that

746
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:38,150
the basic kind of levels of context and

747
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:40,609
layers of context that over time human

748
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:44,329
operators kind of do manually just just

749
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:46,190
with by by hand and here's where sort of

750
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,539
like machine learning and some of these

751
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,180
techniques kind of come in to

752
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:53,480
automatically sort of add the context

753
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:56,890
that a human operator would do would

754
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,890
just do what they're trying to make it I

755
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,550
[Music]

756
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:09,009
you know being advocated effectively do

757
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:10,990
that without like exposing their own

758
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:15,220
computer to porn and then getting busted

759
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:19,209
potentially by some FBI that's actually

760
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:20,680
monitor that happens along with any type

761
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:25,539
of research there's been many times

762
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:29,379
where not would images like a certain

763
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:31,480
audience you know they get a call for

764
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:35,140
example say hey and know this activity

765
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:37,990
and this no can you please get out right

766
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:39,910
so that may happen by many many times

767
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,950
law enforcement does not tell you home

768
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:46,629
never tell you even government would

769
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:48,788
never tell you whether that I so like I

770
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:51,430
said before Holly you not get prosecuted

771
00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:54,400
well are you downloading all that stuff

772
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:56,078
let's go over your business are you

773
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,569
looking at it too and then define it or

774
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,510
that's different right they know they

775
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:03,520
know badness they know they they sort of

776
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,980
determine the behavior they compulsive

777
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,380
person many times this chocolate those

778
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:11,140
are compulsive but what it means they

779
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,960
keep repeating repeating repeating so so

780
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,480
there's a pattern of constantly grabbing

781
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,609
images and downloading and they can see

782
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,660
it because you ever if you're a reserved

783
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:22,420
they have dominant if you're a

784
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:25,058
researcher we can we can tell by what

785
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:28,539
you're doing but obviously if you show a

786
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:32,829
pattern right on that you are actually

787
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:34,450
looking at idea yeah then then they can

788
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:37,390
use them all anytime the project do you

789
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:40,930
by the way it has nothing to do with job

790
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:43,750
or dies hey we have a person that was

791
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:47,828
driven into suicide because he wrote a

792
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:50,079
script that downloaded PDFs that person

793
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:57,059
was artists work but he was prosecuted

794
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:57,059
for it so yes you didn't buy anything

795
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,800
yeah what's this we can love it yeah

796
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:05,649
yeah sorry

797
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,670
no no choice you know this is and that's

798
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,070
like that's actually a good question

799
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:10,330
that would kind of lead in to some of

800
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,670
the machine learning techniques we're

801
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:14,620
gonna use because I mean there's just

802
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,920
different like best practices in these

803
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:19,450
an extreme content like so one of the

804
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,180
things we're gonna talk about a little

805
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,939
bit is hashing images so when we when we

806
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:26,740
like like what will happen usually in

807
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,150
these kind of collaborations like the

808
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,790
one rod it'd be worked on is a

809
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,980
collaboration between the FBI and NGO

810
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,800
and researchers and so there's already

811
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,030
kind of the blessing of the FBI

812
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,930
basically what they had to do was they

813
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:44,680
the FBI was tracking a forum that's

814
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:47,290
known like extreme content for mainly

815
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,480
focused on my child pornography and what

816
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:52,690
they did was they they had to pretend

817
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,400
they were like like a user that means an

818
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,350
account a tagging invite so they had to

819
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,140
prove they had content of their own so

820
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:01,960
the FBI already kind of created like a

821
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,549
fish got an account there and then and

822
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,250
then they gave the creds to the NGO

823
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,510
which set up which set up a scraper and

824
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,890
that's where we kind of started will

825
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,020
kind of get into that data set we have

826
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,150
six months of forum posts from all

827
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:15,220
people on this private fish forum and

828
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,810
and kind of there's there's just like

829
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,399
when you kind of work in collaboration

830
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,680
with law enforcement stuff they'll be

831
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,320
you know they'll just be different rules

832
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:26,470
of engagement in this case I think the

833
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,650
data set they gave us all the images

834
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:31,870
will just remove entirely you know as a

835
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:34,780
pre-processing step other Kate other

836
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:36,940
cases still do they'll basically give us

837
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,950
a half so it's not actually image it's

838
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,150
like a string representing the image and

839
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:42,009
then it will do different things like

840
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,230
we'll talk about how we use these hashes

841
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,820
in a few minutes but but it's kind of

842
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,100
like a case-by-case basis in our

843
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:50,100
experience of sort of how it's more like

844
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,960
how the collaboration is manifesting

845
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,339
and sometimes there's like it's like

846
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,140
that the data said they gave us they

847
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,580
just handed it to us and now we have six

848
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,379
months of day everything you know

849
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,960
there's no there's no like contract or

850
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,130
anything but I I was talking to a a law

851
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,350
enforcement official and they were

852
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,520
saying you know as researchers kind of

853
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,290
like what rod said you know it's just

854
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,360
they're almost it's almost like they

855
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,860
recognize like they're you know who the

856
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,060
white hats are where the black hats are

857
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:16,110
in this case a little bit more because

858
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,730
there's definitely gray areas but but I

859
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,290
think one of the things I abused person

860
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,080
leaves these hashing techniques which

861
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:23,850
I'll show you in a second and just kind

862
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,310
of like you know we have a couple bus

863
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:28,710
words thrown in these slides what we're

864
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:33,080
sort of talking about some of the key

865
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:36,180
kind of like kind of the tactical use

866
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:39,540
cases that we really sort of try to find

867
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,450
a good use of kind of modern bleeding

868
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,190
answer machine learning techniques is

869
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,359
around image and text recognition and

870
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:49,380
this is really where kind of deep

871
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:51,240
learning shines sort of as a as a great

872
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,950
kind of example of some of the

873
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,540
breakthroughs in these these algorithms

874
00:42:52,950 --> 00:43:00,180
we hear a lot about in the news but the

875
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:02,670
surge is some real kind of quick just

876
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,200
sketch of sort of the difference between

877
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:07,020
some of these buzzwords but I think at a

878
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,270
high level we took this from like a blog

879
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:11,910
post from our company at a high level

880
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,160
like we talked philosophically about

881
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:17,279
building you know conscious machines

882
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,410
building intelligent artificial systems

883
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,960
this is sort of the broader kind of

884
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,549
science and buzzwords around artificial

885
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,950
intelligence this can me know what quite

886
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:27,360
a bit a different sort of philosophy and

887
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:29,850
what does it mean to make a computer

888
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,620
conscious like you sort of kind of come

889
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:34,380
at the highest level of certain ease

890
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:36,180
these artificial intelligence theories

891
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,650
and then it's kind of statistical

892
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,379
learning or statistical machine learning

893
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:42,870
or XI learning for sure sort is more

894
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,160
about kind of a subset of the theory of

895
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,740
artificial intelligence that's really

896
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,370
about tools and techniques that are

897
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:51,390
meant for pattern recognition and

898
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:52,680
machine learning there's a lot of

899
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,779
different tools and techniques we can

900
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,430
use you may have used some that you

901
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,020
didn't even know like like doing a

902
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:59,080
statistical regression using a

903
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,500
regression and

904
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:05,470
in Excel is an example of statistical

905
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,780
learning but there's there's sort of

906
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,609
like there's there's sort of different

907
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,900
use cases for different kind of reasons

908
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:13,570
why you'll use a particular machine

909
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,540
learning algorithm and it turns out in

910
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:18,670
in the last decade or so there's been

911
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,040
some very big breakthroughs and these

912
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,080
types of algorithms that are referred to

913
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,080
neural network algorithms or deep

914
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:29,620
learning in particular and deep learning

915
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,630
just kind of is a buzzword but it's it's

916
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:34,390
a puzzle it's a buzzword that has some

917
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:37,180
weight behind it because one of the the

918
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:39,009
reasons why it's so powerful is it's the

919
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,350
deep learning methods particularly

920
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:44,110
around image classification which we'll

921
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:46,029
talk about and and and text translation

922
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:48,010
and natural and this processing these

923
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:49,570
these are these are kind of

924
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,550
state-of-the-art in the sense that they

925
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:53,560
meet all other known algorithms in the

926
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,570
literature from an accuracy and metrics

927
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,240
perspective so it's kind of like best

928
00:44:55,570 --> 00:45:01,420
practices that let me choose deep

929
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,799
learning for for some of the some of the

930
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,900
use cases we'll talk about here mainly

931
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,550
like image and some of the kinds of

932
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,380
post-processing we'll talk about a

933
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,480
little architecture and kind of where we

934
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,520
where we kind of tackle the the image

935
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,160
recognition stuff and I think for me

936
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,620
personally as a data scientist over the

937
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,170
last few years what I kind of went when

938
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:23,980
I would work on like this is some github

939
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:26,230
code we had on a project that that is

940
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:30,160
about detecting the delivery of exploits

941
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:32,950
an HTTP traffic and this is all kind of

942
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,750
code that we wrote myself kind of data

943
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,520
rod was generating showing the data

944
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,980
scientists this is how I'm delivering a

945
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,570
payload this is what the statistics for

946
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,310
the payload looked like when we're when

947
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,660
we're running an export kit and a bunch

948
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:45,040
of other things and it turns out like

949
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,140
when you spend enough time looking at

950
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,870
all these all these data sets you get up

951
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:51,490
you get some ideas for statistics or at

952
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:53,529
data scientists would call these things

953
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:56,379
each line of these things you slime here

954
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:58,150
sort of a feature very statistic row or

955
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:00,420
column we're adding that's kind of

956
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:03,790
giving us extra context or dimension

957
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:06,130
around a particular like set an HTTP

958
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:07,020
request so this is something I wrote by

959
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,880
hand

960
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,470
just overtime learn learning and it's

961
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,230
called FIFA feature engineering or a

962
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:16,399
feature design part of kind of building

963
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:19,050
a machine learning algorithm and another

964
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,450
thing I've seen changing my job using

965
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:24,300
deep learning techniques is is nowadays

966
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:25,740
I don't I don't even get to this step

967
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,190
where I'm kind of thinking about a bunch

968
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,629
of different statistics or features the

969
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,220
deep learning algorithm is going to

970
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,750
figure that out itself so this is

971
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,640
sometimes called like automated feature

972
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,470
learning and it's just the nature of

973
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,629
these these learning architectures and

974
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:41,459
these algorithms in particular that let

975
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:45,450
us sort of bypass one of the more

976
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:48,780
traditional kind of parts of the

977
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:51,029
development lifecycle in in in kind of a

978
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:53,100
classic data science so so another

979
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:54,930
reason that deep learning is becoming

980
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,940
very powerful especially if you have a

981
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:00,000
lot of compute like something like a

982
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,860
company like Google or Amazon is that

983
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,700
they just run they just have so much

984
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:08,190
compute and so much like like processing

985
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:10,220
power that they can just run run data

986
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:13,140
through this algorithm and over time

987
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:15,390
this kind of thing that humans will be

988
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,430
sort of like sort of teasing out by hand

989
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,980
is gonna be automatically learned by the

990
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:22,919
algorithm that's kind of like a so this

991
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:25,100
varies to a high level of kind of

992
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,260
approximation a lot of kind of

993
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,730
complicated topics but just come talk

994
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,100
this afterward if you want some some

995
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:33,960
kind of references and Isis doesn't

996
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,730
really do the deep learning conversation

997
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:41,910
justice but it's just just kind of quick

998
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:44,640
quick overview no no just kind of get

999
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:46,350
into our model a little like so so kind

1000
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,670
of going back to this these are this

1001
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:54,600
data set that is basically forum posts

1002
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:57,420
it's like it looks like like a aegis

1003
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,220
anonymous anonymized warm posts and and

1004
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,590
what happens in these these forum posts

1005
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:03,750
because we were having about six months

1006
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:06,930
of communication through this community

1007
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:08,730
that the majority of the people

1008
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:11,430
participating in the community in the

1009
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:13,670
forum are content consumers they just

1010
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,019
they just they go on every day and they

1011
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:16,460
they're looking for crazy pictures

1012
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:18,288
they're not we're not putting anyone out

1013
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:22,339
there they're just they're basically

1014
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:23,630
consuming the content and and and then

1015
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:25,190
there's there's some other parts this

1016
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,599
community that are kind of like auxilary

1017
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:28,250
that if there's like admin and

1018
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:30,289
counselors there's some other people

1019
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,359
that just don't interact just kind of

1020
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:34,549
dead accounts but kind of the things

1021
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:39,680
that what law enforcement was really

1022
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:42,410
kind of interested in is is the people

1023
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,029
that produce the content and that's a

1024
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:45,649
very small subset of this community now

1025
00:48:44,029 --> 00:48:47,900
those are the kind of people that were

1026
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:49,970
sort of building a model around to help

1027
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,760
sort of triangulate and add as much

1028
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:55,669
context and to kind of work what they're

1029
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,799
up to and this so I thought this is the

1030
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:00,019
picture the the forum post

1031
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:04,130
so we basically this is actually a

1032
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:05,629
picture we use in in a sort of a

1033
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:07,970
different problem for kind of a

1034
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:11,720
corporate modeling problem so we would

1035
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:15,799
really model the behavior of different

1036
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:18,558
types of enterprise survey enterprise

1037
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:20,569
like directory in terms of like these

1038
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,490
hypothesis like we got end-users we've

1039
00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:24,558
got backup accounts for that admins kind

1040
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:27,319
of have the Sabbath assist on to the

1041
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,049
nature of the users and we use some very

1042
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:31,730
similar techniques that will describe

1043
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:34,099
kind of for this this dark web problem

1044
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:37,099
also the model kind of just the

1045
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:39,049
different types of users in in like

1046
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,460
enterprise Active Directory and so

1047
00:49:39,049 --> 00:49:42,500
that's where some kind of some from a

1048
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:44,089
research perspective some of these kind

1049
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,220
of when you work on one problem you'll

1050
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:47,690
see sort of analogues of parallels and

1051
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:50,779
so we've kind of gone back and forth

1052
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:53,180
from the dark web to kind of just model

1053
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:55,819
we held updated we've even used this to

1054
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:58,368
sort of apply different kind of group

1055
00:49:55,819 --> 00:50:00,859
group kind of hierarchies to how people

1056
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:02,839
write scripts and in enterprise you can

1057
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:05,299
kind of find pop malicious PowerShell

1058
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:10,630
scripts by sort of modeling kind of what

1059
00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:15,650
is typical for your group of admins I

1060
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:17,940
think some references for for some of

1061
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:22,319
the different problems we're kind of a

1062
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:24,270
exposing him and I think like that the

1063
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,759
hash value stuff is something that I

1064
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:27,960
really serve them passionate about it

1065
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,480
will kind of walk you through some these

1066
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,849
these different examples of how how

1067
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:37,859
hashing is used in general an image

1068
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:40,109
detection - it's really kind of like to

1069
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:43,170
help accelerate the problem of pattern

1070
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:45,720
matching images with computers so kind

1071
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:48,240
of who's kind of the start of it all so

1072
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,730
this is this is basically like they

1073
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,950
stopped like a paper kind like we have

1074
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:57,750
some statistical hypothesis that were

1075
00:50:52,950 --> 00:51:02,098
we're sort of overlaying on six months

1076
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:04,619
of form interactions and the hypothesis

1077
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:06,990
is that there's gonna be a few people in

1078
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:09,359
this form data that are of extreme

1079
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:11,910
importance are the VIPs that we really

1080
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:14,250
want to target get as much context as

1081
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:16,319
possible and also kind of hope there's

1082
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:18,390
some operational security failures in

1083
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,400
their community communications so that's

1084
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:22,618
kind of like justjust just looking for

1085
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,210
the low-hanging fruit is like what did

1086
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:26,760
someone actually like put an email

1087
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:28,410
address and one of the chats today did

1088
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,270
they put sort of identifiable

1089
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:32,970
information and there's any way to do

1090
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:37,680
attribution given the fact that we know

1091
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:41,640
that the IPS are the key things that we

1092
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:44,790
kind of use for this this sort of this

1093
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:48,029
type of model is basically taking the

1094
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:50,279
text data and and turning it into a

1095
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:52,650
social graph kind of like how you look

1096
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,540
at Facebook or Twitter Instagram how how

1097
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:56,339
any of those sort of analytic engines

1098
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,349
look at their own data under the hood

1099
00:51:56,339 --> 00:52:00,990
the first step is really to create a

1100
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:03,960
graph of all the interactions in a way

1101
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:05,910
that is meaningful to do things like how

1102
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,880
do I rank the most important node in my

1103
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:11,009
graph how do I tech tell where are the

1104
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,290
connected components and just different

1105
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:15,480
kinds of concepts that really sort of

1106
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:17,279
our a borrowed from sort of classic

1107
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,500
graph theory in computer science

1108
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,089
so one thing we use a lot and this kind

1109
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,940
of problem is something called pay track

1110
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:24,869
it's just a sort of a technique that

1111
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,920
Google

1112
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:30,630
pioneer to sort of take a graph of stuff

1113
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,579
and say like what is the most important

1114
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:34,740
note in the graph it could be a it could

1115
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:36,900
be a graph of the enterprise connections

1116
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:41,368
in Active Directory it can be a graph of

1117
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:45,359
in our case we make the graph by every

1118
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:48,809
every every username in the forum it is

1119
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,940
a node and every app mentioned so users

1120
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:53,009
at each other in this form and so every

1121
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:56,160
app mention is an edge to another user

1122
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:59,160
and then over time we can basically kind

1123
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,440
of use different techniques some of them

1124
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:03,749
are graph algorithms some of them are

1125
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,450
belong to something we call national

1126
00:53:03,749 --> 00:53:08,308
language processing and then the final

1127
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:10,410
kind of little piece of the the

1128
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:12,119
algorithm is is is the image detection

1129
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:15,660
algorithm which is specific to deep

1130
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:17,759
learning the key kind of assumption we

1131
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:19,980
make here is that form interactions are

1132
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:21,450
tightly linked to specific subgroups of

1133
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,160
the population and that's kind of I

1134
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:26,930
meant there's there's a few VIPs that

1135
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:30,328
are basically producing the content here

1136
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:31,799
the the actual algorithm and we kind of

1137
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:33,539
list out the steps here it's kind of

1138
00:53:31,799 --> 00:53:35,430
like boring details but we're basically

1139
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:39,410
like we take this raw data in the form

1140
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:41,879
the foremost and we build a graph of

1141
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:43,799
basically nodes and edges using quick

1142
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,589
sort of this rule add mentions or our

1143
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:48,749
edges and user names or nodes and then

1144
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:50,730
we do a couple other techniques I think

1145
00:53:48,749 --> 00:53:52,890
there's a lot to sort of each algorithm

1146
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:55,019
that's kind of a basically listed in

1147
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:56,339
this step but the next thing is just

1148
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:58,950
sort of about natural language

1149
00:53:56,339 --> 00:54:05,009
processing and what happens is when you

1150
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:06,749
kind of create a like like you basically

1151
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:08,880
are able to aggregate all the

1152
00:54:06,749 --> 00:54:11,669
information for a single user name and

1153
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:16,739
you can you could call this the user

1154
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:18,920
sort of full kind of like we would call

1155
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:20,569
it a document in this in this language

1156
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,640
because it sort of fits into this thing

1157
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:25,190
we call topic model but we basically

1158
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,170
treat each user's full kind of

1159
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:29,750
interactions and all the text they use

1160
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:31,400
on the form as a single document and

1161
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:34,099
then we have to do a couple of things

1162
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,900
that are sort of calm like like just

1163
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:38,119
just little tricks and natural language

1164
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,190
processing to like removes like words

1165
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:41,990
that aren't important like or the it's

1166
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:44,390
called like stemming and a couple other

1167
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:46,970
tricks that basically reduce the the

1168
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:48,500
vocabulary of the space down is

1169
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:51,470
something that small enough dimension

1170
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:54,769
that makes makes that the the model kind

1171
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:56,180
of meaningful and so what what happens

1172
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:58,339
that the second step is this thing

1173
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:00,470
called a top account and the reason we

1174
00:54:58,339 --> 00:55:01,819
kind of ever doing that is is we're sort

1175
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:04,660
of like building two things in parallel

1176
00:55:01,819 --> 00:55:07,250
or buildings for this NLP picture of

1177
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:08,450
individual users communications and then

1178
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,819
we're also seeing like those

1179
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:13,730
communications in a broader social graph

1180
00:55:10,819 --> 00:55:15,109
and NLP stuff comes in really important

1181
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,779
before they're operational security

1182
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:19,848
fails so when we sort of like reduces

1183
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:23,119
and throw away all the crud and get rid

1184
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:25,190
of all the stop words like at the is her

1185
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,589
and we can kind of start seeing like

1186
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:29,599
little interesting artifacts and and if

1187
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:33,109
one of the VIP accounts in particular

1188
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,750
have a set of had a sort of a vocabulary

1189
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:37,279
that is interesting enough for law

1190
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:42,890
enforcement to kind of correlate

1191
00:55:37,279 --> 00:55:44,869
evidence to the final steps in this

1192
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:46,788
stuff like some of these things are kind

1193
00:55:44,869 --> 00:55:48,349
of in this isn't really like a linear of

1194
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:52,279
step so these things are happening in

1195
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:53,690
parallel but we have a graph so what do

1196
00:55:52,279 --> 00:55:55,400
we do with the graph is build some

1197
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:58,279
metrics on that that's that's what we

1198
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,140
page rank is page rank is basically

1199
00:55:58,279 --> 00:56:01,789
going to take every single person or

1200
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,470
every single node in that graph and it's

1201
00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:05,359
going to give us a ranking so I can say

1202
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:07,669
like what is the most important wrapping

1203
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:10,609
in their psyche what is important note

1204
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:13,250
in in the entire graph and those are the

1205
00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:16,269
kind of picking the top ten or so or

1206
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:18,710
what we're going to call on VIPs and and

1207
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:22,399
and try to measure in some meaningful

1208
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:23,160
way that these these guys we think are

1209
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,910
the actual

1210
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,770
content producers on the forum and once

1211
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:31,830
we have the VIPs we can kind of

1212
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:34,230
correlate on all our data from step to

1213
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:35,850
sort of reduced list of kind of tokens

1214
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:38,010
and interesting words of yeah these are

1215
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:40,650
using look for OPSEC fails there and

1216
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:42,660
then finally if we have and we'll kind

1217
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:45,210
of talk about correlating images to in

1218
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:47,100
this final step in the next slide or so

1219
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,890
but basically finally once we have I'm

1220
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,660
sure the pictures of the VIPs and if if

1221
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:54,299
we're doing some image recognition what

1222
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,529
we're gonna do is run some of these deep

1223
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,170
learning algorithms which we're going to

1224
00:56:55,530 --> 00:57:00,050
talk about to compute hashes look for

1225
00:56:58,170 --> 00:57:04,830
things like the traffic cam stuff

1226
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:06,690
correlate just just even add a minimum

1227
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:08,520
level with what country is this picture

1228
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:10,620
in if we can do that automatically

1229
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:16,620
that's also that's already a waiting for

1230
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:22,080
law enforcement and so I think the last

1231
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:23,670
just one last wall alright so let me

1232
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,740
just kind of tell this last little story

1233
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:30,030
here just about like kind of the deep

1234
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:31,890
learning aspect for for how we got

1235
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:34,530
exposed to something called photo DNA

1236
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:36,029
and this is photo DNA's on Microsoft

1237
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:38,870
Ireland we were this is that the

1238
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:41,010
original hackathon we're at and

1239
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:43,830
basically this is the this is the output

1240
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:45,240
of photo DNA for for two pictures

1241
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:47,160
basically the only thing different in

1242
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,439
the picture is like one little piece and

1243
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,240
so you can see what photo DNA does is it

1244
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,950
computes a hash this is sort of poverty

1245
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,390
yeah it's just sort of like the

1246
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:58,620
representation of a matrix for each

1247
00:57:54,390 --> 00:58:00,930
picture and with this with this picture

1248
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:02,850
what you can do so here's here's a

1249
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:04,950
here's mothers just like my childhood

1250
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:07,380
friend at his high school picture and

1251
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:09,390
his picture that was like on ESPN in a

1252
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:11,760
World Cup game and these are these are

1253
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:14,129
separated by about five years and what

1254
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,960
photo do you may let you do when you get

1255
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:19,290
this when you get these two numbers and

1256
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:21,360
that's like it's called a similarity

1257
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:23,380
metric I can ask that how similar are

1258
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:25,870
two pictures and

1259
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,400
in this case Florina will tell us like

1260
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:29,620
there's like a 90 percent similarity

1261
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:32,260
that this person is actually the same

1262
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:34,900
person and we saw the Microsoft team

1263
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:37,780
just kind of take this technology and

1264
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:39,850
what they did at this time they had yeah

1265
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:42,280
about six months of back page scrapes

1266
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:45,190
and they have five thousands

1267
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,810
missing-persons reports from California

1268
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:48,510
and so what they did was they took every

1269
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:50,820
picture of the missing persons report

1270
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:53,230
correlated against it sort of a

1271
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:55,990
carefully selected subset a back page

1272
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:57,730
and just with that five thousand with

1273
00:58:55,990 --> 00:59:00,879
those five thousand images just in that

1274
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:03,280
like 24-hour hackathon they they

1275
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,580
correlated to one person who who ahead

1276
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,170
and turnout ended up in another state

1277
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:09,640
she was either kidnapped or a runaway

1278
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:13,540
but they basically were able to take

1279
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:15,549
action on like a like a an open case and

1280
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,440
it was it was just during a half a

1281
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:18,940
packet on proof-of-concept and it was

1282
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,920
using some of these this is sort of

1283
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,810
really kind of where deep learning and a

1284
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,850
lot of these kind of things are very

1285
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,890
powerful in the image recognition case

1286
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:29,640
and so those those are mainly the two

1287
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,640
stories who want to say

1288
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:38,920
[Applause]

1289
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:42,280
well thank you very much your sandy

1290
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:44,020
questions if not then that we'll see you

1291
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,670
next year and thank you for an awesome

1292
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:53,390
conference

1293
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:53,390
[Applause]
