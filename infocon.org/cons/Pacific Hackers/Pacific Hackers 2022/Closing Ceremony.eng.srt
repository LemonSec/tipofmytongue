closing ceremony so

271
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,019
overall what are you guys seeing was it

272
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:38,060
a great event or not yeah all right

273
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,019
yeah let me um like Jen said we

274
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,360
um it took a lot of work to do this

275
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,459
um it was a last minute decision

276
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,519
we started doing this in preparation in

277
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,420
July

278
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,880
and uh we obviously didn't have enough

279
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,779
time to to do more before we we used to

280
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,019
have the conference for two days and um

281
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,120
and multiple tracks

282
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
but it was not enough time to to bring

283
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,099
what we used to bring uh so we ended

284
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,280
just deciding to do one track uh

285
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,959
a talks uh or more uh workshops and I

286
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,900
think one kid so with that

287
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,939
um we're looking forward to facility

288
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,579
hackers conference 2023 obviously it's

289
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,619
gonna come back in November because the

290
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,480
original so it's a little wondering why

291
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,720
in November is because again we our

292
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,820
mission is to help uh veterans and

293
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,400
underrepresented communities and because

294
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,840
veterans uh they Falls in November 11 we

295
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,120
try to do a the conference around that

296
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,640
time this year again we have to pick a

297
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,059
random day not you know after uh

298
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,880
variously but so for next year we're

299
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,760
thinking either do it before uh Veterans

300
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,400
Day or during November various day so

301

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,100
to put up together

339
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,419
um you actually flew in uh Jackie thank

340
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,799
you very much with all your help this

341
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,840
would not have been possible even just

342
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,419
all the speakers when somebody comes to

343
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,120
your dog uh to adopt and your conference

344
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,919
basically they're investing their time

345
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,320
and they are putting their trust in you

346
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,200
so for that we all of us are very

347
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,419
thankful uh hopefully we'll be able to

348
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,820
continue this doing the step of events

349
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,240
we have a lot of ideas that include uh

350
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,100
Hands-On stuff CBS uh uh mini coms every

351
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,320
two or three months so we want to keep

352
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,240
the momentum going I want to keep you

353
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,940
guys coming and learning and interacting

354
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,400
and getting better

355
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,340
I hope you enjoy it uh the last feedback

356
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,500
I got when I was from P hack 2 is that

357
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,120
you guys don't like to come on Sundays

358
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,960
to conferences so um if you like it like

359
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,520
that it would even on Saturday and

360
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Friday uh but if you truly would like to

361
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,400
have a three-day event then please let

362
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,260
us know and then we'll we'll work on it

363
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,059
and try to put it together other than

364
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,980
that I'll be around if you want to speak

365
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,820
to me if you uh also happen to travel to

366
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,760
the east coast uh or probably you'll

367
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,160
probably see me or hack Miami uh which

368
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,820
we have a conference on May uh 2023 and

369
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,700
then in Pacific hackers we'll probably

370
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,940
be running the doctors Village at RSA

371
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,820
conference 2023 so for all of you that

372
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,799
have come today and spoke there is an

373
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,080
opportunity to actually speak they are

374
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,059
saying sandbox so we will be contacting

375
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,220
you because we wanna we want you to

376
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,200
succeed or want you to be at

377
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,840
representing one right because when you

378
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,360
go to an event or the size of RSA

379
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,120
obviously the the level of protections

380
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,480
is way higher right so uh we I believe

381
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,820
that basically anyone here today you can

382
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,340
speak that RSA conference so again thank

383
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,660
you very much and I'll be seeing you
