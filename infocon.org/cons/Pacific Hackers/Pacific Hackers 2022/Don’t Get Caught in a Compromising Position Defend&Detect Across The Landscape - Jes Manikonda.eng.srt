1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,700
we will be wrong so with that I want to

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,620
introduce um

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,039
Jess who who worked with me at the

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,279
casino

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,039
like with BS blog for a while uh he's an

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,260
awesome infotech professional and he's

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,099
now at a very uh well-known and up and

8
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,399
coming startup called MB logic am I

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,219
pronouncing it right okay so he's here

10
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,500
to talk to you about this then and

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,100
detect across your threat landscape so

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,739
give it up for jazz please thank you

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,440
foreign

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,040
s are going on

15
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,180
so what we're going to talk about today

16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,460
is kind of going into the Journey of how

17
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,439
you know how the shop lives and what can

18
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,820
we do to improve like you know what we

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,740
have been doing uh that's helping some

20
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,720
of the soft teams uh that we are working

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,780
with so to get started I'll kind of

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,280
quickly go about you know introduce

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,380
myself you know my big background of you

24
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,420
know how how I came along here and then

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,860
we'll go into the details of like you

26
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,140
know can I have a taking example of how

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,880
the alerts are coming in like you know

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,619
how they are building you know reviews

29
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,259
you know detected and whatnot and then

30
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,060
kind of taking an example of going into

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,880
the automation side of the house yes let

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,798
me get started you know my name is

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,099
give a quick introduction uh I've had

34
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,959
like a privilege of working with some of

35
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,300
the not really big startups um you know

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,980
I started Works economics as one of the

37
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,200
founding members of the team kind of you

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,360
know being you know in that space of can

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,160
set a threat you know to build a startup

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,319
from ground up all the way to you know

41
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,599
you're all familiar with economics one

42
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,280
of the leading Sim Traditions right now

43
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
in the space then I joined Splunk or

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,260
Chris Peter and then got acquired into

45
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,200
you know uh Splunk which which again

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
like you know we brought up a speeder

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,980
from the startup days into one of its

48
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,260
leading uh you know vendors within the

49
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,300
government and then I kind of

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,519
transitioned into logic recently where

51
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,680
again it's a startup we're a founding

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,720
team we are building pretty much like

53
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,580
what we have seen in the park in the

54
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,379
last decade or so I've worked with

55
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,780
almost like an opportunity plus stock uh

56
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,700
on the customers trying to build their

57
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,379
sock and then kind of saving the paint

58
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,420
and then we brought into the executive

59
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,800
professionals from different Arena

60
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,900
specifically the actual practitioners

61
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
like the soft practitioners stock

62
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,739
managers and whatnot and then we brought

63
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,239
all of them and then kind of you know

64
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,340
built started building this product you

65
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,080
cannot understand the core problem of

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,420
the soft dysfunctioning and then like

67
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,980
you know trying to eliminate some of

68
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,180
this you know day-to-day people

69
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,680
challenges with the product

70
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,000
background about myself in terms of like

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,280
my technical expertise you know I'm not

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,080
just on the security but you know I have

73
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,819
a product experience Building Products

74
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,040
more of a product managerial role and

75
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,200
then like you know uh also being on the

76
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,379
sales side and also as well as developer

77
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,360
myself so kind of being in you know

78
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,879
different uh you know Arena to kind of

79
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,099
you know kind of get that experience

80
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,260
so let's get started right you know

81
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,760
typically like you know you're all

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,319
familiar with this pyramid of pain like

83
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,819
you know where you start with you know

84
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,580
this trivial hash detections all the way

85
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,799
moving up to the ttps I don't know how

86
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,879
many of you have been like you know

87
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,860
moving up the chain in the in that kind

88
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,799
of pyramid level but we can pretty much

89
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,840
if you look at any of the stock they do

90
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,159
all of this like you know they kind of

91
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,900
do the hash level detections with some

92
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,120
of the tools that they have uh like you

93
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,519
know half an IPS or domain names based

94
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:15,840
on the thread Intel that that you

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
already are sending from various tools

96
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,500
and then you start building like in more

97
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,199
complex level of detections by like you

98
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,280
know maintaining an asset management

99
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,800
tool or whatnot to look at your network

100
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,780
artifacts and then you know you're

101
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,639
slowly going into the application space

102
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,860
and then finally looking at the threat

103
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,900
landscape in terms of who are the thread

104
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,280
actors like you know how are they doing

105
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,380
and they're kind of work right it's it's

106
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,180
more of like you know it's an ioc driven

107
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,620
like especially if you're starting at

108
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,080
the bottom of the river it's more ioc

109
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,380
driven and it's very noisy and it's this

110
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,199
the context is really really limited and

111
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,419
then you know it's that's where a lot of

112
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,100
people are suffering and then people

113
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,320
started as they go reading like you know

114
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,860
to the upper part of the pyramid it gets

115
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,300
complex right and that's where the

116
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,860
scarcity of the people comes into the

117
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,840
picture because you know when you talk

118
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,639
about sock like you know one of the big

119
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,800
problem is people detection are also

120
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,360
getting the right set of skill set like

121
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,860
you have to you know ramp up the game

122
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,960
right that's that's where like you know

123
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,759
most of the socks are you know separate

124
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,740
because you know the database I mean the

125
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,560
low level deduction is pretty easy uh

126
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,479
you have tools for it but then as you go

127
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,639
up the pyramid you need more skill set

128
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,500
like that's where a lot of human rights

129
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,600
in this concept

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,880
um and I love songs like at least from

131
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,039
what we are going to graduate in the

132
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,539
past they're all struggling with it

133
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:34,979
because they really don't have the skill

134
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,080
set nor they have time like you know

135
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,000
because of the old volume that that is

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,800
being generated with all this low level

137
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,780
indicators like you know the hashes or

138
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,460
IPS and whatnot

139
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,800
how do you solve this focal problem

140
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,280
right now you you may not be thinking

141
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,660
like yeah we have seen the spirit of

142
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,820
pain like you know what what about it

143
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,460
right now right no so what we are saying

144
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,320
is let's clip that game right now right

145
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,699
instead of looking at the perimeter of

146
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,440
bottom up where you start building the

147
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,759
hash here so you start building them

148
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,080
next level of detection it's increasing

149
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,060
the complexity of the detections flip

150
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,740
the pyramid and then kind of you know

151
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,720
reverse it in such a way that you can

152
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,940
actually manage them what real the

153
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,860
offers that we have taken like in our

154
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,240
one of the past companies as well as

155
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,100
right now that's really looking for in a

156
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,440
majority of the organizations is we look

157
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,460
at all the environments it doesn't

158
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,020
matter what type of events it is whether

159
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,580
it's networked like you know Cloud

160
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,460
related infrastructure uh your endpoint

161
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,199
related to touch it doesn't matter like

162
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,060
you know it could be any events that

163
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,460
we're capturing or even the artifacts of

164
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,199
this you know the systems that are out

165
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,780
there we collect those and then we built

166
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,419
something called a threat identifiers so

167
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,280
think of basic or base level detections

168
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,020
this could be a you know half level

169
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,340
detections or this could be

170
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,479
each of you are building all of these

171
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,819
right now the challenge will the next

172
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,620
step is you're actually you're sending

173
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,600
these set of detections there and that's

174
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,039
coming out of these detections directly

175
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,199
to the tree outside of the house that's

176
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,639
where people are struggling because you

177
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,080
know the volume of these are really

178
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,259
really high and you know so the triage

179
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,759
side of the house is trying to you know

180
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,979
you know consolidate them come up with

181
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,419
story around it because you know they

182
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,039
really don't have contacts it's a point

183
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,780
in time like you know under very you

184
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,699
know isolated event you'll now have to

185
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,319
point the story around it and determine

186
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,000
what actually has happened around it

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,500
what actually has happened like you know

188
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,020
within the uh there is there any later

189
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,039
movement like they are trying to

190
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,139
determine a lot of artifacts to form a

191
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,360
story that you can justify and then make

192
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,280
addition whether it's it's a benign or a

193
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,139
malicious event or a false positive

194
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,340
right you know you're trying just to

195
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,199
develop that it's an ongoing process

196
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,620
that happens in everyday side what we

197
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,720
really want to do here is yes you can

198
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,580
generate these events but add an

199
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,020
additional layer on top of it right and

200
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,479
now don't just send directly the the raw

201
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,360
alerts from the from these tools or from

202
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,340
your detection engines to our triage

203
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,539
analysis like you know just put another

204
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,639
layer on top of it some people have

205
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,319
tried it with the source religions I

206
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,940
don't know if any of you have been using

207
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,039
the source Solutions but like you know

208
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,440
you know tools like you know the x or

209
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,840
the sword that are coming up they try to

210
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,759
kind of consolidate this event like in a

211
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,680
fetch the external threat in town like

212
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,960
I'll do all enrichment in terms of like

213
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,360
the the hosts or the the you know the

214
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,819
artifacts and then send it again that's

215
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,860
that's you're trying to put a branded at

216
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,300
the very end of the game rather than

217
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,919
actually trying to solve the cognitive

218
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,259
problems so that's where we kind of

219
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,680
introduced another terminology called in

220
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,639
right now we've been talking about

221
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,680
correlation but industry has not really

222
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,539
been using it really effectively so

223
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,099
that's where we kind of brought it which

224
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,659
is threat scenarios like United States

225
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,880
you're from trying to form a scenario

226
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,159
right you have a raw arguments those

227
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,380
generated some of the raw alerts we call

228
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,240
it or because of Interest with

229
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,160
traditional alerts and then we try to

230
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,959
correlate all of them in different

231
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,940
shapes and forms depending on the size

232
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,740
of the organization or depending on how

233
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,660
do you approach yourself you know you

234
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,339
could build based on a risk framework

235
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,600
you could build based on the credit

236
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
depending on how complex your stock is

237
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,140
but you know you really have a thread

238
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,399
Intel demon if you're really worried

239
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,140
about like you know managing the threat

240
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,279
landscape and then trying to

241
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,899
understanding and then reporting that

242
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,820
metrics up you can just really build

243
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,740
your threat scenarios based on the

244
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,720
credit if not like you know you can

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,220
simply just say okay I don't have any of

246
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,420
that luck today I don't have you know

247
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,519
credit details I don't even know who the

248
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,500
threat actors are let me just start with

249
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,240
a simple correlation engine right you

250
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,680
know it's just based on risk and then

251
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,300
like I'll write it in a Consolidated

252
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,640
based on certain factors that's where we

253
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,019
generate the alerts that are really

254
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,899
really less involved and have full story

255
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,820
around it so what we do in this whole

256
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,100
process is we are enriching at every

257
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,720
single step of the way you're not just

258
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,519
enriching at the last the very end of

259
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,680
the term that that's where the source

260
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,480
Solutions are trying to work instead

261
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
every step of the way where you are

262
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,740
actually generated traditional Among Us

263
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,959
to enrich each one of them because what

264
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,519
will

265
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,620
the better correlation story at the very

266
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,300
end where you can actually form the

267
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,279
story in a much more content way and you

268
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,560
also have another full story to kind of

269
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,300
you know when you're creating it when

270
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,040
you're reading even for the level one we

271
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,440
need not even have a level three or

272
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,660
level four kind of reviewer with the

273
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,160
level one itself because they actually

274
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,480
have the full story to make the

275
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,339
determination because now you really

276
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,560
don't need to pass it along so that's

277
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,540
that's the beauty that we have seen and

278
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,260
like this in methodology work for a lot

279
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,519
of our customers like a lot of the

280
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,600
customers like you know our customers

281
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,300
right now we have a lot of Fortune 100

282
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,740
customers right now because pretty much

283
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,959
all the large Enterprises are using this

284
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,519
framework I mean whether you know

285
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,140
whether it's us or even you know whether

286
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,700
they built it a lot of them are trying

287
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,899
in this approach and they're saying

288
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,600
results if you're familiar with splunks

289
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,779
uh you know RBA like you know list based

290
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,580
analytics they started with this concept

291
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,839
with a lot of different people are

292
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,700
trying it but we kind of made it more

293
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,440
more you know simplified in such a way

294
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,540
that it's it's you know you do the

295
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,000
enrichment you do everything at every

296
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
step of the Ring not just at the very

297
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,660
tail and which which is going to cause

298
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,180
you you know a pain do it at every step

299
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,860
of the way so that you have you know

300
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,540
metadata to make the right decision for

301
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,339
the right kind of uh you know right

302
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,500
point in time eliminate all the false

303
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,120
positives because you already enriched

304
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,740
all the details you can make a right

305
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,019
decision to eliminate any positives by

306
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,060
the time an alert is generated it's

307
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,160
usually harmful like what we have seen

308
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,459
is the case where there are 10 million

309
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,079
alerts that are being generated for a

310
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,880
single song it's it's a large

311
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,980
organization but in a 10 million or less

312
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,720
like imagine that that being practically

313
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,360
not react by they have about like 30

314
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,459
people across like you know two

315
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,380
different time zones 13 people can

316
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,779
realize I mean there's no easy way that

317
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,459
they're going to cover any of them right

318
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,680
and there is no easy way to protest them

319
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,760
as well like you know how do you even

320
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,380
prioritize any effort like and make a

321
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,760
right decision of which ones I'm gonna

322
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,860
try out right now so what with this

323
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,420
framework what we have done is with the

324
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,339
10 million dollars we actually got it

325
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,339
down to one-third right it's a big big

326
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,380
you know shut down that we got with the

327
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,720
Supreme Court where now it's just 130 LS

328
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
so divided by you know 13 like it's ten

329
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,519
minutes per day per analyst which is

330
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,860
much more consumable and we gave enough

331
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,779
time back to them so that they can think

332
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,880
about a lot more other things where you

333
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,100
know you're you're you can do a hard one

334
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,000
thing or you can start building

335
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,579
additional deductions the possibilities

336
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,800
are wide open Predator you're not just

337
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,899
training in creating the left itself

338
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,760
instead you are actually focusing on

339
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,260
like you know making your life much

340
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,019
better right uh the biggest you know uh

341
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,620
you know pain point that triage analysts

342
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,079
at least is that you know they're like

343
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,519
volume so we have solved that problem

344
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,980
which gives enough you know room and

345
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,779
contents for them to grow and then like

346
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,519
you know stick with the company like you

347
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,620
have a better you know life your life as

348
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,260
well right so what we have done like if

349
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,300
you look at you know how the whole

350
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,360
framework is right the very first level

351
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,100
of detections we call it threat

352
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,440
identifies right because it's an

353
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,380
identification uh you know detection

354
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,779
it could be as grammar as possible right

355
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,300
you know you could have any pyramidality

356
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,860
it could be at the hash level it could

357
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,480
be at the radius level doesn't matter

358
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,760
it's it's a granular detection you're

359
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,260
not doing any correlation we are not

360
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,120
doing any kind of you know sophisticated

361
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,279
detections it's like you know you can

362
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,540
you can have actually ml based

363
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,980
detectives as well like you know how to

364
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,019
ask for example they are really noisy

365
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,639
right you know but they have meant to

366
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,500
minimize because you know you are

367
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,839
detecting a point in time you know even

368
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,940
that you know it doesn't matter like

369
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,040
it's just purely based on a very simple

370
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,660
logic that you're applying and then you

371
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,240
know trying to send it LS now what we

372
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,680
have done is basically if you start

373
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,720
producing these a single instead of

374
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120
incredible which we call it events of

375
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,260
Interest like these are all the

376
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,600
different events of Interest where it's

377
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,279
much easier for you to kind of do any

378
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,959
kind of content or like you know kind of

379
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,940
reviewing these events what not there's

380
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,399
so many things that people do if you get

381
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
this whole Consolidated list of base

382
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,899
level detections and then you'll build

383
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,700
that scenario like you know it's like

384
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,440
you're building a sequence or you're

385
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,360
building a relation by grouping you know

386
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,240
by a host or a by a user or by an IP or

387
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,279
a domain like you know you know you can

388
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,740
try and slice and dice the same data in

389
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,560
a different sense that fits you know how

390
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,940
you're approaching like you can even do

391
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,920
hunting based on your hypothesis you can

392
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,360
start to look at the hypothesis you can

393
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,860
try to prove if your hypothesis isn't

394
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,600
true if they have I mean that's what you

395
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,700
do on the hunting side by the office the

396
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,139
challenge is you're always trying to go

397
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,880
into the pro events to do the hunting

398
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,560
which is often time consuming because

399
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,360
now you have to do the normalization you

400
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,620
have to deal with that you know you have

401
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,300
to understand the data so there's a lot

402
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,740
of learning curve as well as the

403
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,959
knowledge expert in that is required we

404
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,399
are trying to cut all of that down and

405
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,320
say how can a level one at a level to

406
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,720
kind of approach all of this uh you know

407
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,160
different activities that the soft does

408
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,839
whether it's you know protection

409
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,940
detection or you know hunting water

410
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,040
doesn't matter which part of the sock

411
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,899
you belong to how can we make it

412
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,060
effective so that everybody can

413
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,860
contribute you don't need to always

414
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,260
escalate to their the senior people for

415
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,839
you know getting it done right that's

416
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,399
the level of details that this kind of

417
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,139
framework it's more of like a framework

418
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,240
right this framework would kind of allow

419
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,860
that so that

420
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,920
and soft management

421
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,899
here you're really worried about your

422
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,519
people right now you don't want to

423
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,320
because you want them to grow you want

424
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,820
them to be happy you want them to be

425
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,519
sticking in the company all of that can

426
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,160
be possible if it kind of solves some of

427
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,940
this poor challenges right so what this

428
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,199
will do like and I kind of mentioned

429
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,000
about this funding Index right so what

430
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,680
we are enabled that is what we have seen

431
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,779
our customers doing is if we start

432
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,160
building these

433
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,220
the small small events have been dressed

434
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,779
like all the alerts that are coming from

435
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,500
the level 1 to 10 minutes

436
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,699
like I said we already seen that you

437
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:36,300
know

438
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,800
enough or two positives because you know

439
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,120
now we are really generating handful of

440
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,920
them the true positive rate have gone

441
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,360
significantly higher right because

442
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,940
you're already building the stories you

443
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,279
know as you you know build these events

444
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,139
of Interest you're enriching that data

445
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,480
with like you address your you know the

446
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,399
threat Intel information you can attach

447
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,380
it with the cmdb your asset information

448
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,600
like you know whatever you can you you

449
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,459
have data access to it we can start

450
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,260
enriching them and then you can do the

451
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,180
bid out the noise too because if you

452
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,100
have access to like you know your Erp

453
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,199
systems or you know your HR like you

454
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,459
know depending on what data you have

455
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,440
access to you can start populating that

456
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,000
metadata and then start eliminating

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,920
noise at every step of the way because

458
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,779
if you eliminate with benign events like

459
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,579
say for example where I've been doing

460
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,079
specific things I mean that's one of the

461
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,760
most common things that happened you

462
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,839
know when you're looking for any

463
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,360
malicious command execution right if you

464
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,100
know for a pack based on the data that

465
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,019
you already have you eliminate that then

466
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,880
that at the very beginning of the time

467
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,760
right so you you're not slowly building

468
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,160
this for in a framework where

469
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,560
the two positive rate is one grown up

470
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,180
significantly because you know it's it's

471
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,000
usually either too positive but mostly a

472
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
benign they kind of eliminated

473
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,399
as much as possible and then we are also

474
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,899
reducing the effort man elephant that

475
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,820
goes in every time in the entire song

476
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,920
because you're not just like you're not

477
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,380
trying to you know day after day like an

478
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,060
hour after hour if trying to triage the

479
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,160
events you're actually spending time in

480
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,480
the world meaningful way trying to

481
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,980
understand the whole overall picture you

482
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,720
already have the overall picture we are

483
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,339
trying to make a decision on this one so

484
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,140
it's it's that's where people come in

485
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,640
instead of actually trying to use

486
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,500
stitching together questions can stitch

487
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,540
all of the data together all you have to

488
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,160
do is essentially give the human the

489
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,419
power to make the decision of whether

490
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,699
that's you know denial or natural

491
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:18,900
positive and then make the right

492
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,179
decision to go out and do the additional

493
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:22,559
you know remediation or the mitigation

494
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,660
practices that's that have been brought

495
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,819
in place and then finally like you know

496
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,620
you know you can actually start Target

497
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,600
attempts like if your teams are really

498
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,940
doing a you know thread actor analysis

499
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,380
like you know if you're if you really

500
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,940
want to up the game right now you don't

501
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,679
just start with you know and empty

502
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,480
enhancer you want to start looking at

503
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,340
how different actors are Target I mean

504
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,600
which the doctors are targeting your

505
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,580
organization because your organization

506
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,620
is dependent on depending on which

507
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,059
industry you belong to and which

508
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,039
geography you could learn a baby so you

509
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,160
you kind of kind of provide that access

510
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
in that fashion kind of understand how

511
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,000
they are behavior and then you can start

512
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,679
you are trying to do it there Behavior

513
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,660
itself are you able to actually you know

514
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,460
kind of detect them like not detect that

515
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,200
balance because now that you have this

516
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,740
race you know index of everything where

517
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,720
you actually have the individual point

518
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,419
of events not just the right but you

519
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,220
have individual signals you can start

520
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,960
correlating those patterns in any shape

521
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,820
or form to kind of determine is this

522
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,200
like you know is this okay is this

523
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,940
aligning to a particular threat actor or

524
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,559
is this profile matching to a particular

525
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,900
signature right you can start doing all

526
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,880
sorts of different possibilities like

527
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,980
you know our customers at least let me

528
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,480
know the framework won't be proposed

529
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,940
this and not evaluated person is huge

530
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,179
because we have freed up so much of time

531
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:37,679
where they're actually existing things

532
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,200
for hunting as well all the teams the

533
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,640
big advantage that they are seeing is

534
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,919
hunting specifically because they never

535
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,600
had time to actually do the hunting they

536
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,460
have limited resources it's very common

537
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,260
from the sock that they really have

538
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,880
Community Resources and they don't have

539
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,440
budgets you can really you know go

540
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,960
higher additional time team just for

541
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,580
doing 100 because you know they really

542
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,919
cannot just now that we have freed up

543
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,539
that shriyas are the detective engineers

544
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,820
at a certain extent you can actually

545
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,280
Focus their part of time it's not you

546
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,080
know you're not from an entire time but

547
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,460
I guess part of them on doing this

548
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,440
content which which helps when a paper

549
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,260
in Excel much much faster

550
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,120
so let's take a look at an example right

551
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,799
you understood the concept that I kind

552
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,360
of where the framework let's take a look

553
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,160
at the example of how you know the song

554
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,460
You Know can be put into practice

555
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,620
very simple example okay I will get the

556
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,120
extraction group like an essay we'll

557
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,620
have a compound right

558
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,419
you kind of see this project this kind

559
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,260
of give us like mostly in spoken at this

560
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,640
point like you know you kind of go

561
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,380
through the different processes of all

562
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,480
the way from execution to impact like

563
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,860
you know you go through like you know

564
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,900
there's a privileged escalation there is

565
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,280
a different circulation that there are

566
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,720
different tactics has been used in

567
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,039
additional access like you know there

568
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,660
are different sets of things that kind

569
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,760
of happen as part of this you know if

570
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,320
you look at their signature of how

571
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,360
Quantum kind of Superfast uh kind of

572
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,160
breaking it down I'm not going to go

573
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,900
into each one of them but you know you

574
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,280
can understand they use different

575
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,860
tactics and procedures to kind of you

576
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,020
know do you know penetrate and then kind

577
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,940
of you know impact do their you know get

578
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,320
access to your environment and do

579
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,059
whatever they're trying to do right and

580
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,799
that kind of signature kind of you know

581
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,419
applies to pretty much any ransomware

582
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,280
that you can think of or any kind of

583
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,600
threat actor that you you know you can

584
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,100
think of like they either they are

585
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,600
usually grouped by either you know some

586
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,919
of the tactics and the specific

587
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,660
procedures that they are they that

588
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,020
particular pass so in this example what

589
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,059
I'll do is I'm breaking down into two

590
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,799
different scenarios one is the initial

591
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,020
uh in a set of things where you know

592
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,120
you're doing the initial access followed

593
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,799
by some kind of Discovery and then like

594
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,780
you know you know kind of creating a

595
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,799
background like in essentially you're

596
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,360
creating schedule tasks to do certain

597
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,400
set of activities the second scenario is

598
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,720
more about like you know addition of

599
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,039
this story like you know once I have

600
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,380
established in a foothold how can I

601
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,000
expand you know into the environment

602
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,200
itself like a kind of a relative

603
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,700
movement right so I'll break down into

604
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,140
those two stories and then we can talk

605
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,820
about how how you know how we can

606
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,799
actually find it from the detection

607
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,179
standpoint like if you're looking from a

608
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,679
detection engineering perspective like I

609
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,840
have the traditional detection works you

610
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,039
start building these individual

611
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,660
strategies like you know okay you have

612
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,039
to first find the initial access which

613
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,559
is in this case example it's uh dlf32

614
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,760
right you know you're trying to find

615
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,400
what you know how to integrated

616
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,200
what I have here is essentially a sample

617
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,200
code from Splunk uh how we build a

618
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
Splunk logic I don't know if you're all

619
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,260
familiar with Splunk but in essentially

620
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,760
if it's like a detection engine or a

621
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,679
data Lake and then you can start

622
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,200
building routes on top of it so what we

623
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,760
are building more of a scale and

624
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,820
scalable you know SQL core where you can

625
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,799
plug and play different modules but then

626
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,539
the logic can be you know defined in

627
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,159
such a way that it can apply to

628
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,200
different customers right so in this

629
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,940
example all you are doing is you're

630
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,980
trying to find a process creation with

631
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,400
Randy yeah that's one reduction then

632
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,960
some additional second detection is

633
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,820
discovering in this case like it's it's

634
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,500
the process Creation with either you're

635
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
looking for some kind of an IP config or

636
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,539
like you know in a cache what not right

637
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,280
so there are several setup you know

638
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,720
commands that have been exhibited

639
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,000
executed by content but what we really

640
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,500
want to do is we want to break them down

641
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,179
into individual pieces instead of

642
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:04,919
grouping everything into one Discovery

643
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,080
detection we've broke them down into

644
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,240
industrial components so that we can

645
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,919
determine and then kind of reuse that

646
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,380
detection across different you know

647
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,299
signatures it need not be in one single

648
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,620
detection because if you compare all of

649
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,640
them into one

650
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,280
it becomes you know it's a higher level

651
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,280
granularity so to do the correlation a

652
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,600
bit of bigger complex if you want to

653
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,580
apply the similar technology and similar

654
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,559
you know strategy for a different idea

655
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,780
so that's what you know doing as general

656
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,360
as possible really helps you unlock this

657
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,240
potential for you know combining things

658
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,220
in any shape or form and then finally

659
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,020
like if I have scheduled tasks similarly

660
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,340
you're going to create a scheduled task

661
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,260
where you know you're trying to

662
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,059
understand like you know there is a task

663
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,860
got created and whatnot so in this

664
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,179
example again we are going against

665
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,760
bereavement logs you have like you can

666
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,840
see the search where it's going against

667
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,700
the specific logs and then the event

668
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,140
code and whatnot

669
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,720
another uh thing is we've kind of

670
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,100
separated our daily fund because they

671
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,080
Define the reason for separating out any

672
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,600
point is sometimes it could be used by

673
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,220
that means itself or sometimes it could

674
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,080
be used by you know by the religious

675
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,539
attackers itself so if you understand

676
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,820
those processes the specific processes

677
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,100
that are used you know in in conjunction

678
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,440
with how radicals used if we segregate

679
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,419
them on then eliminating the noise would

680
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,280
be much easier rather than bucketing it

681
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
that's why you know going as granular as

682
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,539
possible understanding how your team

683
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,640
works as well as how adapter Works kind

684
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,200
of helps in this segment because you're

685
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,480
trying to segregate them in a nice easy

686
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,380
way to do anything down the street right

687
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,120
and then like you know and let's look up

688
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,500
for example and let's look up again like

689
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,780
that's the one very widely used you know

690
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,799
command you know not just the attackers

691
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,440
use it pretty much entire your team's

692
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,600
using settings not just admits a lot of

693
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,159
people within the organization use it

694
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,600
everybody provide the infrastructure

695
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,820
everybody uses it so that's why like any

696
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,039
of these granular things that depending

697
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,380
on how well they are used which teams

698
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,240
use it breaking them into separate

699
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,340
detections kind of help you make the you

700
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,020
know the fine tuning much much better

701
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,960
ones right so that that's one of the

702
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,419
poor essence of of this framework is you

703
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,880
grow as granular as possible that will

704
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,980
allow you to be more flexible you know

705
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,600
when doing the correlation when you're

706
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,280
trying to do the identification

707
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,140
again like another deduction would be

708
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,059
the W and I said again with similar uh

709
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,400
concept like a national lookup wmic is

710
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,500
widely used in various contexts and

711
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,179
various Frameworks so you really have to

712
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,520
you know segregate it apart and then you

713
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,900
know let's form this scenario right you

714
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,280
know you have built all these detections

715
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,200
if you look at all of this we have built

716
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,760
maybe about like in a seven or eight

717
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,280
individual point detections but we call

718
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,740
Credit difference now what we get around

719
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,240
the world is is one of the correlation

720
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,580
right you can build a correlation simply

721
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,620
which is the tactic plan right you know

722
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,360
you can simply say like in a initial

723
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,520
access product by some kind of an

724
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,799
executive followed by some kind of like

725
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,840
a commandment it's very simple as you

726
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,400
can get or you can get as well as

727
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,260
possible where you're saying okay this

728
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,840
specific signature in this case it's you

729
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,700
know the stage one is more about the run

730
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,400
dlls as well as you know what not the

731
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,280
different way execution followed by a

732
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,900
stage two where it's more about the

733
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,640
discovery which in this case the eyes

734
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,440
Discovery commands that we just talked

735
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,360
about and then final stage three is more

736
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,860
about either a persistence or a

737
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,080
differential so you could combine and

738
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,120
you know build rules you know kind of a

739
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,299
sequence in either as ground level

740
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,179
possible as possible that's up to you

741
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,520
it's based on your appetite with from

742
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,220
the tree outside of the house because

743
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,080
going granular would be much more easy

744
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,700
because you can build playbooks around

745
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,279
it you know exactly what to prescribe to

746
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,500
the the trial side of the house and and

747
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,559
it's much easier for you to do the

748
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,299
remediation set at the house but if they

749
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,580
grind if you become make it more you

750
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,620
know agnostic and more high level it

751
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,179
becomes a lot of complexity because now

752
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,620
you have to really understand look at

753
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,360
the raw events and then I mean look at

754
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,980
the alert that got generated and then

755
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,240
have to make the decision so there's a

756
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,640
lot of tips and buts if you go to you

757
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,919
know make it at a generic level so we

758
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,720
usually kind of recommend it going there

759
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,580
as Grand as possible even at this layer

760
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,100
too because then it's much more

761
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,320
prescriptive so this is one simple

762
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,000
example of how you work like in a bit

763
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,980
with a span of 10 minutes between each

764
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,080
stages like you know essentially within

765
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,700
20 minutes of time frame you're seeing

766
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,840
all these events that are happening

767
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,779
together if that gets detected trigger

768
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,400
an element right it's as simple as you

769
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,740
can get and then the second scenario of

770
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,200
continuing that story is exactly the

771
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,179
very defined commands under the regular

772
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,279
message and whatnot try to group them

773
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,080
into half they can be executed and we

774
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,820
kind of analyze the pattern of of the

775
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,260
quantum and then this is how it can be

776
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,480
structured within a 30 minute window if

777
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,400
you had like a Define followed by some

778
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,620
kind of wmrc you know you detect

779
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,320
individual signature sir the reason why

780
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,580
we are segregating this into two

781
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,100
different scenarios is also one thing

782
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,380
if you have the first pattern right and

783
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,120
if for any reason you're able to detect

784
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,039
it up front it's much easier for you to

785
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,539
lock it up front instead of waiting for

786
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:58,860
all of the entire scenario to be

787
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,600
triggered so again it's it's more of

788
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,340
like trying to play as an understanding

789
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,440
of okay let's do initial like you know

790
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,059
when the attacker gets called of

791
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,039
infrastructure let's do a detection at

792
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:09,480
that point itself rather than waiting

793
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,340
for them to go and expand literally and

794
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,159
then whatnot so it gives a leverage for

795
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,679
the team to detect a little early in the

796
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,299
game rather than just waiting for you

797
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,940
know and end game right so that's

798
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,799
precisely why they've ended up broken it

799
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,240
apart into two different scenarios

800
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,740
rather than just advancing each other

801
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,179
you can technically build it into one

802
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,100
single scenario as well it's just that

803
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,140
time to detect would be little longer

804
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,400
because you have to wait till everything

805
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,980
happened so you just have to play that

806
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,740
nice balance of what would be a right uh

807
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,480
thing where I can really tell the story

808
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,940
I can I know that I can you know say

809
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,799
whether it's benign versus you know true

810
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,659
positive but at the same time I'm not

811
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,279
reading too long writing like a nice

812
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,659
balance that you really have to play

813
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,419
from a detection engineering standpoint

814
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,220
that sounds like we could have built it

815
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,140
so if you look at this for you know

816
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,380
framework of how we built it for quantum

817
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,539
The Core Essence of all of this is like

818
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,679
you know you're breaking it down into

819
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,480
the smaller competencies very small

820
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,279
components that you build at the very

821
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,020
first the level one detections are

822
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,880
really really consumable and they're

823
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,340
often driven by your trading towel or

824
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,100
your red team assessments like depending

825
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,320
on how you have your teams kind of build

826
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,720
your Reflections you take all of that

827
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,520
you know intelligence and then start

828
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,500
building this granular detections right

829
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,320
here which is very very mostly at the

830
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,240
procedure level you're not actually

831
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,820
building the technique level go all the

832
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,020
way into the procedure level because

833
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,640
then you can really iterate in terms of

834
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,220
how how you can combine that and at the

835
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,440
correlation level right and then like

836
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,900
finally once you build all of this basic

837
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,000
you know at the procedure level then you

838
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,919
can start building the correlations in

839
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,539
any shape or form like you know you can

840
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,179
combine and prosper relate difference at

841
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,279
the same detection the same threat

842
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,740
identifier detection could be used for

843
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,200
any different scenarios right so you can

844
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,400
start building those you can start

845
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,340
building detections for your are like in

846
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,960
our open-ended servers you can start

847
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,520
building the same detection I mean use

848
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,799
the underlying detections for in a

849
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,900
malicious attacker itself so you can

850
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,700
start you know it gives you much more

851
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,200
flexibility in terms of how you can

852
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,360
slice and dice the data so the big

853
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,919
Advantage is if you start you know doing

854
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,600
this way like I said it's much more

855
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,880
extensible and modular you can combine

856
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,620
and you know shape and things in a shape

857
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,299
or form and then you can also be very

858
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,159
targeted of how you are approaching the

859
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,140
detection it's not like an open-ended

860
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,299
deductions it's not like you know ml

861
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:29,700
based detections where it's wide open it

862
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,500
may or may not be the system adapter

863
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,559
it's more targeted you define the

864
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:36,179
scenario and if it triggers you know it

865
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,039
actually makes sense for you

866
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,860
love I kind of gave you one example

867
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,020
right you know again going after like

868
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,279
depending on your size of the

869
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,440
organization not everybody will may have

870
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,080
you know their full blown prep without

871
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,880
games like you know full-grown teams

872
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,200
that start building these kind of

873
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,360
detections if you are you know short on

874
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,640
resources what we have prescribed for

875
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,340
measured if the customers is kind of you

876
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,779
know a pattern based of course like you

877
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,399
know if you look at most of the runs a

878
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,140
bit they have a similar pattern even

879
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,640
though the actual policy just made a

880
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,320
difference but they can follow the

881
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,700
similar pattern of you know I start with

882
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,860
initial access some kind of like you

883
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,779
know in this example this is one one

884
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,299
particular ransomware's example uh you

885
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:16,320
know where there is like you know

886
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,419
Windows macro institution uh followed by

887
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:19,799
some kind of installation like you know

888
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,240
where there's a process that gets run

889
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,039
and then like you know some malicious

890
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,679
good gets installed and then finally you

891
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,179
see a command and control where they're

892
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,399
you know fall and I'm calling home and

893
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:30,659
then getting you know the payload done

894
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:32,279
and then finally like you'll start

895
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,500
seeing the discovery happening in the in

896
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,960
the environment right it's a similar

897
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,919
pattern for most of them

898
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:46,740
in this framework where you're building

899
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,720
correlations not based on individual

900
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,000
detections but more at the tactic level

901
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,980
and say I'm not worried about which

902
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,779
particular technique or the procedure of

903
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,179
the years just tell me if any of this

904
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,679
pattern follows like in initial access

905
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,659
installation command and Patrol and and

906
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,880
cannabis object then you can pretty much

907
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,340
detect any kind of transmitter out there

908
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,039
that way you're not worried about the uh

909
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,659
the attackers changing their patterns

910
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,580
because you know of course there's a

911
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,100
thread actors evolved so they really

912
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,200
want to evade your detection strategies

913
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,059
so this is one way of you know giving

914
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:19,799
that brand light where you you still

915
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,779
will have your base detections but you

916
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,039
want to have the generalized detection

917
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,899
where it can you know kind of detect at

918
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,120
the high level but in this process there

919
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,799
is another bigger you know elephant in

920
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,799
the room where building this detection

921
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,659
is not that easy like you know you if

922
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,340
you look at even the simple distraction

923
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,760
of the four different stages you have

924
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,080
four different individual rooms that

925
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,059
you're building for each of the data and

926
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,380
then you have a correlation tool that

927
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,000
you're building at the top of the funnel

928
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,080
which is like you know five different

929
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,760
groups that you build and then you have

930
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,200
to do all the enrichment in your

931
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,820
documentation what not there's you know

932
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,440
a lot of things that goes around it

933
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,940
I don't know like you know from the

934
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,500
audience like you know how long will it

935
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,659
take to build these five detections per

936
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,760
se right or are you only done what's

937
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,620
your estimated time frame of building a

938
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,820
detection moving all the way to the

939
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,799
production

940
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,779
any guesses

941
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,039
anybody

942
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,559
no all right so what we have seen at

943
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,419
least like you know from our customer

944
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,100
base that we have been talking into like

945
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,799
you know between foreign customers

946
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,860
is they take anywhere between three to

947
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,440
five days for single reduction right

948
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,419
because you have to first do the

949
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,279
research you have to you know get the

950
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,419
right Intel to make sure you're doing

951
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,220
the right detection and then you have to

952
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,720
start building the detection you have to

953
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,520
test it you have to do the white listing

954
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,679
you know what not like you know do all

955
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,840
all sorts of in analysis before you move

956
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,000
the product so this entire end-to-end

957
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,940
process could be ranging from you know a

958
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,620
couple of hours to couple of days

959
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,559
depending on how well your team is you

960
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,059
know capable of implementing that

961
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,919
because there's a lot of dependencies on

962
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,860
other teams and whatnot right so

963
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,899
that's what it really takes like that's

964
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:56,399
what we call it detection because

965
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,380
detection engineering I don't know how

966
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,760
many people are familiar with the whole

967
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,620
detection engineering life cycle but

968
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,299
when you look at the whole how the

969
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,220
detection really happens there is

970
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,299
engineering life cycle if you're

971
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,919
familiar with this DLC if the software

972
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,720
development lifecycle it's a similar

973
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,039
strategy that happens within the

974
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,659
detection as well because you have to

975
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,100
start all the way from internet research

976
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,380
to do kind of a document like you know

977
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,700
to do red team or Bluetooth and

978
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,860
assessments kind of analyze you know get

979
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,080
the payload then build the detection

980
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,179
test it deploy it and then once you

981
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:25,740
deploy it it doesn't end there you have

982
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,899
to maintain it every day because you

983
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:29,279
have to look at the detection make sure

984
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,840
it's running you know it's getting the

985
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,460
right data everything is happening every

986
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,380
single day and then finally you have to

987
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,880
report up to the chain up to the

988
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,980
management to make sure how well are you

989
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,779
doing with all of this right it's a

990
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:42,659
whole life cycle so

991
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:44,580
let me just kind of go through it like

992
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,899
you know this is kind of what I cannot

993
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,880
explain right now right you have all of

994
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,860
these different stages again again this

995
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,240
could change depending on the sizing of

996
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,440
the organization we are like you know

997
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,779
how well your stock is but

998
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:56,880
and most likely like this is kind of the

999
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,980
rough rough in a schema that we have

1000
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,600
identified for most of the customers

1001
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,940
right so here is what we have done like

1002
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,559
now with the example scenario that we

1003
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,659
have seen the ransomware example it

1004
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:09,179
usually takes about 15 days across the

1005
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,339
board this is 70 to 80 of the customers

1006
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:14,099
of the organizations take 15 days to

1007
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,780
build that one ransomware detection

1008
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,359
across like you know doing that for

1009
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,639
detections one correlation building the

1010
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,020
thread Intel into the picture like you

1011
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,580
know going you know cutting down the

1012
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,679
first to answer this 15 days is too long

1013
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,418
right how do you cut it down because

1014
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:28,619
that's where most of the complex

1015
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,659
economics it is it does again it's not

1016
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,859
just one ransomware that you're going

1017
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,179
after like you know you're actually

1018
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,980
going after a lot of different things

1019
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,020
and the thread actors are evolving so

1020
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,639
you know it's a constant battle that

1021
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,679
this is where the whole Loop comes into

1022
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,540
the picture so we want to illuminate all

1023
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,219
of this like we can actually like the

1024
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,260
framework that we've introduced we've

1025
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,940
actually cut it down and did that

1026
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,560
product that we've built in so we kind

1027
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,659
of cut it down from 15 days until the

1028
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,639
matter of less than one hour right so

1029
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,020
that's that's the power that we're

1030
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,399
giving you to the detection team so

1031
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,040
where you can actually start being more

1032
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,920
effective right again it depends on your

1033
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,300
organization of how your team is

1034
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,160
approaching but the way we look at it is

1035
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,200
this is your overall process you may

1036
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,820
have disjoint tools across this because

1037
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,980
what we everything additional is we have

1038
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,839
different people doing all of this and

1039
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,400
different tool sets that we'll use at

1040
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,560
each of these stages so consolidating

1041
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,599
them into one single location at least

1042
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,880
as much as possible is a big move

1043
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,320
because you are trying to have all of

1044
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,900
this in a one single tool or one single

1045
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,579
like at least between the single team

1046
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,500
that can actually start executing and

1047
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,740
make much better dishes so optimize this

1048
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,359
life cycle the end-to-end life cycle of

1049
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,760
detection engineering would would enable

1050
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,800
your teams to be much much more be much

1051
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,380
much more effective right so again the

1052
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,839
last very part of the metrics

1053
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,820
I mean all of you may be Hands-On like

1054
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,140
you know you start building these things

1055
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,460
like you start building detections day

1056
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,579
in and day out but how do you actually

1057
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:52,140
you know give metrics to the management

1058
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,359
because see so for example right they're

1059
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:56,160
always worried about that they're

1060
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,540
thinking about a very different angles

1061
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,460
than what you all think the reason is

1062
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,079
the seasons kind of care about okay I'm

1063
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,460
like covered for this particular thread

1064
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,440
acting right you know if it gets

1065
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,820
preached like you know where are we with

1066
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,020
it like you know how well are we

1067
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,460
equipped to kind of you know remediate

1068
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,619
however how well our stock team is doing

1069
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,900
how can we be more productive how can I

1070
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,180
do cost cutting so the the level of

1071
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,740
thinking is not different when it comes

1072
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,599
to the screenshot so how do we bridge

1073
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:21,240
that gap between the you know the actual

1074
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,820
stock and LS versus

1075
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,280
another management that's where we kind

1076
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,839
of build like a whole Effectiveness

1077
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,000
program right you know think of this

1078
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,740
like you know we've introduced the

1079
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,079
similar concept

1080
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,280
you know it's similar to our credit card

1081
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,500
scoring mechanism like you know we all

1082
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,480
do like we all have a credit score it's

1083
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,160
a similar concept that we are applying

1084
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,920
to the song where some up can measure

1085
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,960
themselves day in and day out rather

1086
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,400
than just you know doing a once in a

1087
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,500
year kind of analysis it's a continuous

1088
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,720
assessment of where are we across the

1089
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,280
different you know gametes of the sun

1090
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,619
right the initial thing starts with the

1091
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,180
collection because everything is all

1092
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,940
about data because your entire detection

1093
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,760
program your entire stock transient kind

1094
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,500
of relies on how good your data case

1095
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,660
that's where that's kind of your brand

1096
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,240
because the bad data ended up so that

1097
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,500
means your entire Downstream

1098
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,000
applications are going to get crumbled

1099
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,099
if you really don't have your data I

1100
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,599
think which sorted out so that's why

1101
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,980
like you know you really don't need to

1102
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,140
understand what data you're Gathering

1103
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,700
like you know what's the quality of the

1104
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,780
data that you are gathering actually

1105
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,579
it's not just about the Gathering the

1106
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,260
data it's how well you're Gathering the

1107
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,940
data are we gathering for all the

1108
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,640
environment for a subset of the event

1109
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,440
right so you have to look at all of them

1110
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,020
and how available it is

1111
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,640
like are you losing some data so there's

1112
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,140
a lot of things that comes in at the

1113
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,700
collection level and then you have to

1114
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,500
strategically kind of escalate that with

1115
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,880
a different you know communication

1116
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,020
metrics for foreign

1117
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,200
embedding in your infrastructure like

1118
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,579
you know is there industry specific

1119
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,380
place from level and being in a specific

1120
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,780
industry that you're being targeted down

1121
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,640
What specifically is that you have for

1122
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,020
your specific organization so there's

1123
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,359
different sets of risks Frameworks that

1124
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,800
you have to bring in at this point in

1125
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,540
time so that that can be blended into

1126
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,760
your detections once your detections are

1127
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,980
strong enough you can pretty much use in

1128
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,020
your miter for example if you're if

1129
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,640
you're if you're already using it you

1130
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,320
want to cover as much as possible that

1131
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,940
is for telling to your moment it's not

1132
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,440
that you want to cover dental matter

1133
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,780
because a lot of matter things may not

1134
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,160
apply to you but you have to understand

1135
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,260
what parts of United specifically

1136
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,060
applies to you based on infrastructure

1137
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,619
that you have the adapters that are

1138
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:28,020
targeting and then make sure you are

1139
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,540
covered for that gamut of the market and

1140
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,560
once you've done that that's your

1141
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,000
detection Center for us now you know

1142
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,740
they started doing the correlation right

1143
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,780
and then finally obviously your response

1144
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,480
around the house however you know how

1145
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,180
fast

1146
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,200
you know there's different metrics that

1147
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,940
you can start you know analyzing and

1148
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,500
then you know what what can you do

1149
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,300
what's the workflow is that you know how

1150
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,640
how much true positives are they

1151
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,079
actually looking at you know because

1152
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,000
that it's a feedback loop that you start

1153
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
building between your detection team

1154
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,099
your triage team your hunt team and your

1155
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:01,079
data team if it's if that's a completely

1156
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,180
different team you know that's a big big

1157
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,400
challenge for most of the songs because

1158
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,960
that's it usually sits outside of the

1159
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,820
song so you have to start managing all

1160
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,140
of these three or four different teams

1161
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,579
make sure there is a feedback looking

1162
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,260
for each one of them

1163
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,820
again you have different tools for each

1164
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,980
of these teams so consolidating them

1165
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,200
into one single infrastructure

1166
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,180
trying to you know have a balance and

1167
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,980
you know very well communication between

1168
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,440
these teams is usually the key to kind

1169
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,420
of eliminate a lot of the challenges so

1170
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,560
that's what we have seen and then we

1171
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,780
kind of what we do is they when we build

1172
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,700
all of this we build scores for each one

1173
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,960
of these pillars like you know the

1174
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,760
collection pillar the detection the

1175
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,320
response and then combine them into the

1176
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,060
overall socket this is what your stock

1177
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,859
is this how well your stock is

1178
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:43,260
performing and this gives a metric for a

1179
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,420
seizure to kind of understand where we

1180
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,520
are which which parts of the stock is

1181
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,079
kind of struggling where do we need to

1182
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,940
invest for the next year or next two

1183
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,160
years right so it gives a really you

1184
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,200
know quantitative way as well as a

1185
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,300
qualitative way to kind of discuss and

1186
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,240
then debate and whatnot so that's kind

1187
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,160
of you know the Key summary of the

1188
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,320
overall framework that you know we've

1189
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,640
built and like you know it's kind of

1190
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,900
working with majority of the

1191
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,240
organizations so key takeaways like you

1192
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,619
know don't worry about the low

1193
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,500
retactions low quality detections let

1194
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,740
them come in but you know built as many

1195
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,960
of them as possible but don't look at

1196
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,880
them as the first level of analysis

1197
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,920
right build a correlation on top of it

1198
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,260
however you choose to do it we use the

1199
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,060
existing tools that you already have or

1200
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,680
you know get a new tool that can do the

1201
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,420
correlation for you build a correlation

1202
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,400
on top of it and then do all the

1203
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,839
enrichment up front like you know for

1204
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,820
the low level detections so that you can

1205
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,079
be really better at doing the

1206
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,660
correlation and then like you know again

1207
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,640
build that hunting index like you know

1208
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,619
how do you instruction whether it's

1209
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:45,540
being a data lake or a Sim of your

1210
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,700
choice bring that like you know bring

1211
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,140
all of those events into one single

1212
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,300
index because then you can power not

1213
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,980
just the detection game but the hunting

1214
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,540
and the Triad stream to be really really

1215
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,280
effective because they can start

1216
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,140
building more and more ideas and then

1217
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,060
finally build up your measuring criteria

1218
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,240
how do you measure yourself and then how

1219
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,119
do you you know put that measurement to

1220
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:08,040
the next level to the stock manager Auto

1221
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,839
Receiver right how do you you know

1222
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,640
bridge that Gap because you know you are

1223
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,040
you are at the the very root of

1224
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,540
everything and then if you can't come in

1225
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,920
indicate that to the next time

1226
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,380
externally it gives a lot of challenges

1227
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,940
that's where a lot of complexities comes

1228
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,220
in so build up that framework of like

1229
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,780
you know what key metrics that you want

1230
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,520
to really want to build up how do you

1231
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,920
measure how do you you know give a c so

1232
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,900
a visibility the challenge that you're

1233
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,760
running into but at the same time the

1234
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,320
you know the effectiveness that you're

1235
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,480
building bringing to the team right so

1236
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,800
you might have could be one simple

1237
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,300
example we have increased the matter

1238
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,400
coverage by expression but we really are

1239
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,020
challenging with you know sending that

1240
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,839
coverage to these traditional expression

1241
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,280
primarily because we are dependent on

1242
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,440
data for example right you know you can

1243
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,839
kind of build that framework not to kind

1244
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,339
of present that metrics to the board

1245
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:54,720
level environment

1246
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,180
so one simple one another thing that we

1247
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,619
could do like you if you guys are

1248
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:00,420
interested we generate these threat

1249
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,400
reports again based on every day like

1250
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,020
you know whether it's based on threat

1251
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,780
actors or the evolving you know threats

1252
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,339
we kind of give this threat to watch we

1253
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,380
kind of give you this framework of what

1254
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,119
are the best detections or what is the

1255
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,099
correlation so if you're interested you

1256
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,540
know you can start following us at least

1257
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,400
you can understand how how our thought

1258
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,260
process works when we you know think

1259
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,119
about any of the trade actors and then

1260
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,339
you can start implementing in your tools

1261
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,140
that you have clinical motivation okay

1262
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,400
they've said like you know big shout

1263
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,900
outs for like the data that we've got

1264
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,820
here like in the VFR and maybe not

1265
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,520
putting down pay what not

1266
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,760
if if it's not too late in the day I

1267
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,619
want to quickly pose a quick question I

1268
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:38,880
don't know how many of you have you know

1269
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,820
paying attention but I I talked about a

1270
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,740
low level detections and uh you know

1271
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,960
high level deductions

1272
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,420
can any of you say what puts the low

1273
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,920
level detection versus the value of

1274
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,820
detection

1275
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,780
it is the terminology

1276
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,339
never mind it's it's uh it's Saturday

1277
00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:01,040
I'm not gonna Force you here

1278
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,579
foreign

1279
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,619
all right that's it thank you so much
