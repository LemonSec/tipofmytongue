00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,380
work with me then eventually he started

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,620
working with with her and somehow I I

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,960
found her on LinkedIn and sent her a

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,700
message and say

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,379
um I would like to take you to launch

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,079

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,820
certifications you're already working in

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,800

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,719

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,920
wasn't for her six years ago I was in a

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,500
different place I was without a job I

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,360
was not in the field

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,400

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,159

31
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,860
but she put me to the right direction

32
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,020
and just like me there's many many

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,700

the talk

77
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,159
so

78
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,000
early last year I realized that although

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,280
I loved my work

80
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,019
my team

81
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,360
and adored my boss

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,060
I was ready for a change

83
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,099
I wasn't just willing to quiet quit I

84
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,819
wasn't jumping on the

85
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,019
right resignation bandwagon like for

86
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,920
what 4.5 million people have done

87
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,360
I I was I was simply ready for a new

88
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,500
culture

89
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,060
and work-life balance

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,280
there are at least last count over half

91
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,840
a million

92
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,180
open cyber roles

93
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,639
and in eight months

94
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,360
I reached out to

95
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,400
probably around a hundred

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,160
different companies I submitted around

97
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,919
150 different resumes that were all

98
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,979
tailored for roles that I was interested

99
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,660
in

100
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,900
even with the research and thoughtful

101
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,600
application I felt like I was just

102
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,380
throwing dark lines there's no feedback

103
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,060
loop

104
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,259
for your resume like

105
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,820
there's nobody telling you where it's at

106
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,639
you don't know who's looking at it

107
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,780
the response I got was limited and

108
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,600
really nerve-wracking

109
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,300
at some point you may find yourself

110
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,919
sending out hundreds of resumes and like

111
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,560
me not getting the response you'd helped

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,900
on paper

113
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,479
I think I look pretty good actually I'm

114
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,620
stunning I have a CV that makes people

115
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,419
stop and stare

116
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,560
but I wasn't getting the response I had

117
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,860
hoped I watched me up by Jason

118
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,300
Blanchard's method of hacking your

119
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,039
resume

120
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,460
as shortened and lengthened my resume I

121
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,860
wrote stunning cover letters

122
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,340
I made sure my link to Provo profile was

123
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,919
the end-all bill

124
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,240
but there were no calls

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,039
I was working with a company called

126
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,479
possibly

127
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,479
Michelle and Amy helped me revise my

128
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,620
resume

129
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,039
update my move to my profile and created

130
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,840
a brand

131
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,520
we brainstormed what I wanted to do next

132
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,560
uh we wrote vision and mission

133
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,380
statements all of it was great

134
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,800
I I enjoyed the guidance but there were

135
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,539
no costs

136
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,360
Michelle offered to introduce me to some

137
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,639
of her connections

138
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,860
and I was reluctant

139
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,600
and I turned her down

140
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,199
by the time

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,319
um I had a recruiting company reach out

142
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,199
and asked me to apply for a role with

143
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,940
the startup

144
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,120
they wanted me to be their season Chief

145
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,539
Information Security Officer

146
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,080
I was pumped

147
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,240
I had this in the bag

148
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,699
I interviewed multiple times I took

149
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,300
calls on weekends to ruin this company

150
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,000
and then I was ghosted

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,979
you know email

152
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,780
text

153
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,619
oh nothing

154
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,580
I had another word for the reach out and

155
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,819
I was hesitant I but at least

156
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,560
the last one managed to get me a

157
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,400
interview

158
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,580
the the company was a dream they had the

159
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,680
culture that I was looking for they

160
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,960
cared about the environments

161
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,500
they've had all-around great package

162
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,120
my first interview was I mean I enjoyed

163
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,699
the conversation I felt like I connected

164
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,860
with the team

165
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,280
at the second interview I learned that I

166
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,940
was

167
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,400
pushed to the last stage

168
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:13,020
as I was the last two out of 427

169
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,199
of this

170
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,599
for this role

171
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,000
I was laughing too

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,360
I didn't get the job because I didn't

173
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,699
have enough

174
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:29,699
environmental experience

175
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,599
how long is it that a person that holds

176
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,860
a masters and 14 certifications in cyber

177
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,399
not given the job

178
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,839
I may never know

179
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,880
but what I do know

180
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
is there's a different way there's a

181
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,519
better way

182
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,120
I reported back to my friends Michelle

183
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,540
and Avia possibly and I took them up on

184
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,019
making it in production of therapy

185
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,160
William young was someone to know that

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,040
octaves he was important thanks to

187
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,700
Michelle who freed up 30 minutes of his

188
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,920
schedule for me

189
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,800
he told me what he was looking for and

190
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,899
listened to what optic was bringing to

191
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,779
the market and I wanted to be part of

192
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,700
his mission

193
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,360
I also let him know that I was excited

194
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,640
that I was interested in the role

195
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,640
the interaction with bill was like

196
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,180
a pre-interview it taken away the need

197
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,000
for the typical first couple interviews

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,140
it was

199
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,060
to figure out who I was or what the

200
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,100
company was

201
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,160
after that I have three interviews the

202
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,380
first one took the recruiter second of

203
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,200
the technical team which I almost found

204
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,740
because I wasn't willing to say that I

205
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,060
didn't remember

206
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,300
how to remove the console scripting

207
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,820
um my second grace was that at the end

208
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,480
when I said you know I don't think I got

209
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,600
that question right I was honest

210
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,540
that statement saved me

211
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,019
the last interview was a presentation on

212
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,380
tabletops and I can't

213
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,220
I got the job

214
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,180
the job at octave

215
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,279
ironically was similar to a role that I

216
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,680
had applied for previously I

217
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,560
still have that denial you know

218
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,519
Michelle at possibly was the Catalyst

219
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,920
that for this first interview her

220
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,700
willingness to connect me with Bill

221
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,440
opened a door

222
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,440
but I didn't even know it existed

223
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,060
let me clarify something

224
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,480
my interaction with Bill did not give me

225
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
a job

226
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,720
I've got myself a job

227
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,980
but his interaction helped me bypass a

228
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,060
few steps

229
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,839
as my first call with the recruiter

230
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,279
was

231
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,700
about logistics instead of discussing

232
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,680
and describing the role

233
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,380
after that experience I started

234
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,480
analyzing all the roles and

235
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,360
opportunities that I had over the years

236
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,420
and I'm gladly going to States

237
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,339
that they all

238
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,140
all of them would do to networking

239
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,399
the babysitting here that I got at 12.

240
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,600
I got for my parents networking

241
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,200
the hourly gig at various fast food

242
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,660
joints

243
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,480
were through connections that referred

244
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,200
me

245
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,160
networking

246
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:11,820
going on active duty was because I

247
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,399
didn't send dial tone to the recruiter

248
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,300
networking

249
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,660
after four years in the Army I have

250
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,420
fought all my gear I set out to earn

251
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,519
thirty thousand dollars I was 22.

252
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,339
I thought that I knew everything I I

253
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:38,339
thought I was gonna rock this job search

254
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,680
I had a few leads of companies in San

255
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,040
Diego but I wanted to stay in the Reno

256
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,279
area

257
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,959
my first job after the Army was at the

258
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,100
El Dorado Resort and Casino

259
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,399
which after I got I got the job because

260
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,220
I attended a job fair the friends had

261
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,720
told me about

262
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,120
networking

263
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,000
as I worked my way through the ins and

264
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,220
outs of the as400 at the casino the Army

265
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,120
stopped paying me 69 days of leave that

266
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,720
I had earned

267
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,920
this is where the Army pulled me back in

268
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,300
I think it was their plan all along

269
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,019
because the finance person in the guard

270
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,660
helped me fix my pay

271
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,720
and then referred me to the recruiter

272
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,540
the enlisted me back in the National

273
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,959
Guard

274
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,220
and you guessed it

275
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,000
not working

276
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,519
the suggestion by my captain to apply

277
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,620
for a role with the Nevada National

278
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,639
Guard

279
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,740
is the point where I tell people I

280
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,639
started my professional career

281
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,480
he was the lead that started a 15-year

282
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,779
career as a technician with the Nevada

283
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,500
Army National Guard

284
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,260
as I look back on that opportunity

285
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,560
[Music]

286
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,200
I realized that I would have never known

287
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,480
the role it existed

288
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,720
nor how to apply it as the application

289
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,380
process

290
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,639
application process

291
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,519
is lengthy and

292
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,560
rewarding

293
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,019
as I told along in my career as a

294
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,120
full-time civil servant and a part-time

295
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,279
Soldier

296
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:44,779
opportunities to lead teams attention

297
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,820
and challenge my own personal knowledge

298
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,800
will buy

299
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,680
and grab them often

300
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,638
networking

301
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,440
some of the opportunities that came up

302
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,720
before last minute

303
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,760
I was asked to lead a team in Korea

304
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,760
or an annual signal event

305
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,040
um my soldiers got the gate knowledge

306
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,800
about signal systems where I got to work

307
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,100
alongside active duty peers

308
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,339
that were miles away from the Korean DMZ

309
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,959
areas of growth we're in operation

310
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,240
security

311
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,260
Intel tracking and Korean culture

312
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,980
not working

313
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,500
my most notable step into the Cyber

314
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,660
Arena was through a captain

315
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,399
that I had interacted with briefly

316
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,320
be called on a Thursday

317
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,620
asking me if I wanted to attend cisp

318
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,880
training

319
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,339
does anyone know what that stands for

320
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,880
um yeah a certified Information

321
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,740
Systems security

322
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,339
professional I still have to Google it

323
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,940
sometimes

324
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,880
I had to take a 40-hour course and pass

325
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,480
a 120 question tests before even getting

326
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,579
on the plane on Sunday I'll tell you

327
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,199
sometimes when you take a test five

328
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,180
times in a row you happen to learn

329
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,100
something

330
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,440
I was told that these five letters were

331
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,860
worth it

332
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,320
so I caffeinated up

333
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,220
swapped my way through the prerequisites

334
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,339
it's The issp Bootcamp was two weeks

335
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,220
16 hour days

336
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,139
and a culmination of 200 plus hours of

337
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,959
learning requirement add a stack of

338
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,500
three by five cards like this

339
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,680
how soon cisp exam

340
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,959
with a number two principle and a skin

341
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,699
intron

342
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,619
and who's amazing

343
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,760
but open doors for future opportunities

344
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,119
those opportunities like many

345
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,159
were due to networking

346
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,059
I was I was asked

347
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,819
and selected to attend cyber warrant

348
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,520
officer training where I received

349
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,780
industry training from 11 Sam's content

350
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,299
creators

351
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,400
Sans is a leader in cyber security

352
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,020
training

353
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,620
um

354
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,700
I I had the opportunity to challenge and

355
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,299
achieve a seven sand certifications

356
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,840
due to someone recommending me to attend

357
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,379
this training

358
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,620
I will never know who that person was

359
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,880
but it too

360
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,140
it was due to networking

361
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,939
in the military

362
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,780
a network of peers comes naturally

363
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,440
you meet people over training and

364
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,500
courses deployments and drills

365
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,799
that Bond you with hundreds of people

366
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,799
for a lifetime

367
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,100
even people that you don't know

368
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,400
that also serve will give you the shirt

369
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,100
off their back

370
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,740
when I left the military my husband

371
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,120
Carson

372
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,100
didn't get why I needed to hang out and

373
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,679
meet with people I told them that my

374
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,039
boss Antonio Ruchi

375
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:54,419
um Tony has said that networking is how

376
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,160
I'm going to get ahead in this business

377
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,120
world

378
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,760
he also says that

379
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,460
into how to breaches will happen and how

380
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,980
how you respond to it defines your

381
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,179
company

382
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,700
he was

383
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,679
Tony's right again

384
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,020
on both accounts

385
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,299
and I remember the people that I met

386
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,299
that night that my husband questioned

387
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,280
the networking engagement

388
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
I keep in touch with them

389
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,419
still to this day we help each other out

390
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:28,820
over the years

391
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,059
networking may not get you an immediate

392
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,059
resource however

393
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,500
it lasts a lifetime

394
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,700
the gig that lured me away from the

395
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,220
Nevada National Guard was brought to me

396
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,760
by soldiers that I had deployed with I

397
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,679
had trained these soldiers I've worked

398
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,280
with them along alongside them for years

399
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,360
their advisement is what led me to

400
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,059
entertain leaving the cushy gig as a

401
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,400
civil servant

402
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,419
the title of director operations and uh

403
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,240
salary increase set 25 percent

404
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,840
and the opportunity to work with my

405
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,320
friends and use my cyber training

406
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,980
was about

407
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,059
and an easy choice

408
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,580
when that role came to an end or boss

409
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,160
Tony networked for us

410
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,020
he he reached out to different

411
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,860
organizations

412
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,780
um and most the team ended up at Coke

413
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,240
the brothers not the soda

414
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,160
um I got a role program in the global

415
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,179
Sim

416
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,720
using use cases

417
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,600
creating use cases helping in the

418
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,200
response to incidences and working to

419
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,120
detect

420
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,000
to make detention manageable if only I'd

421
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,679
had trouble

422
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,520
extra yeah that experience probably

423
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,559
would be better

424
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,340
um

425
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,580
the work was awesome but the culture was

426
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,720
not my stick it was not a cup of tea

427
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
so I called Tony

428
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,080
and again came to my rescue and linked

429
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,539
me up with a cook with a consultant role

430
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:30,960
where I got to introduce to the clients

431
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,900
Board of the directors as the only cyber

432
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,080
security person for miles and not

433
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,460
looking old enough to know anything

434
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,840
about security

435
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,320
I worked long hours

436
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,140
to secure the environment of a large

437
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,880
Casino chain

438
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,940
my contract was about to renew when I

439
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,840
got a call from a former client

440
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,140
this client I had met years prior when I

441
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,220
had worked for the startup

442
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,299
networking

443
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,740
is how I landed a wall in a niche market

444
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,320
as a logical and physical cyber security

445
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,460
person or a wealthy family

446
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,340
it was a cool game

447
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,340
um I had a front row View at times at

448
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,840
Lake Tahoe

449
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,679
that was along with the freedom and

450
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,620
Trust to make sure

451
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,000
get the family and their assets

452
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,760
were secure

453
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,179
I built out a virtual environment I made

454
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:42,120
sure all the devices were secure that

455
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,880
even the five-year-olds

456
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,520
could recognize and respond to threats

457
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,380
um

458
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,100
and

459
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,720
legit

460
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,419
or Tesla

461
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,539
on the way to work one morning that was

462
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:01,980
the event

463
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,440
that made the gig at the lake

464
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,520
less opinion

465
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,400
I reached out to my network once again

466
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,500
and they came through

467
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,179
my resume landed in the hands of a Cisco

468
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:20,640
for a workman's compensation Insurance

469
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,159
Company

470
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,080
he was looking for an information

471
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,799
security manager

472
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:32,120
and I said bill

473
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,520
I worked alongside one of the most

474
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,799
talented csos I've ever earned or

475
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,340
or had the privilege to work for and

476
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,840
meet

477
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,760
Bert Carroll taught me about risk over

478
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,520
miter

479
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,620

and knows the penetration testing team

483
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,460
I became Mr human Heir on Halloween

484
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,820
after a company-wide security training

485
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,559
launch

486
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,620
um side note if you don't know who Human

487
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,760
air is Google does I mean

488
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,679
or some of the training in the videos

489
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,000
are some of my favorites

490
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,100
adding humor

491
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,480
to what can be a very standoff

492
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,900
and draining subject while interacting

493
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,400
with people

494
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,059
as secured and trained helped me build a

495
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,799
network

496
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,340
I was the first call when someone got an

497
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,640
email looked good sheep I

498
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,860
I was the person

499
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,320
the team

500
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,340
reached out to

501
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,100
to bounce ideas off of on all kinds of

502
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,620
things be it how to build a virtual

503
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,220
environment or a security program I made

504
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,799
myself accessible

505
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,039
as a service center for this talk

506
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,140
um on my job I need experience with it

507
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,200
up here in mind the other day and he

508
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,179
asked me if I knew why I never got a

509
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:23,539
call back

510
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,380
naturally I said no

511
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,980
I'm paraphrasing here he he stated that

512
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,100
people do not want to hire someone that

513
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,100
may one day take their job

514
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,520
that they make them feel less smart

515
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,779
yeah

516
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,039

517
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,120
people that know more about a role than

518
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,360
they do he shared his experience about

519
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,340
literally being told that he wasn't

520
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,100
being hired because he had made the

521

528
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,939
let that sink in for a second

529
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,880
you have taken on a career in a field

530
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,559
that is unknown but all but a very small

531
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,879
percentage of the population

532
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,900

334 million people in the United States

and nearly 8 billion people globally

535
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:00,419
less than a million

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,840
are employed in cyber security doesn't

537
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,240
it rules

538
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,980
oddly

539
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,400
the knowledge that you guys hold is

540
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,600
needed in every whole household

541
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,760
business

542
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,679
and government entity

543
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,799
it's likely that the person reviewing

544
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:30,919
your resume will not know that cissp and

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,000
thank you

551
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,480
and validate the same knowledge

552
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,740
the people writing the ad for the latest

cyber role

554
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,260
as Travis had mentioned is he still here

500 people that hold a GSC

559
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,720
let alone what knowledge it takes to

560
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,120
even obtain that achievement

561
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:32,640
they also don't know that cssp is not

562
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,600
an entry level certification as it takes

563
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,000

or two or more of the eight domains in

568
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,020
the cissp

569
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,179
common quality of knowledge

570
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,700
I I was recently asked to what led me to

571
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,799
where I am

572
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:19,140
I thought about it and my answer was

573
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,260
I have never passed up

574
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,659
on an opportunity

575
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,779

to have lunch

579
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,159
before you set out to meet people with

580
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,640
the goal of networking there are four

581
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,340
things that I would like for you to do

582
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,740
first

583
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,220
I suggest you polish your Elementary

00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,440
with the intent

588
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,159
to spark more conversation with a little

589
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,480
bit about what you did

590
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,100

591
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,179

security awareness

601
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,039
and and take the results of an

602
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,100
assessment and correlate that to risk

603
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,779
for the business

604
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,720

605
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,279

and then listen

612
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,020
and listen with the intent

613
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,179
to learn

614
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:22,860
not to convince

615
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,520
or teach

616
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,640
second

617
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,860
before engaging in an introduction I

618
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,419
suggest

619
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,340
you

620
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,039

life

625
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,899
intentionally

626
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:55,260
as it is the document that you are going

627
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:00,620
to use to tailor your resume

628
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,399
for the roller opportunity

629
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,100
that you're that you're shooting for

630
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,279
the LinkedIn profile can be something

631
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,580
that people

632
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,520
well people can become hyper focused

633
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,020
while it's not a TV

634
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,679
inconsistencies between the two

635
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,140
and Trigger more digging

636
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,460
or can be off-putting

637
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,980
third

638
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,419
place

639
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,480
for all that is Holy Google yourself

640
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,899
from the lens of a prospective employer

641
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,659
and what Secrets does the internet hold

642
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,480
about you

643
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,539
does your tick tock need to be cleaned

644
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:52,559
up

645
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,880
or your Instagram need to be moved to a

646
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,320
private account

647
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,399
I think I need a window too because

648
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,139
you'll get your own schedule incognito

649
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,899
you want to look at your personal brand

650
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:16,219
for what the world sees

651
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,980
networking doesn't have to be standing

652
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,679
in our room wondering how you're going

653
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,019
to survive this experience and get out

654
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:25,919
of there

655
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,820
I've been there

656
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,159
um I'm not a fan I'm actually sort of an

657
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,440
introvert I know that's hard to believe

658
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,679
um if you find yourself in an

659
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,980
environment take a punch bring a bottle

660
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,539
buddy

661
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,179
that way you can team up with the help

662
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,760
to make the experience more enjoyable

663
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,980
networking can also be you reaching out

664
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,860
to someone on LinkedIn and asking them

665
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,159
for uh information

666
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,899
informational interview or mentorship

667
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:10,020
let me give you some ideas on how to

668
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,780
find email or individuals to connect on

669
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,280

cyber jobs hunting a place for anyone is

688
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,960
to come to find work and network and

689
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,500
peers from across the globe and

690
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,579
obviously we've got the hacker dojo

691
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:29,640
you're already here

692
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,480
thank you

693
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,680
the fourth item

694
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:39,300
is that once you've identified the

695
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,960
person or group to connect with I advise

696
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,380
that you come to the conversation with

697
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,480
the mindset to learn

698
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,680
learn what they are looking for to grow

699
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,180
their company

700
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,800
learn

701
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,099
what type of person they are looking to

702
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,960
connect with

703
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,079
and the culture

704
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,780
of that company

705
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,660
people want to be around people that

706
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,940
make them feel comfortable

707
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:20,660
at ease and able to be themselves

708
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,280
make a conscious effort to treat every

709
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,060
yarn as if they are the only

710
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,060
conversation

711
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,880
towards the end of that conversation

712
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,900
asked when are both of these following

713
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,200
questions

714
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,599
are there any skills that you think I

715
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:51,720
can work on to be a good fit for your

716
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,460
team

717
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,820
do you think I'm someone that would be a

718
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,460
good addition to your team

719
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,119
can we set up a time to that discuss the

720
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,880
time to discuss both questions show that

721
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,680
you are interested in in their guidance

722
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,760
working with them and are humble enough

723
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,400
to to improve your skills

724
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,980
I would be rest if I didn't point out

725
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,579
that octave currently has a few roles

726
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,520
open in our threat practice

727
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,020
Bill Young the very VP that opened the

728
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,320
door for me stated that he's looking for

729
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,380
self-starters

730
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,000

731
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,640

732
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,800

phone's not ringing

736
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,900
the emails aren't coming in

737
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,560
change your mindset

738
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,980
