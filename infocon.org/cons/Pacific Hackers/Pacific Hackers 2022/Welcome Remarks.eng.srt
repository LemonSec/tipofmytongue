for being here

94
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,599
um so hacker Doge a little bit about

95
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,120
hacker Dojo we've been around since 2009

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,260
um we actually started out of a

97
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,940
hackathon called super happy Dev house

98
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,620
anybody know super happy Death House

99
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,879
ever heard of that it's one of the first

100
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,379
hackathons it was a hackathon before

101
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,200
hackathons uh so we came out of that uh

102
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,940
it happened so many times that uh we

103
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,200
said Hey what if we had a place we could

104
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,599
go hack 24 7. because all these events

105
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,920
we always gonna have to move and get out

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,140
but what if we had our own space so a

107
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,480
bunch of people got together and we we

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,000
created hacker Dojo so that was 2009 the

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,160
pandemic also beat us up where 501c3 so

110
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,899
not essential

111
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,459
um and then we were closed for two years

112
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,720
and we're trying to figure it out and

113
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
now we just rebooted uh this April we

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,900
officially opened

115
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,419
um it's still kind of taking a a toll on

116
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,400
us so our membership is not there yet

117
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,199
it's what's going to make us get to

118
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,639
break even our goal as in our profits

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,620
like break even yes we can stick around

120
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,199
uh that's the goal right so we can keep

121
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,060
the coffee flowing the lights on the one

122
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,979
gig fiber dedicated symmetrical internet

123
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,840
running uh in these cool events that

124
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,400
happen all the time so we post about

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,880
around 20 to 25 events uh a month so we

126
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,139
do have a campaign we're running right

127
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,060
there there's a QR code over there it's

128
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,680
our capacity building it will give us

129
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,259
enough Runway to make sure that we don't

130
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,720
close our doors this may so it's it's a

131
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,100
little tricky and a little risky right

132
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,780
now but we are confident with the

133
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,139
community that loves Tech loves security

134
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:06,240
loves building love sharing uh we think

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,860
we could do this so definitely if you

136
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,240
get a chance if you don't have the money

137
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,979
it's okay you could just share it with

138
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,600
your network maybe some of your parents

139
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,979
someone who wants to contribute to a

140
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,960
good cause uh so we can do this next

141
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,160
year and if you're after and year after

142
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,500
right uh and then maybe grow this thing

143
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,419
and get it to medium light Emmy or

144
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,160
Austin so it'd be awesome for you to

145
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,840
help out uh but I'm not gonna take too

146
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,860
much more of the time because I want to

147

Pacific hackers and hacker dojo we have

172
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,919
had an idea in 2020 during the pandemic

173
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,680
to just create a cool community of cyber

174
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,020
podcast guests so folks that were in

175
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,960
cyber security or information security

176
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,280
uh or or just doing really cool things

177
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,300
in in the area of Information Technology

178
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,220
and it's a five question in nine minute

179
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,259
because hackers never sleep short form

180
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,479
video podcast and so we have it set up

181
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,660
here in Ed's office so we appreciate

182

awesome too the main reason for it is to

190
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,620
grow just like these guys grow a network

191
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,620
now our network is is across the globe

192
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,139
we've had folks from the UK from from

193
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,240
the Ukraine from Russia from everywhere

194
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,759
uh who've been on our podcast and we're

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,660
going strong and so Jeff

196
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,460
thanks yeah first of all thank you to

197
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,560
everybody for coming out today it's it's

198
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,720
been a long road as as uh these guys

199
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,580
have said and so it's it's good to be in

200
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,280
front of people seeing faces again uh

201
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,479
you've heard the same word a couple of

202
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,160
times which is community right and

203
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,319
that's kind of the crust of where we are

204
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,900
where we want to go what we always say

205
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,580
on the podcast is that cyber security

206
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,280
it's like Eagle in the sun right and

207
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,560
everybody looks at the same Sun but

208
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,300
everybody's perspective is a little bit

209
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,880
different and so the community that we

210
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,340
hope to build is to share those various

211
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,419
perspectives because we all need to see

212
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,940
what everyone else is seeing because

213
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,340
we're looking at the same thing so we

214
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,139
would invite anyone and everyone to come

215
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,139
do a podcast uh again it's really quick

216
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,720

217
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,000
