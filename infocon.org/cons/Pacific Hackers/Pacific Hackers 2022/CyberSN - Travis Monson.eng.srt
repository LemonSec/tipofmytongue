1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,260
oh by the way uh we thought we want to

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,740
thank uh Cyrus and diverse security and

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,500

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,420
the awesome launch those are awesome

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,699
pizzas hope you like them and with that

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,080
I'll give it to Travis to talk more

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,698
about timers and so here we go

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,519
I wasn't planning on giving this speech

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,460
in front of everyone so but I'll keep it

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,520
very short because I'm also hungry uh my

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,059
name is Travis I'm Italian I am a

12
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,980
director of cyber security recruiting

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,899
cyber SN

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,719
um a little bit about me real quick uh I

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,960
moved to San Francisco 11 years ago uh

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,420
my first job was as a cheeseburger so I

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,260
used to import fees into San Francisco

18
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,640
very random my parents were like what

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,260
are you doing and California selling

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,440
sheets that makes no sense uh but I

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,899
worked at Cowgirl Creamery in the ferry

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,080
building while I was living in SF I

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,299
started walking every single Street of

24
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,860
San Francisco so I've actually walked

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,500
every single Street of San Francisco I

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,060
would not do that now I do not have the

27
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,220
time to do that but in my 20s I did it

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,500
took over 80 000 pictures of San

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,900
Francisco and then through networking

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,700
and through meeting people I I met

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,759
someone who was in recruiting she uh

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,920
thought that my story and how I connect

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,659
with people made sense to get into

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,060
recruiting uh and now I've been in

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,680
recruitment for eight years and then

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,680
with cyber SN for five years uh so cyber

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,780
SN well actually last week was five

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,520
years it's crazy how fast time goes by

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,700
uh but cyber SN is founded by Deidre

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,860
Diamond she was the VP of cells at rapid

41
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,200
seven added a huge background in cyber

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,119
security Staffing

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,180
um and we aim to help people find jobs

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,799
but also we know that there's many

45
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,500
broken layers of the job searching

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,200
process so outside of just looking for

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,720
jobs we're always helping get involved

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,340
in non-profits Connect people with

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,459
different groups so I'll keep on going

50
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,700
so I'm sure that you've heard a lot of

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,220
these comments within job searching like

52
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,220
how can there be 500 000 posted jobs and

53
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,680
I can't land an interview it took me a

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,620
year to find my current job

55
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,780
um I had 20 interviews and nothing was a

56
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,500
fit

57
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,000
um we heard these comments all of the

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,739
time

59
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,720
um and you know as a recruit you're like

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,760
oh recruiter like of course you can't

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,459
help everyone but you know we've seen a

62
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,860
lot of things of why job searching is

63
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,379
broken I think it takes the community to

64
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,120
fix this and it's really important to

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,459
know what is broken

66
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:45,180
um

67
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,720
so first thing we have seen is who is

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,060
like applied to a job that has like a

69
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,060
thousand requirements on it and you're

70
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,280
like you need a pen tester someone who

71
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,800
has eight years of you know correlating

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,379
Sim logs and is new to cyber uh no

73
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,760
uh so there's a lot of poor job

74
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,440
descriptions

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,239
um SEO is not connecting with the right

76
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,599
jobs also you are not

77
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,640
um seeing all the jobs that are out

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,220
there you never know if a hiring manager

79
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,780
actually has an open role on their team

80
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,540
maybe the company only has 10 job slots

81
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,340
on LinkedIn and you have no idea that

82
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,620
they have an opening so there are many

83
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,500
reasons why job search is broken a

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,480
couple others

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,280
um there's just core content out there

86
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,739
like I think about the title security

87
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,840
engineer what is what what does that

88
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,180
mean like how many different types of

89
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,720
then it's so big and there's not there's

90
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,480
not a common language within what these

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,040
titles mean so you might be searching

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,379
endlessly to find a job but you look at

93
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,519
it you're like this doesn't make any

94
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,080
sense

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,340
um so there's a lack of common language

96
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,440
within our community

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,540
um and also like a lot of these

98
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,980
companies they have recruiters but they

99
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,080
don't speak cyber at all and so it's

100
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,940
really hard to get them to build these

101
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,739
job descriptions and it makes sense like

102
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,440
you can't know how to build a Content

103
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,900
engineer role or signals engineer job

104
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,299
description so there's a lot of poor

105
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,920
content out there

106
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,879
um

107
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,820
uh other things is this unreliable

108
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,238
salary data just laid process so with

109
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,040
all this I think it's good to know that

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,300
there are many layers of the Jaws search

111
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,400
system that's broken

112
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,040
um but there is a community that it

113
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,780
takes the entire Community to solve this

114
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,100
so

115
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,080
um within the demands

116
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,040
um

117
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,620
uh sorry

118
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,780
um one important said job postings that

119
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,040
their organizations tend to be

120
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,040
unrealistic demanding to demand too much

121
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,800
experience too many certifications or

122
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,100
too many specific technical skills

123
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,000
um

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,820
and so for us at Cyber SN what we do is

125
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,220
we step in sit down with hiring managers

126
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,620
and understand what is the true story of

127
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,840
this child like why why is this world

128
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,940
open and

129
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,699
um help hiring managers understand that

130
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,560
you know there are different backgrounds

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,880
and skill sets can fill these things

132
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,680
it's one of my favorite stories was we

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,479
had an intern who came in she had no

134
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,400
experience and the hiring manager at a

135
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,560
senior security engineer job open on

136
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,960
their team and but we know her story

137
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,380
like we knew that she had a software

138
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,300
engineering background she had common

139
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,100
threads with her interests with

140
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,580
different team members and we were like

141
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,900
this is probably not the right fit but

142
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,220
you should speak with this hiring

143
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,960
manager and now she's worked with the

144
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,539
company for five years now so there are

145
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,400
many ways you connect with people Beyond

146
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,960
just endlessly clicking on LinkedIn jobs

147
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,880
um

148
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,940
so

149
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,860
one thing that my CSO did we have a

150
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,900
security team at my company they're

151
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,600
doing a lot of research into every type

152
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,660
of job category that's out there so who

153
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,520
is new to cyber is there anyone brand

154
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,820
new to cyber breaking in

155
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,120
cool so there like I said security

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,300
engineer could literally be

157
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,060
a hundred different things

158
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,259
um and it's really hard to understand

159
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,840
what is my career path within cyber

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,900
security like where can I go within pen

161
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,400
testing or where can I go with an

162
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,720
incident response so knowing what

163
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,100
functional roles are out there and what

164
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,100
your path could be is can really help

165
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,220
you within your career so we created we

166
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,960
mapped out all these different career

167
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,300
paths so I would check that out

168
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,360

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,380
a Data Center and I'd unstack unrack

194
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,539
servers and sell parts and so I would

195
