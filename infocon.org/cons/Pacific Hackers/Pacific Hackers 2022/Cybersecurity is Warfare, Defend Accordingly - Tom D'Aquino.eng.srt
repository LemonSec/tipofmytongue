1
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,500
advisor our next presenter is a person

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,139
that is very active in the community has

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,320
his own podcast uh which is to have

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,580
about that it just gave a wonderful uh

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,520
two plus hours Workshop about a official

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,220
school and works for that networks so I

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,019
am sure that this will be an incredible

8
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,540
presentation so I'm going to leave you

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,000
guys with Tom and Aquino

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,600
foreign

11
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,659
and everybody hear me

12
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,440
yeah

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,768
[Music]

14
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,840
appreciate everybody's time today

15
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,860
um as Ron say my name is Tom mcqueeno I

16
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,259
am a cyber security practitioner I've

17
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,820
been in the industry for quite a while

18
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,400
uh come from like kind of background is

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,520
on the on the blue team side of things

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,579
my first cyber security proper job I was

21
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,060
working in a soft or an mssp you're not

22
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,939
doing anything well I literally I did

23
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,860
the job nobody else wanted to do right I

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,799
took the grand shift worth like 11 p.m

25
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,840
when it said 7 A.M or something crazy

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,399
like that

27
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,520
um

28
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,140
um so anyway a lot of a lot of this

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,640
experience or what I'm going to be

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
presenting to you here today is uh is

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,660
informed out of you know kind of being a

32
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,060
blue team operator uh since then I've

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,120
sort of moved over to uh doing a lot of

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,120
solar oriented stuff and ultimately red

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,459
team uh kind of stuff and so that's what

36
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,980
sort of informed my open source project

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,160
that I've developed anyway this talk is

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,140
cyber security is Warfare so it's been

39
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,760
accordingly

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,739
um full disclosure I don't have any

41
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,800
military background I am a civilian uh

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,160
anything active or retired Armed Forces

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,579
members

44
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,440
good you guys keep me honest

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,080
as you know civilians

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,480
military veterans is not working it

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,480
doesn't make a whole lot of sense right

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,959
try not to screw it up anyway

49
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,120
um that's the fact that I'm a civilian I

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,519
think is actually critically important

51
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,739
uh as an element of this conversation

52
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,720
right because if you just hit the I

53
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,280
believe button for a second and accept

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,819
what I'm saying here that this is true

55
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,480
uh then you know as civilians

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,120
engaged in cyber security operations uh

57
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,700
and as an occupation it's it's important

58
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,860
for us to understand and warfare

59
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,959
strategy

60
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,180
if we don't like if we don't if we don't

61
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,280
know we're fighting more we're on a

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,260
disadvantage right out of date right and

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,420
so that's really kind of the premise

64
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,300
behind this so I did a lot of research

65
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,280
uh often you know various Warfare

66
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,299
strategies and I wanted to tie them into

67
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,540
uh I'm going to tie them into basically

68
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,700
comment cyber security practices that we

69
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,560
can employ we're going to do a little

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,140
breakdown of a threat actor uh their

71
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,260
tcps and how uh this you know kind of

72
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,680
warfare strategy self-advised to that so

73
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,560
I I suspect this will be information or

74
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,420
even for the folks that probably know

75
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,940
more about War trailer than I do so with

76
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,220
that let's go ahead and move on

77
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,640
uh so but if we're going to talk about

78
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,840
cyber security in the context of the

79
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,139
Warfare then this really kind of

80
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,160
necessary to go through a bit of a

81
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,199
program on warfare strategies so we're

82
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,660
going to start with that

83
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,440
basically there are three primary

84
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,900
essential Warfare the most common one

85
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,800
that

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,020
is sort of simple and obvious as

87
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,120
attrition Warfare it's just like it

88
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,280
sounds my gums are bigger than yours I

89
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,660
have more of them I'm going to assault

90
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,820
you with them until you relate it's

91
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,979
usually a very costly form of warfare

92
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,500
right uh it costs a lot of money to get

93
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,300
big guns distributed out you're talking

94
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,460
about

95
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,900
large-scale operations hundreds of

96
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,240
thousands of hosts uh I'm sorry hundreds

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,080
of thousands of uh participants

98
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,720
and it's generally a centralized command

99
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,780
kind of approach so orders come from the

100
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,340
top and they're distributed out they're

101
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,979
very explicit instructions that get

102
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,500
pushed out through the command and it's

103
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,720
about as far as I'm going to go talking

104
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,220
about attrition working this is not

105
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,960
especially useful they're applicable in

106
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,660
the context of Standard Security it is a

107
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,100
little bit but we're not really going to

108
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,660
dive into any more of that because it's

109
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,639
really not very complicated

110
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,040
uh the more interesting style of work

111
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,680
here is maneuver Warfare and this is you

112
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,759
know what I'll say about it right now

113
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,139
we're going to do a deep dive into this

114
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,180
you know or at least a moderately dive

115
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,860
into it what I'll say about it you know

116
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,259
is that uh it's the opposite of

117
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,139
attrition Warfare and that is

118
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,060
decentralized in nature right so instead

119
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,520
of orders coming from the top uh it's

120
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,800
it's more distributed I get into how

121
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,539
that has to work in a minute

122
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,520
um when you're talking about unit size

123
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,620
instead of hundreds of thousands of

124
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,120
participants or troops you're talking

125
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,340
about more like hundreds and thousands

126
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,340
uh so it's slightly smaller but it's

127
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,699
still a well-formed uh organized militia

128
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,180
generators

129
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,919
um and then the third one uh you all are

130
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,139
probably familiar with this uh referred

131
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,539
to as like gorilla Warfare or Insurgent

132
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,580
Warfare these all kind of fall into that

133
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,340
irregular warfare category that's uh

134
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,740
this is you know basically very small

135
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,720
units where maneuver Warfare we're

136
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,699
talking about you know thousands of

137
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,060
individuals and participants uh

138
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,080
irregular warfare we're talking about

139
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,900
you know maybe a unit of 100 folks that

140
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,020
break up into a you know a small six or

141
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,479
twelve

142
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,919
groups that would be able to carry out

143
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,560
the various tasks which we'll get into

144
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,199
in a minute and basically all of this

145
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,600
tends to be wrapped in some type of

146
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,699
intelligence craft right so there's some

147
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,860
some sort of spycraft that is regardless

148
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,600
of the Warfare strategy that you're

149
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,060
employing is used to inform these things

150
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,759
and direct activities so that's the

151
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,199
basic primer

152
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,000
um we'll get into some of the specifics

153
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,720
now so maneuver Warfare uh is largely

154
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,460
dependent at least how it's involved

155
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,380
within the US military is largely

156
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,759
dependent on this concept called the

157
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,919
void cycle was developed by this guy

158
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,220
named John Boyd he's a Air Force Colonel

159
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,840
he's a bit of a celebrity amongst

160
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,819
military folks definitely encourage you

161
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:18,479
to digging this up it is this concept

162
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,880
and it is also referred to as an UDA

163
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,860
Loop because leader stands for observe

164
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,199
Orient decide and attack in an act right

165
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,180
and the concept of a loop being that you

166
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,919
have to progressively go through this

167
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,560
process over and over and over again and

168
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,080
so a maneuver is really the act of going

169
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,900
through the UDA Loop and uh and

170
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,139
basically out maneuvering your opponents

171
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,900
with with speed and precision so there's

172
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,580
a couple of elements that are sort of

173
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,099
implicit or required to be present in

174
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,139
order for this to work but versus you

175
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,060
know that decentralized element that I

176
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,740
talked about so empowered decision

177
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,580
making is really a key component of this

178
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,800
you've got a you've got to give you know

179
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,900
your your folks in the field with the

180
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,479
ability to make decisions and if you

181
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,460
think about the speed of being on

182
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,639
critical elements of maneuvering Warfare

183
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,580
if you have to observe the situation

184
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,919
report it up the chain of command and

185
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,620
then wait for orders in order to to you

186
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,720
know make your next move that whole

187
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,180
process can be exceptionally slow right

188
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,539
and so your ability to move quickly uh

189
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,639
basically evaporates and so really the

190
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,160
the key element of this is that you have

191
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,560
to

192
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,240
operate with the expectation that the

193
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,279
people that are you know front and

194
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,620
center in the battle are going to be the

195
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,399
ones who are most able to orient around

196
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,740
what is happening how the situation has

197
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,440
changed whatever the next step needs to

198
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,300
be taken they're best suited to be able

199
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,040
to make that decision and then act on it

200
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,740
and do so quickly and so that implies

201
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,480
this notion of intentions over

202
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,279
instructions right so rather than

203
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,140
telling your team I want you to do X Y

204
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,540
and Z you tell your team what your

205
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,000
expected outcome is you know give them

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,860
guidelines on how to carry that out

207
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,620
right instructions are okay but it's

208
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,740
it's more so an indication on you know

209
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,180
these are some ways that you could go

210
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,160
about accomplishing this but ultimately

211
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,440
how it's done is left up to the people

212
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,180
that are you know on the ground carrying

213
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,459
it out right so it's you tell them what

214
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,680
and the why and let them figure out the

215
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,540
how okay so our intentions over

216
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,880
instructions and then if you're going to

217
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,060
empower decision making amongst your uh

218
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,560
you know amongst your team if you're

219
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,540
going to give them intentions over

220
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,700
instructions mistakes are going to be

221
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,440
made so you really got to be tolerant of

222
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,860
mistakes

223
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,339
all right I'm going to pick up the pace

224
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,420
here a little bit because there's a lot

225
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,839
to get through uh there's basically

226
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,260
three elements of maneuver Warfare that

227
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,680
are required in order to carry it out

228
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,300
effectively it's this concept of mission

229
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,820
type orders short pumped and services

230
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,040
and gaps we're going to get into each of

231
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,080
those so Mission type orders is that

232
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,360
intentions over instructions that I was

233
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,860
just talking about so this is where you

234
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,899
really sit down and figure out

235
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,700
um you know what are we trying to

236
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,200
accomplish and why and how do we

237
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,360
communicate that out to the to the to

238
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,140
the broader team the short pumped is

239
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,000
what they it translates a German word it

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,820
translates into focus of effort a little

241
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
interesting aside many of the aspects of

242
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,220
maneuver Warfare are actually

243
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,300
um oriented in like German command right

244
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,899
and this is you know largely some of the

245
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,279
tactics that enable them to be so

246
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,899
effective and designated Europe during

247
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,420
World War II and so it was you know sort

248
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,519
of studied and adopted by a lot of a lot

249
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,200
of academics after that because they

250
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,120
realized how incredibly effective it was

251
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,680
so one of the things that kind of held

252
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,959
over from that was this concept of Short

253
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,240
Pump which is basically

254
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,420
um you know your focus and effort which

255
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,060
means uh you know where you are going to

256
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,160
direct

257
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,720
the majority of your forces and

258
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,100
attention

259
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,040
and then the last bit here services and

260
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,079
gaps quite simply your strengths and

261
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,060
weaknesses but it's referred to in many

262
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,800
of the ordinary services in gas because

263
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,740
this is how you often confront them it's

264
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,540
probably they're going to experience

265
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,360
these strengths and encounter as a

266
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,140
surplus as a strength and uh it's it's

267
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,579
going to be you know where their primary

268
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,980
defenses are and in between those

269
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,779
defenses you're going to find holes or

270
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,240
gaps that you can apply your short box

271
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,920
to right so your focus of evidence

272
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,140
directed at gaps if you're going against

273
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,839
Services you're gonna have a tough go

274
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,700
with things right so so that's really

275
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,680
kind of what's driving this is you know

276
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,480
that the notion of being able to figure

277
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,220
out like what are we going to accomplish

278
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,680
or what's what's our objective here uh

279
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,019
and then let's go evaluate where the

280
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,579
enemy surfaces are let's figure out

281
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,019
where their gaps are and then we're

282
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,700
going to put our focuses method on those

283
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,899
gaps

284
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,300
so some of this might start to sound

285
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,279
familiar right like this kind of sounds

286
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,680
like what we're defending against uh

287
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,200
from a from a cyber security standpoint

288
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,100
right

289
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,380
um and one of the key elements um so

290
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,880
there's a three other you know

291
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,060
supporting factors that go into uh

292
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,500
everything I just talked about and one

293
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,600
of them is the reconnaissance poll so

294
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,279
that the question is you know if we're

295
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,260
targeting enemy services and gaps how do

296
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,579
we determine where those Services can

297
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,220
have some so medieval warfare has this

298
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,740
term called Recon poll uh where you're

299
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,420
basically sending out a reconnaissance

300
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,519
screen and doing a work to figure out

301
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,040
where the enemy surfaces and gaps are so

302
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,320
again sounding really familiar to the

303
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,060
kinds of things that the adversaries are

304
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,380
doing that we're likely defending the

305
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,640
Illustrated they're going to start with

306
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,620
some kind of reconnaissance and work

307
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,480
their way into you know figuring out

308
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,920
where the holes are that they can move

309
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,980
in moving through into your environment

310
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,720
in addition in addition to

311
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,220
reconnaissance poll there's this concept

312
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,260
of Firepower that's uh you know probably

313
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,360
pretty obvious with with Warfare but in

314
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,700
maneuver Warfare uh it's oriented around

315
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,920
this concept of combined arms which

316
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,200
basically means it's not enough to have

317
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,260
uh you know one type of attack uh you

318
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,000
have to mount multiple attacks together

319
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,639
that effectively put your enemy on the

320
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,680
horns of a dilemma as the coil appear so

321
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,420
as I pull this out of a book called

322
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,480
umare handbook uh and it's a really

323
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,639
short piece of work actually so

324
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,579
definitely recommend digging into it

325
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,600
it's really easy to read but it's

326
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,459
basically one of the cinema works on on

327
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,620
this particular topic so

328
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,540
um the author here William S land is

329
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,000
basically talking about what it means to

330
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,980
put the enemy on a horns of a dilemma

331
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,500
and it's essentially in this notion of

332
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,040
you know when I'm pursuing multiple uh

333
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,500
multiple types of attack at the same

334
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,459
time one of those types of attack uh in

335
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:51,899
order for you to defend against it

336
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,000
should make you vulnerable to something

337
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,320
else and my second attack should exploit

338
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,940
the fact that you're You're vulnerable

339
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,860
because of the first one right so

340
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,290
combined arms put your enemies

341
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,839
[Music]

342
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,600
right and then there's a counter attack

343
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,459
not a whole lot to say about this other

344
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:12,600
than

345
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,180
um you know there's basically uh kind of

346
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,100
a couple of key elements too which are

347
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,760
you know timing uh has to be a

348
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,579
counter-attack has to be

349
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:26,160
decisive and strong you really gotta you

350
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,019
know knock the opponent out like really

351
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,820
make sure that it's effective at the

352
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,220
point where you execute it and it has to

353
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,040
be well-timed you know that might seem

354
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,720
obvious like in order to be effective

355
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,700
you gotta Counter Strike just at the

356
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,360
right time but it's it's not just the

357
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,740
timing in order to make your connection

358
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,839
it's also the timing of making sure that

359
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,699
it's effective if you counter attack too

360
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,339
early you know that the enemy can

361
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,260
regroup and then you know hasn't really

362
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,120
had any impact right so you really got

363
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,279
to counter itself at the time where uh

364
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,139
you are able to completely knock them

365
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,760
off of their position and they're not

366
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,220
able to recover clients

367
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,360
okay

368
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,220
um so we move into an irregular warfare

369
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,100
as I said before uh this is really about

370
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,220
um small small units uh so this really

371
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,459
kind of burnout of the notion that

372
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:15,839
um you know people that are engaging in

373
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,220
this type of work there they have some

374
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,339
kind of material inferiority uh that

375
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,440
sort of forces them to engage this way

376
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,500
and uh because of the various benefits

377
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,060
that are gained from irregular warfare

378
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,699
it creates uh it disrupts the the

379
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:31,920
enemy's superiority Advantage assumption

380
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,860
right and so uh the three elements that

381
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,440
really define irregular warfare small

382
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,899
units gorilla tactics and long-term

383
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,820
commitment you'll jump into these real

384
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,220
quick the small units are really about

385
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,440
Stealth and speed right so you know I'm

386
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,620
looking to be able to move quickly uh

387
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,040
move covertly and attack and take

388
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,079
advantage of the sort of surprise attack

389
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,760
that comes from that

390
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,940
uh gorilla tactics things like robberies

391
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,399
acts of terrorism sabotage Etc

392
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,760
um basically basically unexpected

393
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,800
activities that that are going to catch

394
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,680
your adversary by Supply

395
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,779
gorilla actually to me like I think it's

396
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,279
probably just because of when I grew up

397
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,980
I when I heard that I initially thought

398
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,440
or immediately kind of directed my

399
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,720
thoughts towards uh like South America

400
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,760
and you know all the Guerrilla

401
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,620
activities that happened down there was

402
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,260
maybe through the Reagan Era right and

403
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,019
uh as I was doing some research on this

404
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,360
I found it actually is uh that term

405
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,639
originated from Spaniards uh in the

406
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,579
early 1800s who were defending uh Spain

407
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,220
against the Napoleonic forces that were

408
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,940
invading uh like Latino Florida to 1815

409
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,639
something like that so this has been

410
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,220
around for a really really long time

411
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,440
um specifically terms you know guerrilla

412
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,100
warfare since then uh and the one of the

413
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,740
you know sort of home marks of this is

414
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,079
that it's usually

415
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,420
it's usually an embedded Force that's

416
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,579
depending against some kind of invading

417
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,619
Force right and so I think there's you

418
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,179
know something interesting to take from

419
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,679
that

420
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,480
um because it's an embedded horse

421
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,880
there's an it's easy to have long-term

422
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,500
commitment for them right it's sort of

423
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,599
like you know live here uh you guys are

424
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,319
visiting I can do this all day and uh

425
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,359
how how long are your troops gonna

426
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,059
suffer from small Boot and and dysentery

427
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,799
before they're going to be ready to pack

428
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,559
it up and head home like as a small unit

429
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,020
I can go attack your supply line and be

430
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,960
back home uh having a warm meal and a

431
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,760
shower and sleeping in my own bed right

432
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,220
so I can really keep at this for a

433
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,780
really really long time that's kind of

434
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,940
the notion of the long-term commitment

435
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,520
behind this and again I think there's

436
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,440
some things to take away here as cyber

437
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,059
security Defenders right like they're

438
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,160
invading on our turf so

439
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,080
um you know we can we can get irregular

440
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,620
and have our our sponsor commitment is

441
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,140
is something that's relatively uh that's

442
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,179
that's sort of an advantage for us okay

443
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,580
the intelligence craft stuff I'm going

444
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,440
to blaze through this because you know

445
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,700
it's there

446
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,919
um we're kind of challenged on the cyber

447
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,600
security crime to actually carry out

448
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,480
every facet of this uh although it is

449
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,000
changing a little bit I've seen lately

450
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,700
in uh like Australian news the

451
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,200
government there is really talking about

452
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,480
well sort of uncorking things in terms

453
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,299
of allowing Defenders to attack back

454
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,460
that they're like or hacked back if

455
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,200
they're attackers this is generally not

456
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,480
something that's been allowed or or

457
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,640
acceptable in the industry up to this

458
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,580
point it's you know in consideration but

459
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,559
certainly that that kind of limits how

460
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,000
far we could go with an intelligence

461
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,640
craft it's basically you know these

462
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,620
three things are over intelligence we

463
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,360
invest in intelligence and partner

464
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,340
intelligence and deception so overt

465
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,620
intelligence

466
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,480
we commonly in the industry call it OS

467
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,280
inch right open source intelligence

468
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,919
because we're marketing people and we

469
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,600
like to Rebrand things in the cyber

470
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,220
security industry I guess but it's been

471
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,840
around for a really long design it was

472
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,120
called over intelligence this is

473
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,919
basically anything that's publicly

474
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,679
accessible I thought it was interesting

475
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,720
just you know in my research around this

476
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,600
like them the practitioners that really

477
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,220
engage in this kind of stuff don't even

478
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,160
go so far as observing like plays you

479
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,500
know reading novels that are abused by

480
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,380
whatever the target adversary is because

481
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,440
they're or the target country because it

482
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,100
informs uh sort of the state of popular

483
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,140
culture in the region right so there's

484
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,240
just really nothing is up when it's when

485
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,460
it comes to owner intelligences at the

486
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,860
end of the day when it comes down to

487
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,320
um so clandestine intelligence you know

488
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,059
simplest and it's just well well

489
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,580
concealed reconnaissance right so um

490
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,120
basically adversary puts up a series of

491
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,520
um blockades and you're trying to work

492
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,020
through those blockades to get access to

493
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,520
information that you shouldn't otherwise

494
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,880
be able to have uh and then the

495
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,419
counterintelligence your counter

496
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,220
Espionage and deception kind of too

497
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,980
south of the same coin uh if you're if

498
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,500
you're engaging in one uh we probably

499
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,720
are you know if you're doing it if

500
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,559
you're doing any kind of

501
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,120
counterintelligence you're really trying

502
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,580
to determine who's uh going through the

503
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,500
process of trying to get Intelligence on

504
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,559
you and while you're while you're

505
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,240
determined Excuse me while you're

506
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,919
determining that you are probably

507
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,039
engaging in some degree of deception to

508
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,919
um you know give them a

509
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,620
sort of the wrong direction to go right

510
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,280
um

511
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,160
and and get them get them off the off

512
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,660
the set everyone

513
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,600
okay so we're gonna shift gears here for

514
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,520
a second we're talking about Game Theory

515
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,799
um not to trivialize work where the game

516
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,980
theory is something that's applied to uh

517
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,320
to Warfare strategy and has been for a

518
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,360
long time uh and there's some aspects of

519
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,700
it that make a lot of sense uh and we'll

520
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,460
come back to the Warfare uh sort of

521
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,559
comparison here in a minute but

522
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,000
um just to give you a quick kind of

523
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,280
background on the aspect of game theory

524
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,320
that I think is very applicable here is

525
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,539
uh this concept of finite games versus

526
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,580
infinite games and so

527
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,440
um Game Theory basically says if there

528
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,000
are two players a game exists right so

529
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,380
if you're talking about any kind of

530
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,240
warfare scenario like there's usually

531
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,940
opponents engaged uh in in operations

532
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,980
against one another so that kind of

533
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,440
implies that a game exists all right so

534
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,740
finite game is uh basically you know the

535
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,299
games that we're all familiar with games

536
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,100
we've played as kids games we watch on

537
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,700
TV uh there are known players uh a fixed

538
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,380
set of ovals are agreed upon set of

539
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,120
rules and basically an agreed upon

540
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,580
objectives or or outcome and you know

541
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,120
some particular you know phase of the

542
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,740
game is reached and whoever gets their

543
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,559
first wins or whoever has the most uh

544
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,940
after a certain period of time or

545
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,980
whatever wins that's basically the

546
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,080
concept of defining planning game right

547
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,480
whereas an infinite game is a

548
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,159
combination of known and unknown players

549
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,200
so you may not necessarily be aware of

550
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,059
all the participants that are involved

551
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:03,120
there are no agreed upon rules and the

552
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,679
objective because there are no agreed

553
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,299
upon rules there's also no agreed upon

554
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,820
objective which basically means that the

555
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,320
primary objective is just a Perpetual

556
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,880
with the game right to keep the game

557
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,340
going uh and a good example of this is

558
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,679
politics right so politics we might not

559
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,720
necessarily think of as a game and even

560
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,460
if you do you might look at the surface

561
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,200
of it and think of it like a finite game

562
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,179
which is you know somebody's attempting

563
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,100
to win an election and so that feels

564
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,260
like a very finite game sort of scenario

565
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,820
right but if you kind of peel the onion

566
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,539
back once you'd find is uh well there

567
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,700
are known and unknown participants the

568
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,100
person engaging in the election uh you

569
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,200
know or attempting to get elected may be

570
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,000
the known participants but there are a

571
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,380
bunch of people under the scenes there's

572
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,179
behind the scenes that are supporting me

573
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,799
right and uh the rules are kind of you

574
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,539
know there may be some surface level

575
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,820
rules but uh you know behind the scenes

576
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,039
again it's sort of No No Holds Barred

577
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,860
right like you uh you try to entrap your

578
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,780
adversaries and Scandals or cover

579
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,400
scandals to make them look bad right

580
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,100
there's all this other Superfluous stuff

581
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,260
going on that has nothing to do with the

582
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,419
election whatsoever and that's kind of

583
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,059
what makes this a an infinite game and

584
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,700
then you know the objective of

585
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,720
perpetuating the game it's not just

586
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,400
about winning the election it's about

587
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,340
staying elected it's about staying in

588
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,679
office carrying out a secondary agenda

589
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,200
that may not necessarily be uh even

590
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
related to The Campaign that you're in

591
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,559
on right so

592
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,840
um really really good example politics

593
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,700
is is absolutely amazing at the

594
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,860
beginning so why am I going through this

595
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,960
well there's this concept called game

596
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,600
equilibrium which is if you have two

597
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,820
players engaging in the same the game

598
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,980
you basically get equilibrium out of

599
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,720
that so you've got a finite game player

600
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,240
up against a finite game player there

601
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,860
will be balance you're okay in that

602
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,240
situation

603
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,159
if you have someone engaging and what

604
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,539
they know is to be an infinite game

605
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,460
against an opponent that understands

606
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,140
their engaging in an infinite game then

607
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,900
again you have equilibrium

608
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,020
but when you engage in a game where you

609
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,120
know one opponent is understanding that

610
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,559
it's an Innovative thing that the other

611
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,880
opponent thinks they're playing a fine

612
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,059
art game now you get imbalance right and

613
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,400
this uh generally speaking creates an

614
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,980
advantage for the player engaging in an

615
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,840
intimate game and the reason for that is

616
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,820
very simply they're not constrained by

617
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,679
the same set of rules that the finite

618
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,740
gameplay right they're not looking for

619
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,260
the types of objectives or outcomes the

620
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,539
fun idea of what I was looking for

621
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,419
okay so bringing this back uh to the

622
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,880
Warfare strategy aspect of it

623
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,640
um you basically have this concept of

624
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,559
warfare equilibrium sorry I didn't

625
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,799
realize

626
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,580
um

627
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,320
at least a little bit uh so you have the

628
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,059
same kind of thing that exists with with

629
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:51,000
Warfare equilibrium right which is

630
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,820
um at the point where

631
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,460
you have somebody uh two two opponents

632
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,580
engaging in attrition Warfare uh you

633
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,020
know they're basically Force against

634
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,679
force uh and you know it's kind of a

635
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,659
little bit of a coin saucer he's going

636
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,159
to come out ahead right and you know

637
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,080
whose guns are bigger who has more of

638
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,360
them whatever but generally speaking you

639
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,880
have you have equilibrium but when you

640
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,200
have somebody engaging in attrition

641
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,640
Warfare against an opponent that's

642
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,280
engaging in maneuver Warfare uh now

643
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,039
you've got an imbalance here right and

644
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,260
again in this scenario I would call the

645
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,820
attrition rewards where sort of a finite

646
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,380
game and the maneuver Warfare and the

647
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,700
internet game right because they're

648
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,400
engaging uh in a battle where you know

649
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,220
the rules are different or non-existent

650
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,740
as far as you know the intuition Warfare

651
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,740
operators sort of expectations are that

652
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,419
things need to be a certain way and I'm

653
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,279
an Uber Warfare operators are going to

654
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:46,500
undermine those expectations effectively

655
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,380
but again somebody engaging a newer

656
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,820
Warfare against someone engaging in

657
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,919
irregular warfare

658
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,500
uh you sort of have the same situation

659
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,720
right which is uh there are more

660
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,240
expectations in place for those uh

661
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,159
operating maneuver Warfare fewer

662
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,960
expectations you know kind of Break The

663
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,000
Rules into regular Warfare and instantly

664
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,279
given advantages as a result I didn't

665
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,020
put it up here because it just made the

666
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,480
slide a little too busy but uh well if

667
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,919
you had you know integration Warfare

668
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,360
against the regular Warfare it would be

669
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,919
to something like a regular Warfare

670
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,779
would have an advantage over the

671
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,419
traditional Warfare

672
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,840
um so I go through all of this

673
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,059
because bringing it back to cyber

674
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,720
security I've seen for years that you

675
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,740
know we're pretty much playing an

676
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,200
attrition Warfare game as cyber security

677
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,600
Defenders right um I mean how many folks

678
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,320
have heard about an operation where uh

679
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,820
they have some kind of rule in place

680
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,080
where they're going to touch every

681
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,480
single high and critical security alert

682
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,620
that comes into the Sim right

683
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,240
I swear like I used to work for a sin

684
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,919
vendor and we had customers that did

685
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,080
this is talking about literally 200

686
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,960
million events a day and maybe 20 of

687
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,059
them were you know high in critical

688
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,520
severity and somebody had to touch every

689
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,779
single one of those things so that's a

690
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:04,799
traditional worker all right like

691
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,299
that'll make you want to go throw

692
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,760
yourself in front of your own guns right

693
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,360
like this exhausting nobody wants to do

694
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,120
that but you know it's it's that kind of

695
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,940
I'll say

696
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,039
limited creativity stuff that has sort

697
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,840
of plagued Us in this industry for a

698
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,360
really really long time now if we're

699
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,520
gonna you know really kind of subscribed

700
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,640
it as Warfare cyber security Warfare

701
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,559
approach then you know we can take

702
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,200
advantage of some of these other

703
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,059
well-established uh Warfare Concepts to

704
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,460
to enable us to be more effective so

705
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,140
let's talk about what an ideal strategy

706
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,779
is there is some aspect of attrition

707
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:46,020
warfare that's useful uh it's the my

708
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,340
guns are bigger than yours and I have

709
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,500
more of them aspect of it at least you

710
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,299
know be the be the team with the most

711
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,220
effective weapons on the on the

712
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,539
battlefield right there's definitely

713
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,000
some benefit to that the highly

714
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,640
effective weapons uh wielded in an

715
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,679
Adaptive manner so some element of

716
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,419
maneuver Warfare incorporated into this

717
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,340
right we'll get it in an Adaptive

718
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,620
manager manner targeting the enemy's

719
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,740
gaps using unexpected tactics with

720
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,419
launch and focus right so really what

721
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,200
we're doing is drawing from aspects of

722
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,000
all of the different Warfare strategies

723
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,940
and kind of making them uh making them

724
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,159
work to our benefit in a manner that

725
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,320
presents the most strategic advantage so

726
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,760
it's a little bit of everything

727
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,340
so we're going to dive into how we

728
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,960
actually carry this out and by the way

729
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,279
it should all be informed by

730
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,960
intelligence as I said before we're

731
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,400
probably going to be limited to like the

732
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,500
overt intelligence kinds of stuff

733
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,880
but we'll actually go through an

734
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,380
exercise here that I think falls into

735
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,880
that

736
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,539
um

737
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,120
into the highly effective weapons and

738
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,600
and informed by intelligence elements

739
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,860
so I chose deep Panda black black Vine

740
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,559
as a threat actor that we can dive into

741
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,600
and actually put this to work in a

742
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,299
practical sense uh these guys I'll give

743
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,820
you a quick overview of this that actor

744
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,760
they've been active since 2012 maybe not

745
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,980
as active anymore but there's a lot of

746
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,580
information out there about the types of

747
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,559
ttps and the activities that they were

748
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,600
engaged in and whatnot so it's really

749
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,200
good really good reference example for

750
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,299
this for this process or this exercise

751
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:24,179
for us to go through so their targets

752
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,159
are commonly targeting energy government

753
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,059
defense Health Care Financial travel

754
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,840
telecommunications and their motive

755
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,820
thought is generally Espionage at least

756
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,320
we know that to be the case now we

757
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,159
didn't necessarily back in 2012 to 2000

758
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,059
call it 15. we didn't know that but

759
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,159
uh their most noteworthy event was

760
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,260
Anthem health so if you guys remember it

761
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,520
Improvement in health in one of the

762
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,679
largest Health insurers in the country

763
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,320
at the time back in around February 2015

764
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,419
it was originally reported that they

765
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,399
were breached uh 80 million patient

766
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,520
records exposed so really big deal uh

767
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,460
and common findings basically they used

768
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,460
Watering Hole attacks uh with zero day

769
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,220
exploits and they use custom developed

770
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,919
malware that they frequently updated uh

771
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,320
in order to bypass sequences you know

772
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,320
and just generally be very effective

773
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,020
there's a lot of information about these

774
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,140
guys and uh this Source reference that I

775
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,260
have up here it's um this was one of the

776
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,020
early investigations into the Anthem

777
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,419
health breach was produced by John

778
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,419
DiMaggio while he was at Symantec so

779
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,340
this is the report that he created on

780
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,360
that

781
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,159
um against semantics more owned by

782
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,919
Brockton so that's where they'll find it

783
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:43,559
so let's dive into their ttbs I have the

784
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,659
TTP numbers on here the minor attack

785
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,940
framework numbers on here don't worry

786
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,260
about trying to keep track of all of

787
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,960
this I'm actually going to make this

788
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,279
presentation available for for everybody

789
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,919
when you're done here but

790
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,980
um just for understanding the types of

791
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,779
activities that they engaged in how they

792
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,700
accomplished what they were doing uh

793
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,159
we're talking about basically either

794
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,440
using spear phishing or drive-by

795
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,720
downloaded you know Watering Hole

796
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,820
attacks for their initial access so

797
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,679
these are the compromised ttps by the

798
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,240
way like the pre-coming models and

799
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,820
compromise stuff basically using spear

800
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,460
fishing drive-by downloads Etc uh and

801
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,440
then several defensive Asian techniques

802
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,840
in order to bypass uh you know your

803
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,539
basic antivirus or EDR defenses back

804
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,120
then EDR wasn't quite as advanced as it

805
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,279
is now so maybe doing some really basic

806
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,960
things like uh using legitimate

807
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,580
certificates to design their malicious

808
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,100
code and things in that nature and I

809
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,080
mentioned they've often updated their

810
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,840
malware uh and ordered a bypass the

811
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,220
fences because they'd go figure out what

812
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,279
my indicators the antivirus vendors were

813
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,320
using to detect their scope and then

814
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,299
just remove that or change it into our

815
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,580
code and reissue it and go after another

816
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,700
Target right so constantly constantly

817
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,340
evolving their stuff

818
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,580
uh so along with uh these you know the

819
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,100
ttps in Black were things that I was

820
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,740
able to find definitively uh have been

821
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,419
reported about this threat actor the

822
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:15,659
ones in red are kind of implied right so

823
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:17,580
in order for them to be able to carry

824
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,799
out this initial access and defensive

825
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,840
agent stuff they had to have engaged in

826
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,480
some kind of reconnaissance right so I

827
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,640
pulled in those ttps as well they likely

828
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,960
had to spend some time gathering

829
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,240
information about their uh their victim

830
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,240
the victims organization the victims

831
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,100
identities that they went after they

832
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,140
used resources like open websites

833
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,240
domains to technical Publications

834
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,580
whatever uh they needed to use in order

835
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,320
to grab these and in some cases the last

836
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,760
one in red they're fishing for

837
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,799
information you know it's very likely

838
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,659
that an adversary like this is going to

839
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:53,580
use phishing and actually get you know

840
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,640
some kind of information elicited out of

841
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,960
the environment that they wouldn't

842
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,679
normally have access to the fishing name

843
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,020
may not be to actually initially

844
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,419
compromise the environment it's just you

845
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,380
know trying to get a better

846
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,940
understanding of how things operate

847
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,460
right so really common for that sort of

848
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,080
thing workplace

849
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,179
um moving on to the post-compromise fit

850
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:17,100
uh this might be a little bit hard to

851
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,019
read but I'll walk through it in detail

852
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,039
so

853
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,720
um the first aspect of it is command and

854
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,399
control so these guys are known to use

855
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,200
web-based protocols for their command

856
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,840
and control processes and protocols uh

857
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,880
their malware is communicating over each

858
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,380
to a command and control server over

859
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,320
HTTP or https so they try to blend in

860
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,039
our traffic they use Powershell so that

861
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,860
the second category is execution they've

862
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,019
been known to use Powershell scripting

863
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,840
in order to carry out various aspects of

864
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,460
that campaign

865
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,480
um they are using various defensive

866
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,059
managing techniques uh one specific

867
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,159
example that was called out is just the

868
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,779
fact that they're while they're using

869
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,059
Powershell they're hiding hiding windows

870
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,760
that they're executing this stuff in but

871
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,700
I'm sure it's not limited to that they

872
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,980
use various privilege escalation and

873
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,820
persistence tactics so one example was

874
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,159
given they're using this process called

875
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,619
sticky keys associated with remote

876
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,659
desktop protocols so

877
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,000
um you're basically able to get access

878
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,899
to a machine that's authenticated to the

879
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,480
RDP by by using the sticky keys and

880
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,199
capturing the credentials or bypassing

881
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,659
the relying about

882
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,060
um and in a lateral movement bit they've

883
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,199
been known to use Windows admin shares

884
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,859
in order to find information that

885
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,418
ultimately they've been used to move

886
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,918
laterally with

887
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,339
um so they'll uh you're like Bill crawl

888
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,619
shares you know get maybe flying

889
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:55,320
credentials things like that and then

890
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,420
they're also known to use for uh

891
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,859
additional aspects of lateral movement

892
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,839
they're going to use wdmi so Windows

893
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,720
Dimensions we don't you know use that to

894
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,940
execute code remotely on other machines

895
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,339
inside of the environment and then

896
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,900
collection is you know sort of the

897
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,280
obvious thing they're they're going to

898
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,540
find the data they're after and they're

899
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,440
going to collect it they're going to

900
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,300
spill it

901
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,160
okay so

902
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,839
um kind of breaking this down even a

903
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,660
little bit further than the the ttps are

904
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,839
red here again are sort of the implied

905
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:26,940
things so in order for them to be

906
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,820
effective at uh privilege escalation

907
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,700
persistence lateral movement all of this

908
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,380
stuff they were going to have to do some

909
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,880
kind of Discovery editing environment

910
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,339
right so they had to do uh network

911
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,680
service discovery account Discovery

912
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,480
Network share Discovery these sorts of

913
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,119
things and ultimately

914
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,619
in the anthem case an open breach uh the

915
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,780
way that that their presence was

916
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,640
discovered was because a database

917
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,099
administrator had seen a series of

918
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,260
queries issued against the database that

919
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,260
were new that came from his

920
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,780
credentialism you know his credentials

921
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,579
were used to execute this query but he

922
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,920
knew that he did not perform this action

923
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,480
and so that was kind of the thing that

924
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,180
that surfaced him for them

925
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,240
um the implication there is you know the

926
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,920
attack didn't start with that individual

927
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,780
so somehow they got that individual's

928
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,280
credentials in order to be able to give

929
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,320
access to this database and ultimately

930
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,599
pull the data put in question out of it

931
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,859
right so

932
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,079
um so again we don't know exactly how

933
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,119
the credential access took place but we

934
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,420
know that they had to do something there

935
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,040
okay so

936
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,800
um we walked through the tcps let's

937
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,680
let's pull this back then to

938
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,420
um the Warfare strategies right like

939
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,880
basically all of this stuff maps to

940
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,500
minimum War experience I mean like I

941
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,240
look at this I'm like okay these are all

942
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,520
tactics or techniques that that align

943
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,440
with minimum Warfare

944
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,119
um and I can put you know the various

945
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,859
things that we talked about with minimum

946
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,380
Warfare to this so uh all the

947
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,119
requirements and stuff that qualifies as

948
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,940
a Recon poll uh all of the initial

949
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,099
access and execution stuff that's your

950
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,599
focus of effort right that's the short

951
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,920
font uh and the specific youth tools

952
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,339
that they use to evade defenses that all

953
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,619
falls into the Firepower category

954
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:18,599
right so we can move that's on the

955
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,640
compromise side let's move back to the

956
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,920
post compromise stuff and again we're

957
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,140
looking at a bunch of mini reward Fair

958
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,640
tactics here

959
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,380
um basically all of that command and

960
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,380
control execution uh defensive Asian and

961
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,480
that is all stuff that that falls into

962
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,660
the the Firepower category uh Discovery

963
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,480
internal Discovery is again your recon

964
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,770
poll activity

965
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,760
[Music]

966
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,280
privilege escalation and persistence uh

967
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
lateral movement that's your focus of

968
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,000
effort again

969
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,780
that the second set of execution stuff

970
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,820
and when there's instrumentation uh

971
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,460
which is the wmi activity falls into the

972
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,680
Firepower category uh and then

973
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,740
credential access is Recon hole again uh

974
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,960
and your collection is the short prompt

975
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,720
so you can basically go through you know

976
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,820
all of the ttps that you can pull out

977
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,720
for an attacker uh and and some set of

978
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,540
well-known you know events that they or

979
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,880
attacks that they've uh participated in

980
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,440
you can go through this process of

981
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,660
pulling these ttps out and then

982
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,460
assigning them to the various end of the

983
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,859
Warfare or irregular warfare categories

984
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:30,660
and I'll say in in the case of this

985
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,280
threat actor there's not really a whole

986
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,200
lot from in a regular Warfare standpoint

987
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,359
but if you're to look at some of the

988
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,880
current threat actors that are you know

989
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,339
Revel or the popular ones that are

990
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:42,960
engaging in ransomware stuff that

991
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,780
definitely falls into a regular Warfare

992
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,599
category right when you look at some of

993
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,460
the stuff that's Russia is pulling on

994
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,280
the Ukraine with

995
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,079
you know destructive malware the lifers

996
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,339
and things like that that definitely

997
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:57,780
falls into the irregular warfare

998
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,520
category right so

999
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,800
um all of this stuff is uh highly

1000
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,040
applicable from a Warfare standpoint

1001
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,839
um talking about attribution for a

1002
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:10,800
second uh this basically at the time

1003
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,740
when this was initially reported some of

1004
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,780
the early research took place they

1005
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,339
basically concluded that there's an

1006
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:20,040
organization run out of Beijing China

1007
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,560
called topsack that they were able to

1008
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,079
attribute a lot of this activity back to

1009
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:27,060
it was based on domains that were

1010
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,680
registered certificates that were

1011
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,940
created there was a lot of information

1012
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,640
that they were able to to leverage to

1013
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,500
you know kind of work their way back to

1014
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,540
the top SEC being that that entity

1015
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,440
associated with this and initially

1016
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,720
everybody thought that this was a

1017
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,940
criminal act that it was monetarily

1018
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,540
motivated but it turned out after you

1019
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,060
know a bit more Discovery you know

1020
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,099
suddenly coming back to like the

1021
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,720
overview where we were talking about the

1022
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,420
targets uh there's you know a big swath

1023
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,700
of targets that uh that are involved

1024
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,579
with this particular threat actor and

1025
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,200
um when they really started to

1026
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,500
understand stand how this information

1027
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:12,359
was exposed could be used it became

1028
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:13,980
clear that this was in Espionage

1029
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,339
oriented event right and one of the

1030
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:21,000
things that was material about this uh

1031
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,440
The Anthem health breach was really

1032
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,880
interesting from the standpoint that

1033
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,579
Anthem health was one of the the health

1034
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:32,160
insurers that was contracted to the U.S

1035
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,220
government to do

1036
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,480
a lot of stuff for our government

1037
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,599
employees right in particular the CIA

1038
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,040
was using them basically to carry out

1039
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,040
things like physicals and health checks

1040
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,160
and whatnot and so this information they

1041
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,020
were able to cross-reference with travel

1042
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,720
records and basically get very detailed

1043
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,140
information about who was moving through

1044
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,180
Africa Europe and Asia that were

1045
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,839
basically CIA operatives right and so

1046
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,460
um you know when you when you think

1047
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:08,820
about what we're doing as Defenders

1048
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,820
working for a company like Anthem health

1049
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,440
you know we're civilians working for

1050
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,359
what seems like a civilian organization

1051
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,880
and yet uh you know they're embroiled in

1052
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,400
this this spiderweb basically of

1053
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,640
Espionage that's being used to carry out

1054
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,400
a nation-state motivated attack right so

1055
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,160
really really interesting stuff and I'll

1056
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,079
also say all those ttps that we went

1057
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,640
through even if you're looking at a

1058
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,000
criminal threat actor they're basically

1059
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,180
using the same tactics so you know it

1060
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,280
would be the equivalent of

1061
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,839
you know somebody

1062
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,480
like this monetarily motivated robbing a

1063
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,520
bank but you know they're robbing a bank

1064
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,619
with with weapons of mass destruction

1065
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,540
and that typically right as opposed to

1066
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,680
you know handguns like this is the

1067
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,180
equivalency that's that's happening

1068
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,359
right now and so you know to look at the

1069
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,160
the criminal threat actors and say like

1070
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,660
oh well they're just motivated for money

1071
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,040
that's not going to be Warfare but if

1072
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,020
they're using the same tactics that

1073
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,119
nation state threat actors are using

1074
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:14,880
then I don't know how you discount that

1075
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,160
right it's it's basically the same

1076
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,720
strategy so you've got to defend against

1077
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,839
it the same way so coming back to uh the

1078
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,760
highly effective are the ideal strategy

1079
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,020
for a second

1080
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,359
um I'm going to skip past the first two

1081
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,940
and um really kind of focus on the last

1082
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,220
three uh and then we'll recap so

1083
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,460
targeting the enemies gaps well how do

1084
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,200
you figure out what the enemy's surfaces

1085
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,900
and gaps are uh well the way I look at

1086
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,359
this is adversaries have an advantage

1087
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,040
when they have moderate to significant

1088
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,680
knowledge and moderate significant

1089
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,260
control

1090
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,579
opposite to that or at a disadvantage

1091
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:52,079
when they have limited knowledge and

1092
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,300
limited control so we can actually use

1093
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,900
that little you know uh sort of uh

1094
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,480
awareness or insight to figure out where

1095
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,760
those services and gaps exist so let's

1096
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,440
go through a quick exercise break it

1097
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,540
down on these ptps we looked at it from

1098
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,000
a from a Warfare strategy sample or a

1099
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,980
maneuver Warfare like Recon full versus

1100
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,220
Firepower Etc let's let's break it down

1101
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,740
throughout surfaces on the apps

1102
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,900
perspective well when you look at the

1103
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,660
reconnaissance bit here

1104
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,000
if you ask yourself well do they have a

1105
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,380
moderate to significant knowledge

1106
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,300
moderates a significant control the

1107
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,339
answer on the recount side is no they

1108
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,760
don't so that's a gap for them right

1109
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,040
whereas the initial access stuff you

1110
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,720
know generally speaking they know how

1111
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,460
their malware is going to execute they

1112
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,079
know how your defenses are going to

1113
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,000
respond to it because they've tested all

1114
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,440
of that stuff right they have the

1115
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,560
ability to you know test and value these

1116
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,940
things and so they have a moderate

1117
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,460
degree of control there and knowledge

1118
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,380
right so that would be a service

1119
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,480
same thing with the defensive Asian

1120
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,819
stuff they know how to Avail defenses

1121
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:58,319
they know code signing is going to be

1122
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,119
effective right so they've got a

1123
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:02,160
moderate degree of knowledge and control

1124
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,619
over this so that makes that a service

1125
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:07,319
on the post compromise side again the

1126
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:09,300
command and control aspect definitely a

1127
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,619
service surface the reason I say that

1128
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:15,300
you know it might seem like well they're

1129
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,859
controlling something inside the

1130
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:19,680
environment that that they don't have

1131
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,900
direct access to so their control is

1132
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,300
limited the interesting aspect of this

1133
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,520
is and we talk about this a lot at my

1134
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,260
employer actually

1135
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,839
um when an adversary is commanded

1136
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:32,819
controlling a remote machine through

1137
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:35,760
malware that they they've developed

1138
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,880
they actually control both sides of that

1139
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,040
communication from the standpoint of how

1140
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,720
the malware communicates they're looking

1141
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,520
at a mutual server right or how they're

1142
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,380
implant you don't have to call it

1143
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,540
malware Hunter implant communicates with

1144
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,800
the command and control server they're

1145
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,440
controlling whether it uses HTTP httws

1146
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,319
maybe it uses a slack API maybe it uses

1147
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,780
a Microsoft graphql API like they're

1148
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,520
really doing a lot to blend their

1149
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,099
traffic in uh with your with your normal

1150
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,900
everyday traffic right so they've got

1151
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,720
maximum control there basically and they

1152
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,520
know exactly how those Protocols are

1153
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,960
going to behave they know exactly how

1154
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,480
their implant is going to behave in

1155
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,339
terms of communication so again all

1156
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,859
surfaces that the command and control

1157
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:18,780
the execution of defensive Asian all

1158
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,359
services but this discovery bit that's a

1159
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,220
gap for them they have limited knowledge

1160
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,900
of your environment and limited control

1161
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,000
of your environment right so this is

1162
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,440
actually pretty obvious they've got to

1163
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,300
go do some network discovery some

1164
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,859
account Discovery whatever they have to

1165
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:34,380
do uh to really dig that that

1166
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,900
information out

1167
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,180
um privilege escalation and persistence

1168
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,040
lateral movement again all the same

1169
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,599
stuff they know when these things are

1170
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:43,980
going to execute they know what they're

1171
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,720
expecting it to do so that's a service

1172
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,180
uh their execution the same thing that's

1173
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,280
a surface the credential access that's

1174
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,660
another Gap they don't know your

1175
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,520
credentials in your environment right so

1176
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,040
they've got to go figure that out

1177
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,800
the last limo collection

1178
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,260
um that one is also a gap where it's

1179
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,119
it's something that I called like the

1180
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,099
short pumped earlier when we were going

1181
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,960
through the the manure Warfare

1182
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,520
designations

1183
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,740
um but when it comes to actually

1184
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,260
determining where the data is in your

1185
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,880
environment and they need to pull out

1186
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,520
and the process of accessing and pulling

1187
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,260
out that data is something that's going

1188
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,300
to expose them right so that again

1189
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,960
becomes a gap for the energy again going

1190
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,640
back to what I said before limited

1191
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,880
knowledge limited control and data

1192
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,160
collection as a aspect you're not really

1193
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,660
having at least limited knowledge about

1194
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,480
the data itself

1195
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,619
okay so

1196
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:39,540
um how do you target the enemy's gaps

1197
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,700
well uh we just kind of broke it down

1198
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,040
like basically the the enemy has to

1199
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,599
figure out where do things of value

1200
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,460
reside so they're going to network port

1201
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,200
scan internally they're going to share

1202
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,060
scan internally

1203
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,619
um you know it used to be a thing like

1204
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:55,380
back when I started in a sock we were

1205
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,599
looking at court scans from the outside

1206
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,819
like people put scanning our perimeter

1207
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:01,800
and eventually everybody stopped paying

1208
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,480
attention to that because yeah if you're

1209
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,740
connected to the internet you're going

1210
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,560
to get Port stained like oh well right

1211
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,900
it doesn't really serve much useful

1212
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,260
information right but but internally are

1213
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,180
you watching for Port scans inside your

1214
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,859
network because it's actually not very

1215
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:19,380
common for that to happen yeah your

1216
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,060
vulnerability scanner is going to do it

1217
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,980
domain controllers will do something

1218
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,599
that looks like when it's scanning

1219
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,400
occasionally but it generally speaking

1220
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,440
is pretty easy to put a few exclusions

1221
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,500
in place and then identify significantly

1222
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,020
anomalous behavior of that that is point

1223
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,540
scanning oriented

1224
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,819
Etc then they've got to ask answer the

1225
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:40,800
question who has who has access to

1226
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,300
things of value so they're going to do

1227
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,579
ldap queries that Duncan fire active

1228
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,260
directory donating right they're going

1229
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,200
to run excessive RPC cards to figure out

1230
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,060
where those users that have access to

1231
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,880
stuff of value or logged into and so

1232
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,800
there's really easy things that you can

1233
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,319
do to identify this kind of behavior

1234
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,460
that is

1235
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,980
not common in most environments like

1236
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,780
yeah lots of ldap queries might be

1237
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,339
happening but there aren't very many

1238
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,200
ldap queries where somebody is dumping

1239
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,640
the entire active directory building

1240
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,440
there's not very many where people are

1241
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,480
filtering specifically for members of

1242
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,220
the building address or some other

1243
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,680
admins group right so these are things

1244
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,440
that are relatively easy to spot uh and

1245
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,660
then the last one there what are the

1246
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,819
credentials for those who run out who

1247
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:25,800
have access right they're going to have

1248
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,420
to do something to get access to those

1249
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,760
credentials so whether they're scraping

1250
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,680
files looking for credentials stored in

1251
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,079
a file or using kerberosting registry

1252
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,160
Hive dumping LSS sales lsas prop uh

1253
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,839
dumping stuff

1254
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,680
um all of that activity is uh is

1255
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,839
relatively easy to spot because it's

1256
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,819
it's abnormal

1257
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:49,619
and so

1258
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:51,540
um jumping into the using unexpected

1259
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,119
tactics that you know set triple items

1260
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:55,500
this is where our opportunity to be

1261
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,540
deceptive comes in we can take advantage

1262
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,760
of the effect that our adversary doesn't

1263
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,800
know much about our environment so

1264
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,079
create an open admin share call it an

1265
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,000
admin share right but make it accessible

1266
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,460
to lots of folks uh and number power

1267
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,900
Channel script in there with valid

1268
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,579
credentials you know make sure that

1269
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:12,960
those valid credentials don't have

1270
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,200
access to much and then go put a sorry

1271
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,300
about that go put a um go put a rule in

1272
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,700
place that that alerts the whole world

1273
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,800
basically when those credentials get

1274
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,599
used right this is a very very simple

1275
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,700
thing to do that the adversary we know

1276
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,740
they're looking for credentials so given

1277
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,420
the credentials we want them to have

1278
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,760
right uh and trip them up with that make

1279
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,920
them expose themselves create a

1280
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,660
sensitive folder and SharePoint and put

1281
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,280
a bunch of fake documents in it and look

1282
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,020
for people accessing those specific

1283
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,660
documents in in Mass right put a 100

1284
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,520
documents in there if somebody's

1285
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,680
touching all of those things it's very

1286
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,760
likely somebody that doesn't know how

1287
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,940
anything about your environment right

1288
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,260
and you can do the same thing on the

1289
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,880
database side like go into a production

1290
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,800
database and put a fake table in there

1291
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,660
make it a really complicated table with

1292
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,880
a bunch of data in it and see who's

1293
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,920
interacting with it right

1294
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,300
um there's a point where somebody goes

1295
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,280
in doesn't describe on that table or

1296
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,079
queries that table you know something is

1297
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,780
up right and when I talk to people about

1298
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:12,060
this they their instant reaction is like

1299
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,920
well you know what about it just a

1300
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,900
curious Insider that's like browsing

1301
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,819
around it like first off if you've got a

1302
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,500
curious Insider that goes and finds a

1303
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,880
Powershell script and pulls the

1304
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,000
credentials out of it and uses them

1305
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,500
I'm going to be highly suspicious about

1306
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,359
the motivations of that Insider right

1307
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,280
like that's that's pretty questionable

1308
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,099
Behavior but you know what go work with

1309
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:33,599
the department heads anyway go to the

1310
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,480
HRT and vlr cape on your HR server we're

1311
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,040
going to put a folder in here with some

1312
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,500
with some sensitive data or suppose it's

1313
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,780
sensitive data in it right and and you

1314
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,160
know share the details with the team

1315
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,599
like give them a heads up let them know

1316
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:46,859
what you're doing and why you're doing

1317
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:47,760
it

1318
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,000
perfectly fine to just make sure they

1319
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,640
don't write it down somewhere that

1320
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,319
adversary is going to find right so that

1321
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:56,640
they know where all your trip wires are

1322
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,980
but uh but the point is that if you do

1323
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,380
this appropriately or effectively uh

1324
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,440
this is a very low false positive uh

1325
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,500
approach to getting that the adversary

1326
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,559
to trip up and expose themselves

1327
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,780
all right we're almost done here um the

1328
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,000
long-term Focus that I'm going to dive

1329
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,740
into this for a second so this is kind

1330
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,480
of you know what we talked about early

1331
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,880
on emphasize ownership Empower your team

1332
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,200
right

1333
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,980
um you know that the intentions over

1334
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,140
instructions stuff uh you you really

1335
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:31,200
gotta uh focus on building culture

1336
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,240
within an organization where you're

1337
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,680
trying to defend something because

1338
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,859
turnover is devastating right when you

1339
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:39,839
lose key members of your team your

1340
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,780
ability to replace those people uh is is

1341
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,640
really devastating and we have something

1342
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,240
like a an 18-month average uh turnover

1343
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,579
for employees in in this industry I

1344
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,920
think in a lot of scenarios it's

1345
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,599
actually closer to six months where

1346
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,400
people just get burnt out working in a

1347
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,200
sock or any kind of you know security

1348
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,540
engineering uh environment they get

1349
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,099
burned out really really quickly we need

1350
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,200
to extend that out to like you know a

1351
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,660
good organization we'll have people uh

1352
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,300
in in place for five years right like

1353
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,520
carrying all that tribal knowledge

1354
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,260
forward that's what we really should be

1355
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,760
striving for as an industry and the only

1356
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,280
way that's going to happen is keeping

1357
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,960
that long-term Focus you know building

1358
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,780
building a really really strong culture

1359
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,400
validate your technology and process but

1360
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,900
Embrace failure you know don't people

1361
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,140
don't beat people up for failing uh and

1362
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,599
celebrate uh people when they find

1363
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:32,640
failure if they've tested something and

1364
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,020
found that it didn't work you got to

1365
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,059
celebrate that right like really elevate

1366
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:38,640
it raise it up make sure everybody knows

1367
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,380
that this is something that we're really

1368
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,960
going to embrace and then create growth

1369
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,359
plans based on people's abilities if

1370
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,099
your growth plan and the organization

1371
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:50,099
revolves around tenure a time uh you're

1372
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:52,440
gonna you might get people that stick

1373
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,059
around for 18 months because they want

1374
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:57,180
to have you know some steady you know

1375
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,059
kind of uh work history on their on

1376
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:01,859
their resume right but they're not going

1377
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:03,300
to stick around much longer than that

1378
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,760
right so you got to focus on abilities

1379
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,920
and then train around those abilities

1380
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,359
that have built into your growth plan

1381
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,339
right so that you can give people not

1382
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:13,319
only here's what you need to do in order

1383
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:15,480
to excel in this organization but here's

1384
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,040
the here's the training we're going to

1385
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,420
give you to make sure that we've not

1386
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,000
been train on network fundamentals OS

1387
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,280
fundamentals architecture application

1388
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,319
all the fundamentals of the stuff that

1389
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:26,880
you really got to focus on it's not

1390
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,339
about uh training on on cyber security

1391
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,880
specific things how to how to attack how

1392
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,420
to identify attacks it's more about

1393
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,500
understanding the fundamentals really

1394
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,559
really well and those other instances

1395
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,540
will jump out at those people that

1396
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,220
understand those things right and then

1397
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,420
I'd say

1398
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,400
um that the last bit of this TTP is

1399
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,500
Services of gas go through that exercise

1400
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,420
that we just did right go through the

1401
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,819
process of identifying for a new threat

1402
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:56,160
actor that's you know in the news go

1403
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,780
find the information you can get about

1404
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,559
them document their ttps assign their

1405
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:03,839
you know uh miniature Warfare or

1406
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,940
irregular warfare designations to them

1407
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,220
figure out where their surfaces and gaps

1408
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,599
are you know if you're going through

1409
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,119
this process on a recurring basis you're

1410
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,619
going to get to know the adversary

1411
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:15,780
extremely well and you'll also know

1412
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:18,960
where your defenses have surfaces again

1413
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,680
gaps that either are adjacent to like

1414
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,780
you know kind of offline with their

1415
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,880
surfaces and gas or are in line with

1416
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,099
with their services and gaps right and

1417
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,380
uh and it'll just really set you up to

1418
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,380
uh to be the most effective the

1419
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,720
defending this as possibly can be so uh

1420
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,520
coming back to the ideal strategy we've

1421
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,160
got highly effective weapons well what

1422
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,559
is our most effective weapon inside of

1423
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,319
security is you right it's the

1424
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,079
individuals you know Buds and seats it's

1425
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:51,660
a very cerebral occupation right so it's

1426
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,940
really has to be you know the team that

1427
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,740
is maximally effective supported by

1428
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,140
tools that enable them to be uh

1429
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,300
expeditious that they're able to you

1430
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,000
know operate with speed and efficiency

1431
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,720
uh wheeled in an Adaptive manner is you

1432
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,940
know established intent over intention

1433
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,500
intentions over instructions so I can

1434
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,780
talk about right and the intent is you

1435
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,819
know we're going to try to limit our

1436
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:17,400
exposure and prevent or compromise as

1437
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,440
much as we possibly can but at the point

1438
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,480
where those defenses are going to get

1439
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,579
bypassed we really need to be effective

1440
00:55:23,579 --> 00:55:25,920
at post compromise detection so the

1441
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,359
things that we need to put in place in

1442
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,460
order to be able to identify an

1443
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,079
adversary once they find their way into

1444
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:33,000
the environment and then allow your team

1445
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,859
members to run through their own right

1446
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:36,960
allow them to observe Orient decide and

1447
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,059
act and tolerate the mistakes when they

1448
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:41,040
make them uh and then targeting the

1449
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,839
enemies gaps adverse areas are most

1450
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,760
exposed when doing the reconnaissance so

1451
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,099
those are their biggest gaps focus on

1452
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,200
ways to identify that and find that

1453
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,319
Behavior Uh using unexpected tactics set

1454
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,300
trip wires stage credentials fake

1455
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,280
Services make documents fake database

1456
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,099
Stables Etc with a long-term Focus

1457
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:00,900
certain like I said turnover is

1458
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,579
devastating build culture to return

1459
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:03,780
Talent

1460
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,200
okay these are all the references that I

1461
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,680
use and doing research for this uh this

1462
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,599
presentation I'm going to be you know

1463
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,339
building off of this presentation in a

1464
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:16,319
handful of ways diving in a little

1465
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,359
deeper to some aspects of it you know

1466
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:20,400
doing offshoots of it with various other

1467
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,500
sort of Concepts I have rattling around

1468
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,020
in my hand with

1469
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,180
semi-aligned with or adjacent to this so

1470
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,740
um anyway these these books will

1471
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,260
definitely be uh you know sources that

1472
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,700
are continue to reference over and over

1473
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,020
and over again

1474
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,960
um and the last bit is you know if you

1475
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,400
guys connect with me on LinkedIn or

1476
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,020
follow me on LinkedIn I'm going to share

1477
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,819
this presentation there so you'll be

1478
00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:44,099
able to get access to it there uh you

1479
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:47,220
can follow me on Twitter Mastodon

1480
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,740
having limited success with kind of sit

1481
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,240

sorry um

1495
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,359
please give it a favor for me and like

1496
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:27,660
repeat the fundamentals that your team

1497
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,420
needs to emphasize for a long-term

1498
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,640
playing when things like operating the

1499
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,759
system

1500
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:39,300
you watching a snapshot of that

1501
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,460
um yeah so basically

1502
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,339
you know this is this is coming from my

1503
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:45,839
own personal background I'm sort of

1504
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,579
biased around this like I started in

1505
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:50,099
networking and and systems engineering

1506
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,119
so

1507
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,500
um you know like

1508
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,660
the Havoc platform that I built for

1509
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,339
example I'm not a very good software

1510
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,020
developer but I just knew what I needed

1511
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,640
to accomplish from an engineering

1512
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,319
standpoint and I was able to piece

1513
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:03,059
things together right and that's a lot I

1514
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:04,619
think of what you do in cyber security

1515
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:06,960
was it just kind of follow the threads

1516
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,400
you know you grab a thread and you

1517
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,280
follow it and the only way you're really

1518
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,839
going to be able to follow this through

1519
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:14,640
is we have a really strong fundamentals

1520
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,140
to work off of so

1521
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,599
that's that's really kind of what what

1522
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,640
my you know position is on that Network

1523
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,260
fundamentals the most fundamentals

1524
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,940
really got to have a strong sense of

1525
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,559
architecture

1526
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:28,200
um and then the application Level stuff

1527
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,940
as well understanding how applications

1528
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,440
are vulnerable is is hugely beneficial

1529
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,599
yeah my pleasure thank you guys really

1530
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,220
appreciate the attendance
