1
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,700
the video

2
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:15,379
was awesome

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
um

4
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,820
you can go ahead sorry

5
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,239
okay we are yes sir we want to use the

6
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,260
microwave closer

7
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,480
with the largest museum

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,779
foreign

9
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:14,909
[Music]

10
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,920
zero and Trust the cloud uh when you

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,380
think about the Enterprise users uh

12
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,960
Fortune 500 or 40 percent of the Fortune

13
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,939
500 user they are trying to have to

14
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,479
z-scale Cloud every day 250 billion

15
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,700
transactions going through z-scan

16
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,979
account uh if you think about what what

17
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,840
does that mean right how many Google

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,759
searches a day

19
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,979
that's roughly eight eight point five

20
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,740
bit instruments um searches a day and a

21
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,780
Google search to us is one transaction

22
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,720
so if you think about the scale Google

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,020
has 8.5 searches a day and then we have

24
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,899
more than 250 billion transactions a day

25
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,119
so the level of the scale is probably

26
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,758
Way Beyond your imagination if you

27
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,700
didn't study the z-scale

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,720
so with that I wanted to

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,180
um talk a little bit about why we are

30
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,180
discussing this right so I actually have

31
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,160
been in the security industry on and off

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,280
for almost 25 years actually it was one

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,860
of the original president who wrote

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,459
ipsec code for FreeBSD 2.0 back uh more

35
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,819
than 25 years ago and I joined a company

36
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,800
called NFR I don't know how many of you

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,780
ever heard about nnpr but you know

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,340
that's the I couldn't even find a clear

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,340
image online this morning but that was

40
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,319
back in the days one of the pioneers of

41
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,360
intrusion detection uh in the 90s and uh

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,220
a few years ago I started a company

43
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,620
during AI machine learning uh it's

44
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,360
called a trust path it was acquired by

45
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,040
z-scale that's why I'm part of the

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,800
z-skeleton now now why AI machine

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,200
learning because there is something that

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,959
I learned many many years ago I felt

49
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,720
like wow that's a huge pain Point uh

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,120
jacking you know over there I listened

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,040
to your Zoom talk about for 10 minutes

52
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,800
my three takeaways from your talk the

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,540
word is we are screwed because the

54
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,180
hackers are winning second that we are

55
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,760
finally together and the third we need

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
more women so that's why we we I have a

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,379
co-speaker but I'm going to talk about

58
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,480
the first two things a little bit we are

59
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
screwed so back in 1998 I was reading

60
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,360
this paper uh

61
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,760
I don't know how many of you uh read it

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,040
in Social Invasion and the amount of

63
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,200
service including their work uh

64
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
intruding the connection there was this

65
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,299
was early in 1998 I read this paper I

66
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,220
truly truly believe we were screwed

67
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,080
because the way I read a paper I don't

68
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,120
know there's a solution for that we can

69
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,700
do intrusion Perfection all day long but

70
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,299
bad guys can just uh you know get ahead

71
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,640
of us whatever the security solution you

72
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,739
are going to be half a step if not 10

73
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,739
steps behind four practical purposes as

74
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,659
a computer science guy no matter how you

75
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,540
look at it it's just uh you cannot argue

76
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,480
against that people so that's why you

77
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,699
know part of the reason I actually sort

78
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,199
of left the security industry a little

79
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,600
bit I went on to do VMware I was I found

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,580
that a vmware's networking team and I

81
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,440
went on to do virtual networking laid

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,479
out but that was part of the reason I

83
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,919
was a little bit disappointed because

84
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:30,900
you know we really didn't have a way to

85
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,880
deal with security because you know no

86
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,680
matter what we do how fast we can come

87
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,960
up with signatures we are always always

88
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,020
have a step because the bad guys and the

89
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,240
problem is even worse in the last 20

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
years uh if you think about the solar

91
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,680
Wings right so when I thought about it

92
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,320
you know again using first principle how

93
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,540
to solve that problem well there are

94
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,280
billions of billing signals and then

95
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,199
data points we can potentially we could

96
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,780
have potentially gathered process it and

97
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,460
then make sense out of it and then got

98
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,400
ahead of that guys but you know it's

99
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,960
actually pretty difficult I think that

100
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,060
Jackie made a simple right you know

101
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,340
where's the data you know is the data

102
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,080
clean do you have the power to even

103
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,139
process the data it's just a lot of work

104
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,180
right when you think about it that is

105
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,100
the motivation for our top we actually

106
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,460
wanted to talk about how Zeta my team

107
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,160
right uh think about uh solving this

108
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,780
problem this is a part of the reason why

109
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,820
I founded a trust path a few years ago I

110
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,639
was thinking wow finally there's some

111
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,280
technology it's not a symbol for it but

112
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,780
it is a technology that has the

113
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,000
potential to deal with this you know

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,340
paper that was published back in 1998

115
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,560
and I I really argue the entire

116
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,600
networking industry secured industry

117
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,759
never had a solution for that paper

118
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,460
never ever and then but AI machine

119
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,639
learning if you uh give you a hope that

120
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,759
we can complement not a replace but

121
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,800
complement the existing conventional

122
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,380
technology to solve that problem so when

123
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,419
you look at it right you know we you

124
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:01,740
know security industry is a little bit

125
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,840
uh reactive we want it to be more

126
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,120
proactive you know we have very limited

127
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,400
Security operation guys we want 10x

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
ideally if you ask any sea Source they

129
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
want to appear Next Step 100x people to

130
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,240
deal with it right that's in practice

131
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,280
but we don't have that so that's why we

132
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,360
need AI machine learning now

133
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,220
we have been talking about using AI

134
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,080
machine learning for security for many

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,360
years almost 10 years I mean I'm talking

136
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,160
about even in the mainstream conference

137
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,139
like I say right I'm not even talking

138
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,660
about uh papers we've been talking about

139
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,639
malware detection URL categorization

140
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,100
this is an almost I want to say it's a

141
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,479
solving a problem but this is a well

142
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,539
understood uh we are as a company

143
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,280
z-scaler we have put that into

144
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,139
production for the last few years too

145
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,259
but it's a zero trust leader in the

146
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,539
industry we are kind of getting you know

147
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,419
solving uh newer categories of the

148
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,979
problem there are really two categories

149
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,139
that probably are solving one is you

150
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,180
know either with the threats every more

151
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,460
invasive threats right so that's just

152
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,039
you know wanted to uh easy to get ahead

153
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,080
of us right that's what the second thing

154
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,819
is really the policy that's actually

155
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,819
less understood and less the other ways

156
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,860
in the last 20 years if you think about

157
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,080
zero trust right it's about you know

158
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,639
which user can connect to which

159
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,800
applications it's not a problem until

160
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,660
you deal with ten thousand hundred

161
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,000
thousand users and 10 100 000

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,340
applications how can you do that in the

163
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,160
accurate way uh personal way the

164
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,400
contextual and the dynamic way uh how to

165
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,819
do that it's it's actually you need some

166
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,099
potential AI this is not a focus of this

167
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,599
topic I want to talk is more about

168
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,000
evasive threats uh dear friend is going

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,280
to talk more about it

170
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,319
um we actually you know got in once we

171
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,419
got into this scale of trespassing you

172
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,300
know here when is a our first hire into

173
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,880
the into the company she came from you

174
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,900
know the

175
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,780
um the Amazon kind of the Alexa kind of

176
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,880
background right you know knowing a lot

177
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,940
about the the data science and as a

178
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,500
company we know a lot of the security

179
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,539
the skin that you're right you know we

180
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:09,180
just celebrated 15 years of being

181
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,060
um the the anniversary and we have a lot

182
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,479
of data I showed you in the first slide

183
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,000
250 billion transactions that's like um

184
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,300
almost 30X of the Google searches a day

185
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,759
think about it right and how do we deal

186
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,800
with that but one thing I want to say is

187
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,900
in order to deal with that it's it's not

188
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,759
just the knowing AI machine with any

189
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,159
model they are actually when a very long

190
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,260
way in the last almost four years three

191
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,958
and a half years to actually came closer

192
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,140
to the security uh merging right you

193
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,779
know the the two disciplines Ai and the

194
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,120
Machine learning and the data science so

195
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,279
with that background I wanted her to

196
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,160
discuss more of the you know uh more

197
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,160
technology and also some useful some

198
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,880
case studies

199
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,459
so here as you see on this graph where D

200
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,380
scale AI machine learning is filled on

201
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,839
how about three pillars

202
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,200
model domain large and the data and here

203
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,700
I want to elaborate a little bit more

204
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,040
about the data part so these skills that

205
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,620
actually have 240 billion transactions

206
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,240
per day

207
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,279
um what does that mean Google search

208
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,040
transaction today anyone you know the

209
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,500
current number for the Google search

210
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,700
CPS for the

211
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,240
appreciation

212
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,779
um

213
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,860
um okay so with that

214
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,779
has enormous amount of data and most of

215
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,580
the traffic there are actually benign

216
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,899
only tiny bit is malicious and finding

217
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,480
those malicious one is like finding the

218
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,100
needle in his side

219
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,339
and what makes even worse is it basic

220
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,880
attacks um actor usually disguise their

221
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,580
traffic as normal as possible

222
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,880
so the key for find solving a solution

223
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,060
is how to find a way to separate the

224
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,160
signal from the noise

225
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,320
so now I'm going to introduce you our

226
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,420
special recipe to do so

227
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,000
so the most incredible ingredient for

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,540
this is a multi-dimensional data so the

229
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,580
First Dimension is about the Deep

230
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,680
hacking instruction

231
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,560
so that means we do the essence of

232
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,440
depression for HR transactions so that

233
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,660
we can get the information that the user

234
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,100
agent

235
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,080
and the second dimension is about

236
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,300
putting the transaction in the context

237
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,000
of time see what happens before and what

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,680
happened afterwards

239
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,019
so this allows you to really see what

240
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,279
was going on

241
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,620
imagine if each transaction is either

242
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,680
leave and this protein that put it in

243
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,440
the context allow you to see the tree

244
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,860
now the third dimension about the cloud

245
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,079
effect is really helping to see the

246
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,180
whole Forest

247
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,820
as Holly mentioned G together is a sales

248
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,720
vendor that means we have a data about

249
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,839
all the companies on the clouds

250
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,540
by the way the pi data has been removed

251
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,060
when it comes to the model for analysis

252
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,420
now think about the threat actor they

253
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,060
usually attack multiple companies

254
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,420
now with these scales called impact data

255
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,760
you are able to see the whole landscape

256
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,940
about how the threat actors evolve into

257
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,940
time and how we change from companies to

258
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,959
companies

259
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,420
it's interesting to see that a lot of

260
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,339
the the shares some common

261
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,380
characteristic but at the same time

262
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,740
there's some involvement going on there

263
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,680
so now we've got this precious

264
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,959
multi-dimensional data we still need a

265
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,779
powerful modeling techniques in order to

266
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,399
get the Insight out of this

267
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,220
multi-dimensional data

268
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,160
um so the our approach is innovation

269
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,480
over the existing unknown approach it's

270
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,320
a

271
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,839
typograph based machine learning

272
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,300
approach now I'm going to use a concrete

273
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,519
example to show you what this

274
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,500
multi-dimension data mean and what our

275
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,200
approach is such about

276
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,260
so this is a real Attack that delivers

277
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,040
ransomware at the end it does happen to

278
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,860
a half of the descaler customers but the

279
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,620
good thing is we were able to detach and

280
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,480
block it before dressing wear was

281
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,040
delivered

282
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,100
so there were three invasive tactics in

283
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,339
this attack first it was using the drive

284
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,740
by download to trick the user to

285
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,620
download a zip file which looks like a

286
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,079
normal Chrome update

287
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,440
and then we um if you click uh and then

288
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
that's if I actually can get a malware

289
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,420
which contains both blister loader and

290
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,519
the cobal stripe beakening when the

291
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,860
blister loader gets executed the code

292
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,480
was tried

293
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,920
the Mind Control started

294
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,060
um you might be thinking in this attack

295
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,180
even we're able to deter this blister

296
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,339
loader then we will stop the attack

297
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:12,839
halfway right

298
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,720
but unfortunately at least five the list

299
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,480
loader is very hard to detect

300
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,720
one is that the it was modified from a

301
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,720
legitimate dll and also using the

302
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,940
radical signing so that it can persist

303
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,800
in the system

304
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,620
it was able to bypass the idea of the

305
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,839
news actually so this is from the actual

306
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,579
block where for the customer being

307
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,760
impacted uh the ones highlight in red is

308
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,079
was this particular Network we arrived

309
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,260
in the endpoint and then you see in the

310
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,360
log there's actually some transition to

311
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,940
the India vendor so that shows that this

312
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,980
ER vendor was active when they see the

313
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,500
file but still it didn't manage to stop

314
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,120
the file

315
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,120
afterwards

316
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,420
and on guys total the detention was

317
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,880
um very low at the beginning and you see

318
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,180
a jump that was because uh when the

319
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,279
publisher block and that's why the other

320
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,440
vendor catch up

321
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,779
but in fact this guy was able to detect

322
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,940
one month earlier than the 81 hours

323
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,300
before

324
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,399
and he also want to highlight it even

325
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,860
though now on the BT but I sort of note

326
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,200
about this one I've been delicious but

327
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,120
still no one knows about where this far

328
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,639
downward from the the IP which where the

329
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,160
color file download from still is looks

330
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,360
back deny and there's no information

331
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,160
about how It's associated with this

332
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,720
attack

333
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,680
thank you

334
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,199
okay now this is the exciting part how

335
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,760
we detach it

336
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,899
um

337
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,839
the uh as I mentioned earlier we are

338
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,240
able to put a transaction in the context

339
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,060
so when you look these transaction along

340
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,399
with part at the most you see that user

341
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,399
agent is normal and there's a dno of r

342
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,560
but when you look what happened come to

343
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,380
us 10 minutes afterwards you see there's

344
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,860
a deepening to a particular domain

345
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,399
now the model has a hypothesis putting

346
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,560
connections between these two domains

347
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,420
you might notice we put a deadline

348
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,639
inside the solid line it's because it

349
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,500
could be still coincident at this point

350
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,199
just like I go to yahoo.com I go to

351
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,820
zero.com doesn't mean that they are

352
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,380
they've been correlated

353
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,120
although they might be a transformation

354
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,220
and that's where you might remember the

355
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,019
third dimension about the cloud effect

356
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:32,279
data

357
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,860
we'll see that this is happening across

358
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,199
two different companies from very two

359
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,180
different sectors

360
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,399
then the chance of being coincidence

361
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,260
lower and then it's more likely to be

362
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,880
correlation

363
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,100
so now the model have higher confidence

364
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,100
there's a correlation between these two

365
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,440
domains

366
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,720
and what we see was just one of the many

367
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,260
connections we are building by the model

368
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,160
and the

369
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,959
um and then you see in this graph some

370
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,779
of them was forming the Clusters there

371
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,480
and we zoom into one of the cluster is

372
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,480
one of which we're looking at earlier

373
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,000
um the this one was the one we're

374
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,639
looking but there's in fact more than

375
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,959
the um

376
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,420
what relations to this

377
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,940
and they are all shared by the same

378
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,880
users who've been attacked by the same

379
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,180
and if you look closer you see that the

380
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,980
um some other share the same ASM

381
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,420
information

382
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,120
so the graph here we see is that it's no

383
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,699
longer on the flat ground level you can

384
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,800
see the compile all the logic there in

385
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
terms of the correlation you can see the

386
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,279
whole quality from different dimensions

387
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,480
that's why it's a primograph

388
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,740
so this is a

389
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,740
depression we are able to detect use our

390
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,680
special recipe and this is a quick list

391
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,540
of iocs

392
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,579
this might look familiar to you this is

393
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:03,779
what you typically get from the

394
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,339
threatened Health it gives you a

395
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,599
blacklist

396
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,599
but earlier you see what we are able to

397
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,799
do uh by our approach not just give you

398
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,079
touch some more detection early

399
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,380
but also we help on the model

400
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,439
explanation how we digest what's this

401
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,359
right it could be about

402
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,179
as we see earlier it's not a planet we

403
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,040
give you a visualization you see how

404
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,919
they are connected

405
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,980
and also that we if you democrate on one

406
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,020
of these domains we give you a

407
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,419
explanation card for each individual

408
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:40,980
host

409
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,200
um so some of these Sometimes some send

410
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,419
our pictures and the feature value and

411
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:47,280
the future importance saying which one

412
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,280
is playing the largest role in detecting

413
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,559
the particular Force as liking

414
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,360
suspicious

415
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,140
we also have the data about the progress

416
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,660
so many of you been working on the soft

417
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,280
team you might remember look at the data

418
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,140
in your own environment right you see

419
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,840
where was this host was around

420
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,240
but now with these guys probably by data

421
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,179
you actually seen it across the multiple

422
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,820
companies see what earliest point he

423
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,120
actually arrived and then uh how it was

424
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,340
evolving so you get a better picture

425
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,419
about

426
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,760
um whether it's likely to be something

427
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,919
new or old not just from your own

428
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,059
environment but across different

429
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,539
environment

430
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,559
um

431
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,600
this my example of my thinking this

432
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,820
ground looks familiar rice photo does

433
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,559
give us some relational group right

434
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,520
should last word is very helpful in this

435
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,559
particular case this particular part was

436
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,960
totally for us is correlated to two

437
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,620
domains and one domain is this excess at

438
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,200
the same account I still looks like

439
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,260
benign the other one is icomize the

440
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,160
light again deny one so mean that at

441
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,179
this point

442
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,520
um again what I saw to know about this

443
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,960
part being malicious it doesn't know how

444
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,419
it's related to other C2 domains are way

445
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:09,419
downward from and what is total is very

446
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,120
useful but the uh as you can see in this

447
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,160
particular case it was not comprehensive

448
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,799
enough for some of the invasive type and

449
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,240
what we're doing here is able to

450
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,360
complement my story and give you more

451
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,240
early detection and more importantly the

452
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,299
insight into what's really happening

453
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,140
yeah

454
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,840
so we may have the reason we're able to

455
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840
do so is because we are able to put a

456
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,240
transaction in the context and also we

457
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,100
have the cloud effect

458
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,020
this is something we can do manually

459
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,580
right like how you said it's on model

460
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,900
scale

461
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,120
um I want to call you out in the case of

462
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,980
scale a lot of us might be thinking oh

463
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,260
it's just polarization right if I had

464
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,299
enough machine to paralyze it it might

465
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,340
solve the problem and when we call it

466
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,799
out of the challenge there is more than

467
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:59,100
that because think about this so each

468
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,280
transaction going through these together

469
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,179
across it right

470
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,620
um decide whether it's malicious or not

471
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,500
it is one translation is easy just like

472
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,080
people going to the airport scanning a

473
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,780
security scanning each forecasting by

474
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,299
check only this person that's easy

475
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,720
but if we ask about the contacts meaning

476
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,360
that each person needs to bring them a

477
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,860
Blog about what they did before

478
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,480
afterwards

479
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,000
as a as a

480
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,460
um as additional information was to

481
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,299
check

482
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,760
think about the memory required for that

483
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,799
it really only have one transaction but

484
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,500
if you ask this person to bring past one

485
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,660
week even one month later that's almost

486
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,960
right so how do we handle this memory

487
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,440
and then the um and be able to digest

488
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,760
those information even though they are

489
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,900
able to bring you and you're going to

490
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,660
see these 30 days fast enough so that's

491
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,760
where the challenge in terms of our

492
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,000
early approach give you the hypograph

493
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,679
that based on very efficient computation

494
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,900
not just on memory but also in

495
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,059
computational complexity and most

496
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,520
importantly give you the Insight that

497
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,260
you need

498
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,840
so this is not dimensional data is very

499
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,179
powerful I give you two examples but I

500
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,679
don't mean that that's the only the

501
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,620
signal there are no single killer

502
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,460
features it's all about the connection

503
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,799
among them so that's why we need AIML to

504
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,140
come in to learn how to combine these

505
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,500
different signals in case somebody

506
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,360
wondering what models we're using it's

507
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,640
not just one model they're actually more

508
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,559
than firing models even more models

509
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,380
under this so the um there are some of

510
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,000
them are deep learning model for example

511
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,640
to deter whether it's a DGA or not and

512
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,380
some of them are unsupervised learning

513
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,960
model to detect enormous and some of the

514
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,700
layers at the end was the supervised

515
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,020
learning model which should learn from

516
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,240
the path training data how to correlate

517
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,220
the data to get the signal together to

518
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,039
make the final verdict so it's really a

519
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,780
suite of the different models working

520
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,020
together to solve this problem

521
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,419
so finally on my session I wanted to

522
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,059
close with about the emphasize the

523
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,580
comprehensive

524
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,440
comprehensiveness of our model as we

525
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,679
mentioned inside that we generated from

526
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,419
our model is the most important one

527
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:18,360
right so we're not just happy with oh we

528
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,640
did have this early that's all we also

529
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,320
wanted to make it possible for you to

530
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,940
digest

531
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,760
um this is what is important

532
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,620
um I want to share with you this is an

533
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,840
article on nature published actually 16

534
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,280
years ago

535
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,980
salad is already called out daddy we

536
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,620
success of the Big Data it's actually

537
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,580
coming with the dangers of the trade-off

538
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,880
decrease in comprehensibility

539
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,240
with that the um

540
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,280
some of you working with AI machine

541
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,320
learning you might have this experience

542
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,559
about the black boss models from ml

543
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,799
where it gives you predictions about why

544
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,240
so that's definitely something we are

545
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,580
well aware in terms of one is probably

546
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,039
but also help the model to improve

547
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,140
further because if we don't know why

548
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,900
model made a mistake it would be again

549
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,600
you'll be almost gambling to try which

550
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,940
approach to to improve the model to the

551
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,460
next uh to take it to the next stage so

552
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,760
that's where the comprehensiveness is

553
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
critical for the customers who producing

554
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,080
these intelligence and also for

555
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,419
developers who build a model to really

556
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,340
understand why and then take it to the

557
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,860
next stage and this is actually article

558
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,320
return by my PhD advisor and this is

559
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,059
also research I have been doing for my

560
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,059
PhD making the model interpretable just

561
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,760
by how human beings would do and I'm

562
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,500
very happy to see that we are able to

563
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,900
make this really happening in the

564
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,299
industry not just a common and warning

565
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,280
that this could be a problem

566
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,970
thank you

567
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,900
[Music]

568
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,980
so

569
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,960
um at the beginning I mentioned that you

570
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,179
know the uh if you think about the

571
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,520
security problem a lot of that has to do

572
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,140
with you know leveraging the data

573
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,080
leverage that we are in and uh till when

574
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,840
I hopefully we give you a story that the

575
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,440
scale is what we wanted to overcome I

576
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,260
remember when you know I came to z-scale

577
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,559
I have to transact position our human

578
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,440
resource came to me and I said hey can

579
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,299
you actually explain to me why we need

580
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,640
Ai and machine learning because we have

581
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,740
been doing I'm sorry security for one

582
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,500
last 15 plus years and I it took me a

583
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,480
long time to even figure out how to

584
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,340
explain to someone who didn't know the

585
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,500
technology and I thought about it for

586
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,659
months and then later on I have had this

587
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,900
aha moment and I thought well there is

588
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,000
only one word I should have explained to

589
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,760
you which is the skill right the skill

590
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,460
of the data right the skill of the you

591
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,380
know all sorts of the behavior how do

592
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,360
you correlate them together the cloud

593
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,340
effects the scale is really the

594
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,679
challenge that's why we need to combine

595
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,000
the conventional technology and then the

596
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,039
rule-based or domain knowledge reverse

597
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,840
engineering together with the AI machine

598
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,659
learning data hopefully we will give you

599
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,720
that story give you a copy examples and

600
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,760
as I mentioned earlier like you know

601
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,860
Cloud native security is about invasive

602
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,360
threat detection it's also about

603
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,440
granular policy and in the future we see

604
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,179
that it's actually more than that

605
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,179
hopefully we will get to the world that

606
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,820
Ai and then data native security meaning

607
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,980
that you know the data is going to drive

608
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,860
the policy data is going to drive the uh

609
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,559
the the detection we are not there we

610
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,480
are we're still very far I mean today we

611
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,220
are still you know

612
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,080
um probably just like helping or

613
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,140
assisting uh the domain experts but we

614
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,700
hopefully make it a bigger and bigger

615
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,340
role and at some point right you know

616
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,779
the self-healing but that's going to be

617
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,640
the Nirvana I think the bad guys are

618
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,440
going to advance and then taking

619
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,820
advantage of the AI and a machine

620
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,940
learning as well so it's going to be

621
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,460
interesting battle but I do agree with

622
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,020
Jackie in the keynote opening

623
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,900
um speech in that the only way for us to

624
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,539
tackle was problems and combat the bad

625
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,720
guys is here together by here together

626
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,720
leveraging the data together by you know

627
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,460
hopefully we give you share the

628
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,620
intelligence and this is one of those

629
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,080
things that you know this is the end of

630
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,539
our presentation however if any of you

631
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,059
have any feedback we would have loved to

632
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,760
hear from you there's a survey form you

633
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,799
can just uh you know

634
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,860
put it out I'll make three questions and

635
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,720
uh the other thing is if you're like hey

636
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,520
this is kind of intelligence this is

637
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,039
kind of the uh approach that's a very

638
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,799
much interesting to you uh we would love

639
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,559
to follow up with you offline in terms

640
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,919
of the you know Advanced the technology

641
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,020
and or uh maybe sharing the data

642
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,120
figuring out some ways to sharing the

643
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,000
data with the community uh and then so

644
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,340
that a combat the bad guys together so

645
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,299
that's our talk

646
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,700
questions

647
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,739
[Music]

648
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,299
but we do have the QR code and we have

649
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,640
the semi phone and uh you know for you

650
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,260
to reach out to us you can take a

651
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,000
picture of our contact information too

652
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,659
thank you
