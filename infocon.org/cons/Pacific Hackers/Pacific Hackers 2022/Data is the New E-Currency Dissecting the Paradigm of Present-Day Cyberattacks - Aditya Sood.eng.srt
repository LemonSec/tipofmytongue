1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,820
important uh researcher and he's always

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,460
supported us so I thank you for doing

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,680
that every year and

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,440
um I'm absolutely positive that is it

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,180
gonna be an amazing talk so without

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,840
further ado

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,820
um

8
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,360
thank you

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,640
it's important

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640
um

11
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,179
thank you

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,780
okay

13
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,160
thank you

14
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,459
open it

15
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,120
okay I'm making it really easy

16
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,120
the only chain

17
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,019
s

18
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,019
things

19
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,980
yeah

20
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,979
[Music]

21
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,939
thanks John

22
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,459
so let's get it started if we are all

23
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,699
set and let's have a great run through

24
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,820
for 45 minutes and have a deep

25
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,740
understanding of what we are going to

26
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,160
talk about today so today the purpose of

27
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
this talk is to focus on the data that

28
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,660
is not about like you know seeing the

29
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,060
state of data or distributed way the way

30
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,400
data is transacting not talk about like

31
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,680
technology but we are going to focus

32
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,720
mostly on what is the importance of data

33
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,060
in the cyber security phase primarily

34
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,400
the attacks that are happening

35
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,060
foreign

36
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,380
little disclaimer the idea behind this

37
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,240
research is to highlight what exactly

38
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,759
going in the underground cyber world and

39
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,680
how exactly the cyber attacks are

40
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,180
happening in real time

41
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,120
so the purpose is to understand some of

42
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,919
the things we might not have seen in the

43
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,139
wild but we have you know talked too

44
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,240
much about it this malware that malware

45
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,220
but what exactly is happening behind the

46
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,680
bars so all the research that we are

47
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,900
going to focus today is primarily for

48
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,580
education purposes

49
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,500
there is no relevance turning to like

50
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,139
the company or any organization or any

51
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,940
kind of those sort of things the purpose

52
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,580
here is only educating ourselves to

53
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,400
understand what it is all about

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,280
a brief background of mine so the idea

55
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,539
to highlight what we are going to

56
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,340
present today we know what we are

57
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,020
talking and why we are sharing this

58
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,240
information being in this field for last

59
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,139
15 16 years drafted two books so you can

60
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,660
check uh the background and get a feel

61
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,880
about it

62
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,039
but what is the agenda today so today

63
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,360
we're gonna look into the data

64
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,100
perspective we're going to look into the

65
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,620
exponential Horizon security breaches

66
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,419
but then we're going to talk about the

67
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,820
underground cyberspace Paradigm we want

68
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,680
to see how attackers are utilizing

69
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,699
underground cyber space for selling data

70
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,820
that they have stolen or accident rated

71
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,620
we will look into dissecting the

72
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,720
advanced tracks we'll take in the real

73
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,520
world use case studies often first

74
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,300
dealer blocky botnet lucky rat

75
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,680
clarifying infactions and all those sort

76
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,020
of things but the main purpose behind

77
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,199
this is to highlight how different and

78
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,120
variations of these kind of cyber

79
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,039
attacks are happening in the wild and

80
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,139
how they are accelerating data so you

81
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,419
will see that from standard systems to

82
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,819
the cloud to the other set all this

83
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,539
thing is happening

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,740
so let's take a look into the data

85
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,300
perspective why we are talking about

86
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,639
data today right so if you look at the

87
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,740
way Technologies are advancing day by

88
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,840
day the way devices are interconnected

89
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,880
and the way transactions are happening

90
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,639
which means that you know earlier you

91
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,860
know Technologies were there but not

92
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,660
that advanced because you know there are

93
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,940
standard way of infrastructure or design

94
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,919
but right now things are different

95
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:07,560
Mobility is the key devices everything

96
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,199
has to stay connected the world of

97
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,139
applications that's a big problem also

98
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,360
of course it has revolutionized our life

99
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,580
but at the same time it has given rise

100
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,979
to different attack surfaces as well

101
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,840
which will go through during the course

102
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,960
of this talk but this is the problem and

103
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,840
the idea behind it is who controls the

104
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,360
data who owns the data is going to hold

105
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,900
the keys to retainer

106
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,819
only brings layout of how the biggest

107
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,380
data bridges are happening in last

108
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,840
couple of years so you can talk about we

109
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,180
started from thousands of dollars of uh

110
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,220
you know cost we had transformed into

111
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,840
millions and now we're talking about

112
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,120
billions and down the lanes is going to

113
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,699
be much more to that which entails to

114
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,160
the problem that it is the big issue and

115
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,099
we need to handle it efficiently that's

116
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,500
tax I like it here is actually the

117
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,419
reflection of the real world scenario

118
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,639
how exactly these things are happening

119
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,500
and why it is important to look into it

120
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,240
before starting further I'll actually

121
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,340
want to highlight understanding about

122
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,740
the cyberspace Paradigm you know how

123
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,380
undergone cyber security has been going

124
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,440
on and basically how attackers are uh

125
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,720
transforming the internet into the

126
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,160
underground cyber space

127
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,060
the very first screenshot you highlight

128
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,460
here is that the

129
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,560
advertisement in the underground cyber

130
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,779
space talking about one of the biggest

131
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,779
organization that was the Compromise so

132
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,099
let's say I don't want to hold it what

133
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,799
it was basically the ba systems so you

134
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,020
can clearly see that the stolen data is

135
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,339
being sold in the underground Community

136
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,220
if we go back to the purpose we really

137
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,140
need to look into it's still the data

138
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,300
right why they are selling data they

139
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,160
should have like compromised the systems

140
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,140
you do it for fun but then the question

141
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,080
is about today most of cyber attacks

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,700
after going after

143
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,120
basically monetary benefits and that is

144
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,459
the most important part

145
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,560
another one that you look into is

146
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,480
recently happening that is in the

147
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,300
November uh is about another biggest

148
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,120
cooperation in the south Asia and

149
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,360
talking about uh the Chata power their

150
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,880
systems got compromise and the way data

151
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,820
is being handled and you know stored in

152
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,100
the underground cyber community is just

153
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,160
one to watch to look into but these all

154
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,779
things are happening in the real world

155
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,000
you and me might not be able to see it

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,279
in the wild but this is all happening so

157
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,080
you can see how much impact this is

158
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,019
gonna cause three organizations

159
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,540
similarly if you look into this one uh

160
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,240
the prime beer products we did in 2012

161
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,980
we wrote a very detailed paper on

162
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,839
crimeware as a service where we talk

163
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,240
about variety of services that detectors

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,399
are selling and these have gone Advanced

165
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,140
with the passage of time you know it's

166
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,880
the Advent of cloud infrastructure

167
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,220
Technologies things have changed a lot

168
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,860
but if you look at into it like apart

169
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,899
from trading cards stolen data and all

170
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,459
those things are also giving you a

171
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,459
service of compromise CNC panels which

172
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,620
is basically relying on you know malware

173
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,680
posted on the command control on a

174
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,019
compromised infrastructure so you can

175
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,300
just go ahead and one can buy that so

176
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,100
look at the way this thing has been

177
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,320
productized right and this is all

178
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,540
happening in front of our eyes but just

179
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,100
we can't see it

180
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,260
if you look into this specific one it's

181
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,360
all about selling exfiltrated data look

182
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
at the way these people are selling the

183
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,800
data the my posture again in this case

184
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,540
is that if you look at the context of

185
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,580
This research the focus is on you know

186
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,180
why data right as I mentioned earlier I

187
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,860
will reiterate it again during the

188
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,600
course of this talk who owns the data

189
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,300
going to own everything on the internet

190
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,279
and this is just only a one part of it

191
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,920
just a few samples uh we are sharing

192
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,899
here but this is the tip of the iceberg

193
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,660
there's a much much more to value

194
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,700
so let's take a look into the advanced

195
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,920
threads so right now what we have gone

196
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,300
through is looking into how the

197
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,760
underground cyberspace look like what's

198
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,860
being sold there how big organizations

199
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,760
that are being sold here as well

200
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,279
so look into the advanced malicious code

201
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,380
we can also call them as a digital

202
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,420
weapons these days as well we talk about

203
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,459
ransomware we talk about information

204
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,579
Stealers remote Administration toolkits

205
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,860
payload downloaders crypto miners

206
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,680
service booters scanners and exploit

207
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,779
Frameworks and communication hijackers

208
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,060
so every single

209
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,640
you know variation of this malicious

210
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,519
score is deadly in its own context the

211
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,860
way it is being used we call as a

212
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,240
digital weapons these days because

213
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,519
that's why the attackers are going after

214
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,980
utilizing these malware or malicious

215
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,500
proteins entirely of the fly and that is

216
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,420
the problem and what we really need to

217
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,000
do will look deep down into the course

218
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,860
of This research

219
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,860
so just for a basic overview when we

220
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,600
talk about Advanced threats right we

221
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,220
talk about malicious course you know

222
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,779
what kind of characteristics these are

223
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,180
so if I gave it a very simple one the

224
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,920
malicious code that has the capability

225
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,079
to subvert the Integrity of the system

226
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,360
where it is run whether it's your

227
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,579
operating system whether it's a no node

228
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,380
or whether it's a real rare containers

229
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,839
they have the capability to abuse the

230
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,000
inherent infrastructure and of course

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,700
the systems as well so for that any

232
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,440
characteristics that will they do for

233
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
masquerading tampering hijacking

234
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,120
supporting and many more the idea here

235
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,579
is to that to transform the system into

236
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,980
such a state that it can be abused for

237
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,600
nefarious purposes

238
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,519
and threat actors we can talk about

239
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,560
attackers you know you know employees

240
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,480
that I know sometimes they make mistakes

241
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,279
arrangious employees who say

242
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,800
nation-state actors and cyber criminals

243
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,019
so at this point of time what we have

244
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,240
gone through is looking into the little

245
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,220
bit idea about underground cyber space

246
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,100
Paradigm what Advanced threats are and

247
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,839
why we are transforming them into a

248
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,480
digital weapons uh what attackers are

249
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,980
actually going after them

250
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,139
so just to look into the simple life

251
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,120
cycle so we get a feel of it you know

252
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,399
how infections are spread before we go a

253
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,139
deep dive into the real world case

254
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,240
studies of course you know you visit

255
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,240
some website or while fishing so whether

256
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,980
you can call us a fishing so there is a

257
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,200
variety of different uh you know attacks

258
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,300
employees so there can be a tier one you

259
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,040
know a freshly which simply redirects

260
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,260
you to go to a some web page which has

261
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,540
you know conducts on social engineering

262
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,639
directory and then asks you to give the

263
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,040
credentials right tier two is basically

264
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,260
that phishing attacks are happening you

265
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,880
can just drive my download attacks right

266
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,920
you click the link go to some web page

267
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,620
your system get exploited by browser and

268
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,779
then you got impacted tier three

269
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,940
basically falls into the category of you

270
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,680
know pressuring attacks that are

271
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,600
happening having attachment and emails

272
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,820
so you open the email you get an

273
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,040
attachment you open it and you just got

274
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,440
infected the whole purpose is that you

275
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,480
have to actually control the system is

276
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,120
maybe it could be a part of controlling

277
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,339
or compromising one system or making a

278
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,220
part of a botnet but that's where these

279
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,019
things are happening and the digital

280
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,880
weapons the malicious store that you

281
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,579
used to do that is the key here and once

282
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,560
your system is impacted and compromised

283
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,700
you know different things can be done

284
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,740
so let's talk about info sealer in

285
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,540
action so this is one of the recent one

286
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,399
that came across we did really good

287
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,200
study on that it is called as a black

288
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,839
garden posterior it's of Russian origin

289
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,839
it connected distributed attack and the

290
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,519
way it is spread all across on the

291
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,920
internal various countries and all that

292
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,079
which we'll take a look into and then

293
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,360
we'll get a feel about it if you look

294
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,000
into this one uh so if you look at the

295
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,260
blue picture here this actually

296
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,019
highlights the uh this command and

297
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,600
control panel how it looks like so if

298
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,459
you get into the infrastructure and you

299
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,440
open it in a browser if you're lucky to

300
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,420
get the IP address or a domain where

301
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,279
it's being posted so you'll see

302
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,779
something like that

303
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,699
so what we did in part of this research

304
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,380
we were able to find some vulnerability

305
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,720
into it and then we actually exploited

306
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,579
that one or the other way it maybe could

307
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,860
be a part of configuration issue or

308
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,720
maybe some sort of a problem in the web

309
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,720
framework so when we did that so if you

310
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,000
look at this particular picture in this

311
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,160
case you can see the type of data being

312
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,959
downloaded so you can look at him the

313
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,000
idea it was from Sweden Switzerland

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,519
United Kingdom States and many more

315
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,339
countries and it was all posted on a one

316
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,440
specific command and control so you

317
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,240
could have imagined how many command and

318
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,800
control panels are being running in the

319
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,660
wild right

320
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,760
so if you look into the other part we

321
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,800
are just analyzing the state of stolen

322
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,560
data in this case if you look at it in

323
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,600
this one it's highlighting the passwords

324
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,000
that are being stolen from the end users

325
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,160
the point is not about the passwords

326
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,500
here is the point is about like the

327
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,540
different applications that users are

328
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,339
using and they are able to actually

329
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,440
extract the credentials for those apps

330
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,380
for example it involves Uber it involves

331
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,120
Delta it involves Amazon

332
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:06,000
right so what single user or multiple

333
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,040
user utilizing these applications their

334
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,440
accounts are compromised so as a part of

335
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,000
the testing when you try the control

336
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,160
Manner and for threat intelligence it

337
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,380
all works and it doesn't include all the

338
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,060
application it also includes their

339
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,000
routers as well and if you look at the

340
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,740
other one here it actually talks about

341
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,199
the data structure and the layout which

342
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,300
actually highlights how efficiently they

343
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,579
are storing data so adapters are just

344
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,320
not simply going after okay I'm going to

345
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,360
extract that data I'm gonna dump it they

346
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,220
are dumping it in a very specific way

347
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,860
because if you remember in an earlier

348
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,540
slides we talked about they need to sell

349
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,660
that they cannot sell the data that is

350
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,279
crappy in nature they really need to

351
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,019
clean the data they really need to sell

352
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:48,899
it in a way that can be consumed by the

353
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,000
other adversaries and that's what is

354
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,839
happening right now

355
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,620
another example is that it's not about

356
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,240
the credentials only it's about your

357
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,220
crypto Wallet information it's also

358
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,799
about your session information and To

359
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,679
None class it's also about your uh

360
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,419
Messengers like whether using Discord

361
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,640
you're using Telegram and all that they

362
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,819
see it all and you can just imagine it's

363
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,679
not about as I said credentials which

364
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,540
has already gone out of the way but it's

365
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,400
all about the other ways

366
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,220
so the attack surface could not be only

367
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,720
the credentials because we're going to

368
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,699
use them but also your session identity

369
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,220
Parts also the telegram records and also

370
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,540
for like the score

371
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,120
data and all that but it's all happening

372
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,100
in front of us and we analyze this data

373
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,500
in and out

374
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,960
so if you look at this screenshot this

375
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,640
is taken from one of the compromises

376
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,620
term in the United Kingdom so these guys

377
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,720
are not only holding to the data sets

378
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,580
which we have described but they are

379
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,559
also kind of going after We're not gonna

380
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,140
leave any single thing in the compromise

381
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,960
system anytime user is maneuvering in

382
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,299
the system making some calls or doing

383
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,059
some you know activity they capture the

384
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,760
screenshots as well so in this case they

385
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,260
are not only able to get all the other

386
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,600
information but also other system level

387
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,360
information or you know kind of software

388
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,160
that are being installed are basically

389
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,080
also analyzing the behavior of the end

390
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,299
user

391
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,760
so that exactly highlights you know when

392
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,559
these kind of distributed attacks happen

393
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,480
as a part of encos dealer

394
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,580
the kind of data that is extracting out

395
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,679
so the importance of data goes really

396
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,860
really high in this case as well

397
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,500
so now we looked into the infos dealer

398
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,419
let's take a little bit uh look into the

399
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,820
lofty botnet right so this partnet is

400
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,880
being you know deployed a lot these days

401
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,559
highly efficient and doing some sort of

402
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,480
napelius activities on the internet as

403
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,880
well so when I say A botnet you know

404
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,440
thousands of machines are compromised

405
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,360
running lock keyboard all connected back

406
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,760
to command and control panel they have

407
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,340
like HPD based command control panel so

408
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,380
you can you know if you get the identity

409
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,260
you get the domain name IP address you

410
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,660
can you know get to it

411
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,419
but important part in this case is that

412
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,520
it's going on for a couple of years but

413
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,740
it's still residing in the context of

414
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,360
security and track intelligence the

415
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,700
ReUse of the botnet port right right so

416
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,160
somebody built a Harris bot which was

417
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,140
like heavily used earlier as well and

418
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,640
then they transformed them some

419
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,880
components up into a very efficient one

420
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,380
transforming it where the earlier board

421
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,299
was detected but they don't want to get

422
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,220
detected this time so they create a

423
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,100
response and that's how you Advanced

424
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,299
right that's all these attackers

425
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,000
advanced in the building I would say

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,200
just the weapons

427
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,480
so if you look at this screenshot it

428
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,100
also gives you the login panel for the

429
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,020
Lockheed botnet command and control

430
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,539
panel but you look at the other kind of

431
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,940
you know modules that it's for from

432
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,400
reconnect disconnect screenshot you know

433
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,039
start the logger disable stop and all

434
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,600
those kind of things so it actually

435
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,580
highlights the kind of operation that

436
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,559
detector can perform Right Way in the

437
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,380
compromise system

438
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,000
similarly if you look into the this uh

439
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,100
screenshot here it actually talks about

440
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,799
the operation basically the commands

441
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,240
that is for like we can shut down the

442
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,919
system they can you know fetch more

443
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,679
boundaries uh from the internet and you

444
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,600
know install multiple malware onto the

445
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,059
system as well so that is most important

446
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,919
part of it because then they can use

447
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,980
your system which is compromised to uh

448
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,100
launch to make it a launch pad that you

449
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,660
can trigger more attacks on the top of

450
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,820
it so it doesn't mean that if the system

451
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,160
is compromised it's a part of the botnet

452
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,740
it just only holds some specific type of

453
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,799
purpose no the all the Bots can be used

454
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,799
to launch pad act as a Launchpad sorry

455
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,460
in that case to trigger more infections

456
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,580
so we look into that botnet play how it

457
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,559
looks like and all that right now we are

458
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,400
kind of looking into the remote

459
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,140
administration too

460
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,179
this is a Lockheed rack this is not a

461
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,520
lucky part so why I want to talk about

462
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,440
this that because this rat is being

463
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,820
heavily used to impact government

464
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,600
systems all across the globe right so we

465
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,520
have transcript of information but I

466
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,260
will probably show you a couple of uh

467
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,179
you know snapshots of that so you can

468
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,539
get an idea where these actually wraps

469
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:12,480
penetrate and what kind of systems they

470
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,059
kind of compromise in this case

471
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,160
so let's take a look at it how it looks

472
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,720
like so again a command and control

473
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,640
panel for the lock event you can clearly

474
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,400
see how it looks like so they they can

475
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,200
also change the protocols sometimes they

476
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,179
could have HTTP based command control

477
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,980
panel or they can use custom protocol

478
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,559
like they enhance the talent protocol to

479
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,419
actually use it for command and control

480
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:36,299
communication but here is a another

481
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,340
screenshot that I highlight how this

482
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,260
lucky rad is constructed so it's a part

483
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,940
of the source code so you can see client

484
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,580
on the server so rats also being

485
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,340
designed in such a way that you can use

486
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,400
it as a part of a soft proxy or you can

487
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,500
also be a reverse proxy it all depends

488
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,720
how your network controls are bigger in

489
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,520
an organization and how they need to

490
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,280
bypass it so as I mentioned earlier that

491
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,440
when they compromise the system and what

492
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,320
is running which has the capability to

493
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,360
download more malware into the systems

494
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,580
so attackers use that capability to

495
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,500
download remote Administration toolkits

496
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,780
once they decide this income is critical

497
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,419
and then they completely own it as do

498
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,400
things like that and I'll show you the

499
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,080
kind of data these guys are picking out

500
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,179
of the government systems that are

501
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,419
compromising yeah so again after like a

502
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,159
confidential chat but it doesn't matter

503
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,200
at the end of the day this is all in all

504
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,020
so this actually a screenshot highlights

505
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,760
the communication that our government

506
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,140
offer one specific country is doing with

507
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,200
other countries but you can imagine the

508
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,320
kind of uh you know the decision making

509
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,640
process that particular governments are

510
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,320
doing and that is all revealed on the

511
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,179
internet that is all some attackers are

512
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,280
using that so before they do anything

513
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,500
these guys have the information that

514
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,539
what exactly we need to do and they

515
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,520
actually go really ballistic and then

516
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,440
actually go after launching other set of

517
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,480
attacks or maybe if information is

518
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,580
stolen then they have all the capability

519
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,100
to make smarter decisions so they it

520
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,620
could impact greatly to the businesses

521
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,900
of the organization not only government

522
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,659
ones but also the you know the specific

523
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,080
critical infrastructure once as well so

524
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,299
here I'm actually highlighting uh the

525
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,419
live recording of uh WebEx which is

526
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:23,460
again from a compromise system that's

527
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,659
specific to a one government

528
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,340
organization

529
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,500
so I actually removed that all that data

530
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,480
highlighting the pictures were a part on

531
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,860
that but you can clearly see the

532
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,080
countries that are involved and it's all

533
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,600
kind of information and I would say data

534
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,980
that is extracted out of those

535
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,500
compromise systems so my question in

536
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,900
this case which I always ask myself and

537
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,760
you know want to ask the community as

538
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,799
well we believe that we have enough

539
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,500
defenses in place but if that's the case

540
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,960
why all these things are happening right

541
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,880
I mean we have so many Fantastic salary

542
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,159
Solutions in place that they are already

543
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,559
helping no doubt on that but still

544
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,780
attackers find a way to actually

545
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,419
some other loopholes to go ahead and get

546
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,120
this kind of data you can imagine if

547
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,039
your decision making process is being

548
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,080
leaked before exactly the season being

549
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,200
available so how impactful it can be for

550
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
the organization and the governments

551
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,799
right but it is all happening and it's

552
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,600
one of the biggest problem that the

553
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,820
world is facing

554
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,860
so right now if I just little bit

555
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,440
re-itrate we talk about you know why

556
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,539
that is important the perspective in

557
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,460
this present World we've gone through

558
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,620
the you know Advanced tracks why we need

559
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,419
to call them you know digital weapons

560
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,640
we're going through the layout of you

561
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,620
know targeted cyber attacks the contacts

562
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,140
for fishing talking about tier one tier

563
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,780
two and tier three attacks we then talk

564
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,780
about you know lucky bought botnet is

565
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,559
also info sealer right now we also need

566
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,600
to look into the cloud infrastructure

567
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,360
right I mean it cannot be you know

568
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,620
remaining

569
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,659
unimpacted in the sense right you know

570
00:24:57,659 --> 00:24:59,159
like attackers are not targeting This

571
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,260
Cloud infrastructure that is not the

572
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,559
case cloud is being abused left right or

573
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,240
I would say north south east and west

574
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,659
it's all across so let's take a few uh

575
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,640
examples and a real world case studies

576
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,120
to look into how critical this state is

577
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,159
so here I'm actually presenting the team

578
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,000
TNT kubernetes uh you know exploit and

579
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,460
uh attack model where we really need to

580
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,159
understand here is that how exactly the

581
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,980
attackers went after exploiting the

582
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,620
Cube's real command and then exactly

583
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,720
going from there into different nodes

584
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,179
which contains different parts right so

585
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:38,279
they went through that utility because

586
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,200
it has like exposed service and they

587
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,640
just completely went into the cloud

588
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,980
infrastructure you know manipulating the

589
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,659
orchestration framework in this case is

590
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,880
kubernetes so once you actually get a

591
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,039
control of the pod which is like running

592
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,500
multiple nodes in a cluster and then you

593
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,179
can actually utilize it for nefarious

594
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,760
purposes so what we saw in this case is

595
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,559
that you know vulnerabilities employed

596
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,240
or maybe a configuration bug was

597
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,279
exploited they went in they figured it

598
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,559
out running clusters in kubernetes and

599
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,480
of course nodes were there but then they

600
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,820
able to compromise couple of ports in it

601
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,820
once that is done you know they abuse it

602
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,159
for crypto mining operations

603
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,260
so it's a part of our research we were

604
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,700
analyzing this attack many other

605
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,620
security researchers looked into it as

606
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,520
well

607
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,700
what came to our surprise is that how

608
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,799
these attackers actually utilized NVIDIA

609
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,380
drivers to do that so they had these

610
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,539
kubernetes you know root payload scripts

611
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:31,740
that are fetched from the remote

612
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,720
location so if you look at this

613
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,880
particular screenshot it's like fetching

614
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,799
the shell files because of course the

615
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,620
Pod is compromised usually the outbound

616
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,600
communication which call as an egress

617
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,520
communication a pretty open right so

618
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,440
because you need to use it for updates

619
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,600
patching packages and sort of other

620
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,779
things but if one attacker is able to

621
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,340
find it out and you know compromise the

622
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,080
part it is also possible they are

623
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,659
utilize that kind of configuration to

624
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,360
abuse it and that's how it happens so

625
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,039
once the Pod is compromised you can

626
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,500
catch these kind of your kubernetes root

627
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,200
payload the AdWords attacker did and if

628
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,299
you look at the Shelf script it has like

629
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,640
everything that is needed to actually

630
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,460
fetch more NVIDIA drivers and then do it

631
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,140
all and why that is the case because if

632
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,539
you look into the crowd infrastructure

633
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,880
anything that gets compromised let's say

634
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,620
in this case is a bond they are able to

635
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,480
abstract the underlying system

636
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
information like rather this particular

637
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,980
cloud infrast structure is sporting any

638
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,659
kind of specific configuration which

639
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,360
allows them to run heavy and robust and

640
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,340
with your drivers and when they figure

641
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,080
it out they thought like okay that's the

642
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,760
case now let's dispatch and with your

643
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,740
drivers and then transform into a crypto

644
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,720
mining operation because then you can

645
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,520
harness the power of uh you know

646
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,380
underlying infrastructure but you can

647
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,120
see that apart from that they're going

648
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,100
to exploit it of course they're going to

649
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,260
extract a lot of data out of it but the

650
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,120
amount of cost that is going to incur to

651
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,679
the organization in this case right

652
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,179
because their systems are running day

653
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,159
and night maybe they can use you know

654
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,840
sleep mode where they can actually do it

655
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,240
little bit you know step by step but

656
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,120
that depends on the artifacts we

657
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,919
analyzed that and we were able to figure

658
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,299
it out like how they're actually

659
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,520
utilizing the Google Cloud for this kind

660
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,159
of operations as well and all what we

661
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,380
are highlighting here is actually how

662
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,299
they actually did the whole purpose of

663
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,580
fetching Nvidia driver installing them

664
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,159
running on the compromise watch and then

665
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,020
let the crypto mining operations keep on

666
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,419
going on and it's just not only the

667
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,279
crypto mining operations but this is

668
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,980
also more related to other interactions

669
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,559
like using Cloud infrastructure again

670
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,779
for launching new setup for that but

671
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,179
this is all happening in the real world

672
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,400
and what we are highlighting is not

673
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,980
apart from the one set of malware but it

674
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,020
is like different set of malicious code

675
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,240
that is being utilized depending on the

676
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,640
infrastructure

677
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,279
so now this is the another most

678
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,500
important research that we are doing in

679
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,360
recent times like I don't know you know

680
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
when you have open up you know browsers

681
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,720
media Outlets we are seeing that

682
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,980
thousands and thousands of cloud

683
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,779
database businesses are compromised

684
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:04,500
right

685
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,659
and that is another biggest uh you know

686
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,299
threat to actor these days and I want to

687
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:10,620
highlight a little bit more in this

688
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,659
space like a couple of years back when

689
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,700
we build applications we talk about tier

690
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,020
one three or two and tier three

691
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,720
applications right and in that case like

692
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,279
specifically the application

693
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,260
architecture tier three we talk about

694
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,120
how the databases are being displayed

695
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,460
right now in this present world we talk

696
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,620
about microservices based architecture

697
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,179
you know where applications are much

698
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,760
more on demand but the more important

699
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,860
aspect that we really need to look into

700
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,260
is again the databases because that's

701
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,240
where data is stored very simple thing

702
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,460
right so why not the attackers gonna go

703
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,380
after these databases whether they are

704
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,360
Standalone systems are that they are

705
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,179
deployed as a service right dbased so in

706
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,860
this case what we have seen that of

707
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,779
course this problem popping up and you

708
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,399
know as a researcher what we really need

709
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,799
to do in this context so what we did we

710
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,840
definitely and I analyze the real world

711
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,179
systems in this case we started with the

712
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:01,980
elasticsearch instances

713
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,220
and you may expose one so it will look

714
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,720
extensive amount of uh you know child

715
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,360
being spent in this case but we figured

716
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,520
it out like the patterns the you know

717
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,440
how these you know systems are like

718
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,000
elasticsearch databases are being

719
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,100
impacted with ransomware right so you

720
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,679
have like you know proper API interface

721
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,140
HTTP one elasticsearch you go through

722
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,120
and you can search through indexes and

723
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,658
all that right

724
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,820
okay so mongodb uh as you know in

725
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,740
mongodb we have collections collections

726
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,240
are alternative in nature and then

727
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,940
databases a structure you have

728
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,620
collections in there and you throw data

729
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,460
accordingly so we'll focus both most

730
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,559
most of these uh scenarios where like

731
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,480
the included elastic circumstances and

732
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,120
longer eb1 and this example actually

733
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,240
highlight how when the it is impacted

734
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,580
with run somewhere I don't matter when

735
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,159
some messages are being displayed uh if

736
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,140
you scan through the whole indices and

737
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,520
you scan through the collections in

738
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,700
mongodb and that's how it looks like but

739
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,679
as a researcher we don't want to stop

740
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,419
here like the question that we ask

741
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:08,580
ourselves is what exactly we really need

742
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,320
to do like these interactions are

743
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,480
happening we did a detailed study you

744
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,860
know we build the threat intelligence

745
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,919
modules on that so the question that we

746
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,419
need to solve here is that can we build

747
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,399
a certain set of tools in this case

748
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,740
where we can actually highlight that you

749
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,059
know these this kind of tools have

750
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,460
capability to kind of detect infections

751
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,640
and elastic search and mongodb and we

752
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,140
did the same

753
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,080
so the very first tool we just designed

754
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,179
in this case was Stratford it was a

755
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,059
total written in Python it basically

756
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:41,340
automates the whole intelligence that we

757
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,899
gather during the research detecting

758
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,760
elastic circumstances in fact it's

759
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,100
ransomware it's all available on the

760
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,200
internet GitHub you can patch it so the

761
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,360
tool actually highlights against a real

762
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,460
world IP it's not active anymore right

763
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,320
now but you can see that how it actually

764
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,840
goes through every single in this

765
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,000
indices and that and then actually able

766
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,100
to detect it where the ransom

767
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,380
Massachusetts and what it's all about so

768
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,940
the tools have different modules you can

769
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,520
do a basic scan and then you can also do

770
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,679
an intrusive scan but it's all automated

771
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,679
for the audience to do more research

772
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,960
similarly we build another two callers

773
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,940
landslaught this is a capability to

774
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,559
detect run somewhere in factions and

775
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:22,200
longer Dev instances again it's in a

776
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,200
live uh you know run against light

777
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,600
Target you can see how exactly detected

778
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,059
or different kind of modules

779
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,399
so the part of doing all this research

780
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,899
and you share it with the community is

781
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,940
that they can utilize This research and

782
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,679
then when they are building components

783
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,720
in the cloud infrastructure they can

784
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,520
actually utilize these tools as a part

785
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,799
of their agile testing or other testing

786
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,899
procedure at least they can use that you

787
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,419
know a kind of uh intelligence that has

788
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,820
been shared or why these tools to go

789
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,700
ahead and make sure the databases that

790
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,799
you deploy in your Cloud infrastructure

791
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,320
remains secure rather than doing it

792
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,760
later on it could be a part of

793
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,620
penetration testing or you know

794
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,360
vulnerability assessment scenarios as

795
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,820
well but rather than you know it could

796
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,980
be done right away during the deployment

797
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,140
whether you follow shift right or shift

798
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,320
labroaches it all depends but you can do

799
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,360
that and utilize other security

800
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,159
researchers work to make sure they're

801
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,279
doing again the question is why it is as

802
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,559
I mentioned data resides in databases so

803
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,200
we want to make sure any component where

804
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,899
data is being stored we need to ensure

805
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:30,659
that those are secure but these tools

806
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,120
are available you can check online you'd

807
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,100
like the program then do it

808
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,559
really good with it

809
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,419
so right now we cover different

810
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,340
variations the way cyber attacks are

811
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,960
happening whether it's Cloud whether

812
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,460
they design botnets remote

813
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,500
Administration toolkits and the kind of

814
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,880
data they stored

815
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,860
so we recently did another interesting

816
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,559
research when the recent nation state

817
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,080
conflict that was happening I don't want

818
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,480
to go which entities are involved we all

819
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,820
know but we'll generalize the aspect of

820
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,039
it out

821
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,419
dangerous it could be into the Internet

822
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:06,659
space when it occurs when K wire varies

823
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:08,040
from a one nation state or the other

824
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,899
nation state or from the global Mission

825
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,599
States but here's the thing we really

826
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,099
need to understand in the context of

827
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,560
data what exactly was that so when we're

828
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,418
analyzing all those things you know

829
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:20,699
different kind of things that got leaked

830
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,139
on the internet whether it's the grass

831
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,119
from documents which I'll show you a

832
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,760
couple of them as well yeah but how we

833
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,500
really need to sketch a model around it

834
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,060
that's the most important part you could

835
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,679
have say oh they actually you know

836
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,359
distributed Alicia score which has a

837
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,760
capability to actually make the system

838
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,339
go useless yeah it's okay but what is

839
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,260
the whole model around it right if you

840
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,639
really need to build track models we

841
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,839
really need to understand the attack

842
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,879
model and of course we can transform

843
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,520
that into an impact model as well I was

844
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,500
going to impact and that's what we are

845
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,099
going to talk today in this context

846
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,619
so when again our rehydrated so because

847
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,480
it's a really different Concept in the

848
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,400
context of Cyber Wars I've been using

849
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,859
the term digital weapons but again I'm

850
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:03,720
gonna talk a little bit more about it

851
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,060
with different context as I mentioned

852
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,700
earlier we they really went ahead and go

853
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,280
for subverting the Integrity of the

854
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,740
compromise systems but right now there

855
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,300
are other characteristics in this case

856
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,700
as well disrupting economic functions

857
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,040
right production consumption and growth

858
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,859
by targeting those systems or for

859
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,900
example if we talk about you know

860
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,359
critical infrastructure systems you know

861
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,180
web hmis scada systems and all that they

862
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,460
can even go after that which also

863
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,440
involves if we extend that definition

864
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,839
the critical infrastructure it includes

865
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:37,980
the banking systems financial

866
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,400
institutions civil liberty uh websites

867
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,020
and many load of course including

868
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,640
military and government organizations as

869
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,900
well

870
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,940
another Target in this case is to impact

871
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,619
the network availability which is an

872
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:50,820
important part

873
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,980
which also have an indirect relevance to

874
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,720
how they you know impact the data

875
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,579
because your systems go useless there's

876
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:59,339
no point of extracting data they just

877
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,220
simply disrupt the state of uh you know

878
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,540
existing data components and of course

879
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,740
and if they all go pretty well they're

880
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,060
really going to go after intellectual

881
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,560
property in that case which all falls

882
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,780
into the data exfiltration data stealing

883
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,359
data hijacking and then okay I want the

884
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,220
intellectual property I want more

885
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,220
information about rather critical

886
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,079
infrastructure system is still alive or

887
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,180
not so when I say this statement what

888
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,579
exactly I mean by cameras network

889
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,859
cameras right and that are connected to

890
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,839
the internet or if you have compromised

891
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,760
a certain system and having an access

892
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,500
from that system to those critical

893
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,480
cameras and seeing whether the critical

894
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,339
system or infrastructure how they are

895
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,079
operating we take a look at it and

896
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,460
you'll get a free locket what I'm

897
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,500
talking about

898
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,740
but here uh what I'm presenting right

899
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,540
now here is the proper model of

900
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,820
understanding digital Wars specifically

901
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,460
in the context of data so when they go

902
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,440
after they have you know different

903
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,300
things to choose from right it could be

904
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,060
Data Destruction as I mentioned they

905
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,460
sabotage the systems they make the data

906
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,200
use less completely ineffective in

907
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,359
nature I don't want that data I just

908
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,520
want the systems to be completely

909
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,680
impacted

910
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,240
they can also think about that

911
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,160
acceleration like why not I mean if I'm

912
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,320
into the system let's just extract the

913
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,900
data it could be intellectual property

914
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,420
critical data you know

915
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,220
we've talked more about a little later

916
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,200
but I show you the examples of that in

917
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,060
the real world and of course denial of

918
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,060
service this impact the network till we

919
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,200
figure it out how we are going to

920
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,820
compromise the system let's just keep

921
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,640
impacting the availability so when I

922
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,500
talk about availability in that concept

923
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,320
we know when everybody goes to uh the

924
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,060
course for computer engineering and even

925
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,940
the basics of security CI model right

926
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,500
confidentiality integrity and

927
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,480
availability so it's a broad and

928
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,579
holistic concept if you look at it and

929
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,500
you can everything can fall back into it

930
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,920
if you put proper pictures and proper uh

931
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,680
boxes into it uh explaining what it is

932
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,599
all about so in this case there is

933
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,160
availability I'm going to impact the

934
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,720
availability systems will not be

935
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,500
available

936
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,900
is going to solve my purpose and then

937
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,880
what we have seen in that nation-step

938
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,240
cyber conflict as well

939
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,040
so let's take a look into the Data

940
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,720
Destruction the model that we have

941
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,220
discussed like kind of digital weapon

942
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,960
being used in that space right so in

943
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,700
this case is called whisper build you

944
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,800
might have already seen it but we also

945
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,900
try to look into it we saw that you know

946
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,380
how it is all right so what happened in

947
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,660
that is this malware has a capability to

948
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,880
install itself into the system of course

949
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,099
but it is designed in such a way that it

950
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:36,780
can actually manipulate the kernel our

951
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,579
drivers because then let's say for

952
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,440
example Windows operating system if you

953
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,599
really need to Tamper the boot uh

954
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,099
processes and all that you need to have

955
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:46,020
that kind of privilege or you might have

956
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,300
some another exploit way to transform

957
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,339
the code from a user line into the

958
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:51,900
kernel and so that you can actually

959
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,119
manipulate the boot records and that's

960
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,859
what what they did they simply made it

961
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,140
corrupted so they just triggered the

962
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,359
reboot command every time the command

963
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:03,240
was triggered system was not able to you

964
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,060
know boot properly and it just go into a

965
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,640
a stake where it cannot be taken back

966
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,980
but it is was a part of the Data

967
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,260
Destruction process us that what we have

968
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,780
seen that is also called as an infection

969
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,480
so in this part we have seen how Discord

970
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,820
has also been used we have earlier seen

971
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,040
that you know we have discourse cdns are

972
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,020
heavily used for specific type of

973
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,119
attacks they come up with the CDN then

974
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,619
they you know actually put up some kind

975
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,780
of malicious script in there and because

976
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,359
he's the CDN and everything is included

977
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,579
into web pages through JavaScript lines

978
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,260
and they just fetch these scripts and

979
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,000
rendered in a browser to do different

980
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,920
kind of activities maybe you know just

981
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,020
you know exploiting some kind of thing

982
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,359
in the browser component Librarians or

983
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,579
just finding one or the other way to get

984
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:49,800
into the system but even in this case

985
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,540
what we have found that the whisper

986
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,240
weight malware uh again I'll use the

987
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,700
digital weapon they actually distributed

988
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,760
it why this called CDN as a one of the

989
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,220
infection Vector so you can clearly see

990
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,619
like all these Technologies rather the

991
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:07,260
new new word messaging systems like this

992
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,420
called telegram the back-end sporting

993
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,099
infrastructure they have like CD games

994
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,500
and how they Disobedience and then they

995
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,839
actually you it like a JPEG some sort of

996
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,119
stamiography and all that thing in

997
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,040
certain variants and when you actually

998
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,140
fetch that thing into the code and how

999
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,660
the cdns like push that code outside it

1000
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,099
started getting infected targeted

1001
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:27,960
against the specific

1002
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,560
um systems on the internet and again the

1003
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,420
question here is that you know they can

1004
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,700
do wiping they can do other things so we

1005
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,460
talk about making the system completely

1006
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,980
useless we talk about the impactions

1007
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,440
where they are like wiping code and you

1008
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,380
know just you know making certain files

1009
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,119
on the system go useless which are

1010
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,060
critical in nature and things like that

1011
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,079
but that was a real part so again now in

1012
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,339
the model we talk about data

1013
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:58,740
acceleration so this is the samples we

1014
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,980
took from the some you know actual

1015
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,480
traded data I don't want to go too much

1016
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,339
detail into it but I want to give you

1017
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,800
the glimpse of it you know what was lead

1018
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,200
during that time so this is the kind of

1019
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,540
blueprints for us several Power and

1020
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,579
energy corporations right

1021
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:17,820
so if nation state cyber conflict is

1022
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,380
happening in addition to the real world

1023
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,060
conflict it's all about energy and power

1024
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,099
at the end of the day but you can

1025
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:25,380
clearly see you know these documents

1026
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,420
right I mean they contain so much

1027
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,760
information that it just it's just even

1028
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,280
hard for us to actually analyze it but

1029
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,140
we put up in this case to highlight what

1030
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,820
is exactly happening in the back end so

1031
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,859
we talk about intellectual property now

1032
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:39,839
I mean I don't know whether it's really

1033
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,000
secure or not right but we have seen

1034
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,579
this kind of uh you know data being you

1035
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,020
know being distributed in the

1036
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,240
underground cyberspace uh which we

1037
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,460
discussed earlier as well

1038
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,680
another example of the data exfiltration

1039
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,780
so these are the blueprints typically

1040
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,200
highlighting how a big and a critical

1041
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,820
infrastructure works so this is much

1042
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,800
more related to the electric systems and

1043
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,900
the Power Systems that were running in

1044
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,720
one of the nation state uh but it was

1045
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,220
all leaked as a part of their cyber

1046
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,960
attempts right because of scada systems

1047
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,359
and critical systems who are compromised

1048
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,040
and this is just a tip of the I score

1049
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,540
but I'm showing you right now this is a

1050
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,940
much much more to it but it is very

1051
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,480
critical and uh I don't think so

1052
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,980
even it's like as I mentioned earlier

1053
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,540
it's very tough to analyze these kind of

1054
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,400
documents in a short period of time

1055
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,320
but it's all happening this is the world

1056
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,040
of cyber world if you ask me and at the

1057
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,200
end of the day we use technology but how

1058
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,900
it is being abused day night we exactly

1059
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,579
presenting in front of you how exactly

1060
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:40,859
it is being done

1061
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,099
another example of the data exfiltration

1062
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:45,480
so I have put up the things but you can

1063
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,820
clearly get an idea and the point that I

1064
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,800
mentioned and we discussed earlier as

1065
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,680
well like why exactly it is important

1066
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,300
during these nation-state cyber

1067
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,339
conflicts of the real world conflicts to

1068
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,920
get an idea about how your critical

1069
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,819
system is operating so these screenshots

1070
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:05,280
are taken from the compromised cameras

1071
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,319
and which actually stores these

1072
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,720
screenshots into the local systems which

1073
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,060
actually got compromised as well so once

1074
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,560
the system is compromised you can get a

1075
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,480
data from there or those network devices

1076
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,920
are storing that data onto the

1077
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,859
compromise system but I'm just you know

1078
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,480
highlighting the impact of this stage

1079
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,880
you can clearly see how these the you

1080
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,680
know

1081
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,780
I think it's from the gas from primarily

1082
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,579
some of their infrastructure and you can

1083
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,140
clearly see how these things are being

1084
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,460
you know structured running in the

1085
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,160
remote locations on the globe but you

1086
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,780
can still figure it out somewhere

1087
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,760
sitting in a remote location and you

1088
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,680
have all that information this is the

1089
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,599
impact of Cyber Wars this is the impact

1090
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,819
of how data is extracted now

1091
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:48,480
and it is very problematic but at the

1092
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,579
same time you can clearly see

1093
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,500
how good the infrastructure looks like

1094
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,859
right and another screenshot in this one

1095
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,119
is very critical

1096
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,300
so just imagine uh I'm extending this uh

1097
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,740
you know thread model to the next level

1098
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,180
you know if you're able to get a

1099
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,040
screenshot of these cars that are you

1100
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,839
know parked there and you have all these

1101
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:08,220
kind of their numbers and win numbers

1102
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,980
you can clearly figure it out by

1103
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,720
checking those numbers somewhere some

1104
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,060
point of time where it actually belonged

1105
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,680
to and you can have more information

1106
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,780
starting from the one compromise system

1107
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,000
and you can see where you actually go

1108
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,680
through it's all happening it's very

1109
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,359
problematic and it's very critical in

1110
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:25,200
nature

1111
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,780
and again I took these screenshots from

1112
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,460
the net blocks a great website to

1113
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,560
actually analyze how the data basically

1114
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,660
the network connectivity goes and it's

1115
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,400
fall into the category of impacting

1116
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,140
availability that is denial of service

1117
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,599
attacks net blocks like how the specific

1118
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,119
regions during that time were impacted

1119
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:44,060
and completely taken off the internet

1120
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,800
and Cloud impacts the state even

1121
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,660
actually if your internet goes down for

1122
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,520
like five minutes ten minutes it has a

1123
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,260
great impact right communication is

1124
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,780
broken and you know economic functions

1125
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,300
are also broken to a real extent but

1126
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,940
this is a model that is a very important

1127
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,680
in the context or when we talk about

1128
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,200
data data disruption that exfiltration

1129
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,300
and then denial of service impacting

1130
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,460
availability at the core but that's the

1131
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,680
world that we live in and it's happening

1132
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,780
all across

1133
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,020
so in the conclusion in the context of

1134
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,240
nation state cyber conflicts and you

1135
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,060
know Cyber Wars so it is very important

1136
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,640
to defend nation-state cyber

1137
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,220
space against targeted attacks

1138
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,020
using digital value they are actually

1139
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,060
utilizing digital weapons but the

1140
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,240
defending is really required right now

1141
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,920
whether a community can come together

1142
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,660
build some tools that can be utilize

1143
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,119
organization need to enhance their code

1144
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,460
but exactly at the end of it this is the

1145
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,800
need of the art and what I've simply

1146
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,480
showed you during this you know

1147
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,099
presentation is just not only a two

1148
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:48,720
percent it's just basically a two

1149
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,579
percent I would say it's like 98 is

1150
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:52,560
still sitting somewhere hidden somewhere

1151
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,020
but you can still see the impact of this

1152
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,040
uh you know research and why is needed

1153
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,780
and why people like us to actually do

1154
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,460
this kind of research to educate

1155
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,680
audience and educate ourselves as well

1156
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,720
right we might be thinking the world is

1157
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,400
like you know oh this is not happening

1158
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,380
in the world the global world right now

1159
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,180
but it's all happening

1160
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,480
and it's the need of the R so in

1161
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,599
conclusion in this research what we have

1162
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:20,460
realized during this uh you know in the

1163
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,140
last one year which we are spending this

1164
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,119
research is like you know future belongs

1165
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,579
to those who own the data

1166
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,319
it's a very simple thing it's not about

1167
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,300
you control it you can't even control

1168
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,280
our own data right I mean look at what

1169
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,560
we have seen during this research

1170
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,359
so much of the transactions are

1171
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:38,099
happening billions and trillions uh you

1172
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:39,359
know number of transactions that are

1173
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,099
happening every month

1174
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,859
I mean and the problem is that how much

1175
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:46,140
from the authorization boundary con your

1176
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,480
concept how much data is going out of

1177
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,180
the authorization boundary and what is

1178
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,500
the visibility that we have in that

1179
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,280
space right so as I said it's all not

1180
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,140
only true for the attackers it's always

1181
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,940
true for the organizations as well

1182
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,520
whoever gonna have more data they are

1183
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,500
going to build more of the solutions

1184
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,180
and the last point that I want to make

1185
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,280
during this research and in conclusion

1186
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,260
in that case is that adversaries are

1187
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,880
building Advanced Digital weapons to

1188
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,859
launch an apps which is happening all

1189
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:16,079
across so the security Community should

1190
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,359
respond at the same level so we have to

1191
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:20,579
up our slaves as well and build more

1192
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:22,859
robust uh security prevention and

1193
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:25,380
detection Solutions and use intelligence

1194
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,940
to the greater level

1195
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,339
and in the last part I say we all

1196
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,380
believe that Aries human human are prone

1197
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,359
to errors so we really need to make sure

1198
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,280
how we can reduce our mistakes and that

1199
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,900
and just have a little bit more

1200
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,900
proactive approach to our own data and

1201
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,599
making sure that if you can actually use

1202
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,599
a little bit of Sami air gap of systems

1203
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,700
we are doing exactly you know hold the

1204
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,560
data with specific systems and not to

1205
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,599
use one system as overall I think it

1206
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,240
helps a lot with that I hope this

1207
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,520
research you know have some impact and

1208
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,339
you might have to you know enjoyed it as

1209
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:01,380
I said much more to it maybe next time

1210
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,200
uh thanks everyone and thanks for

1211
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,359
attending this talk thank you very much

1212
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:09,140
thank you

1213
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,359
any questions or questions

1214
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:15,359
foreign

1215
