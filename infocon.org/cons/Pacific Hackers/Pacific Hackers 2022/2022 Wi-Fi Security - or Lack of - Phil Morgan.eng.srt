1
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,180
a little bit in the middle

2
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,600
that great building

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,599
we stood over there and they say share

4
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,619
screen

5
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,660
and the zoo says oh well you have to

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,640
have permission to do that so I'm like

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,340
okay here's commission and it says you

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,239
have to reboot right security is so

9
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,640
inconvenient right yeah okay you stay

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,160
that way yeah

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,519
so this talk

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,559
is a whole security provided by Wizards

13
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,719
we all we'd all like to be Wi-Fi Wizards

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,399
I do the Wi-Fi wizard thing because my

15
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,379
dad his actual name was Merlin like the

16
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,360
Welsh wizard so

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,980
um I really am an understanding of

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,739
murder well anyway

19
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:08,820
uh I'm Phil Morgan I am the e-i-e-i-o

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,740
so many people say that they're the CTO

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,500
or the CFO I decided I want to call

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,799
myself the EIEIO fans of Old MacDonald

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,000
May recognize

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,520
the hard way

25
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,939
okay this is a little bit about my

26
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,979
company I work for the NC expert we do

27
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,560
development training lots of things I'm

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,880
not going to bore you with this you can

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,560
watch the video or look at the slides or

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,220
whatever

31
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,140
uh this is me I've been doing Wireless

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,479

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,460
uh this is how you contact me if anybody

34
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,140
does want to reach out to me I actually

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,960
would like you to do that we do a lot of

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,479
development for a lot of companies we

37
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,220
are currently developing a project on

38
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,259
threat hunting for a large company but

39
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,840
I'm not allowed to name if anybody knows

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,780
threat hunting a lot or really well I'd

41
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,880
love to hear from you please so reach

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,399
out to me here's the information I'll

43
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,020
present this at the end to either take a

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,818
screenshot whatever but if you are

45
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,679
really good at threat hunting please let

46
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,640
me know

47
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,500
okay let's do this

48
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,000
I do have to say that what I'm going to

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,160
talk about

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,040
is real uh we have to do this the legal

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,260
consequences what I tell you if you use

52
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,000
it to break into the Pentagon it's your

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,739
fault not mine right

54
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,239
I'm not going to actually give you that

55
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,160
much information so you can do that but

56
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,840
it's a simple step from what I'm going

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,780
to tell you into actually doing this

58
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,819
let's talk about the basics

59
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,140
so

60
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,540
I firmly believe that inconvenience is a

61
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,640
hacker's best friend okay whenever I say

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,800
it's very inconvenient I want you all to

63
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,720
shout out inconvenience as a hacker's

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,160
best friend let's make this uh

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,959
participation

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
I firmly believe we are not paranoid

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,680
enough really really we need to be more

68
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,959
paranoid I firmly believe that you can't

69
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,480
fix stupid just like Mrs Gump said we

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,540
can help it a little bit and longer

71
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,800
passwords are generally better than

72
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,220
complex password last words okay

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,980
let's talk about the CIA not that one

74
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,080
the other one everybody knows about the

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,879
pillars and you all I'm assume are the

76
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,519
basics understanding that we talk about

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,239
confidentiality integrity and

78
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,220
availability we also care about

79
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,099
non-repudiation and authentication okay

80
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,019
very important yeah we know that okay

81
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,300
are they all important well you decide

82
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,940
do you need all three are you happy to

83
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,640
go with just two of them your call right

84
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,819
okay sometimes in Chinese authenticity

85
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,800
availability are good enough but you

86
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,680
also need confidentiality your call okay

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,420
what do I mean you're not paranoid

88
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,860
enough it's really simple we're not

89
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,019
proud enough what I wanted to do was I

90
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,540
wanted to present a QR code and I wanted

91
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,180
to let you click the QR code but I was

92
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,860
told by legal that I couldn't possibly

93
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,260
do that so what I'm going to do instead

94
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,959
is warn you not to click this QR code

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,480
okay then I'm going to do something and

96
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,400
I'm going to click the QR code

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,459
ready okay don't don't you can't get

98
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,299
this at your choice ready

99
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,239
right

100
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,939
when Jackie showed us a QR code when

101
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,659
Jackie showed

102
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,119
that wasn't supposed to happen yeah

103
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,600
It's a Wonderful World it really is when

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,340
Jackie shows the QR code you're

105
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,020
perfectly safe right when you're

106
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,000
starting a restaurant and the menu is

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,100
selectable by the QR code

108
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,759
you possibly aren't be careful what QR

109
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,860
codes you link to we need to be a little

110
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,840
bit more paranoid

111
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,060
did anybody click hopefully not I did

112
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,080
you saw what happened and that's all

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,759
that does the way it just it takes you

114
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,759
to a tiny URL link that links you to a

115
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,740
YouTube video

116
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,240
so first of all I want to talk about

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,060
wireless wireless is

118
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,759
as safe as ethernet okay some would

119
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
argue it's safely you sure felt well let

120
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
me emphasize something that you may have

121
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,840
missed Wireless when configured

122
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,199
correctly is a safe position and that is

123
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,400
a big win okay I guarantee you that

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,220
wireless isn't completed correctly okay

125
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,380
in many many cases

126
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,500
problem with Wi-Fi but on top of Wi-Fi

127
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,240
wireless particularly what we use to

128
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
connect with the coffee shop at home at

129
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,500
the airport on the plane computer how

130
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,580
many of you are connected by our

131
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,720
ethernet today

132
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,180
I rest my kids you're always connected

133
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,479
by a Wi-Fi

134
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,060
and that proves that there's always an

135
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,220
exception to the rule

136
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,780
all right thank you

137
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,460
the issue with wireless is you broadcast

138
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,699
it not broadcast like the Ethan athlete

139
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,440
you said a broadcast friend it is

140
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,699
broadcast from a device out and anybody

141
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,280
that has a receiver can hear it that is

142
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,160
the point it is a broadcast media

143
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,259
I want to clarify something that a lot

144
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,240
of people really don't understand

145
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,100
they understand that if you turn up the

146
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,960
volume on the speaker

147
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,120
more people can hear the volume what we

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,680
don't understand is you can also turn

149
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,919
the volume up on the listener okay

150
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,500
boundary of a network being too far away

151
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,740
is never a security mechanism right

152
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,259
just because you cannot hear the signal

153
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,259
outside of a predetermined area it

154
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,660
doesn't mean that I can't hear the

155
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,960
signal outside the same area if I use a

156
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,319
different antenna combination I can hear

157
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,960
your signal more loudly I can bring it

158
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,759
into your Wi-Fi network from half a mile

159
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,680
away you don't know where I am you don't

160
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,780
know I'm doing it but I just need line

161
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,699
of sight and hopefully not a building in

162
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,400
the way okay so if you're being hacked

163
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,780
and there's a gripping open space

164
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,699
outside your building try looking in

165
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,680
that direction right because if I'm

166
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,360
going to attack you if one is going to

167
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,460
be attacked I should say

168
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,620
well Wi-Fi is the easiest way to do it

169
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,900
absolutely easiest way to do it there

170
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,400
are real monsters out there in the world

171
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,960
and we can protect ourselves from them

172
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,440
okay uh one of Olga says guys like

173
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,419
nobody's watching but encrypt like

174
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,419
everybody is I think I'm preaching to be

175
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,220
quiet here I think everybody knows we

176
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,080
need to encrypt our data we put it

177
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,180
multiple times in this morning

178
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,740
so a couple of things to understand

179
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,020
about Wi-Fi and Phil you're talking

180
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,360
about Enterprise Wi-Fi like what we do

181
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,340
in the business not home Wi-Fi it's

182
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,840
exactly the same thing no difference

183
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,160
whatsoever

184
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,560
there are two ways to use wireless wi-fi

185
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,919
and only two ways without security and

186
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,080
with security the end

187
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,419
what do you mean without security

188
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:42,180
at Starbucks I should mention names at

189
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,180
coffee shops at airports

190
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,000
on airplanes anywhere you don't have to

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,460
do anything else other than just connect

192
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,280
then that's a Network that has more

193
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,460
security cycling okay it's not a bad

194
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,259
idea because it's the way we use guest

195
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,500
networks but we uh maybe you want to

196
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,940
read the signal

197
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,819
you probably use Captain portals

198
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,280
how many people here work in a company

199
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,680
that has a gas Network an actual guest

200
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,400
Network okay how many people here

201
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
have a guest network with the captain

202
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,699
portal

203
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,160
how many people hit copy of photos

204
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,500
what yes the same people have put their

205
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,879
hands up for how many people have

206
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,199
account report they put their hands up

207
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,720
for and those people who didn't put

208
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,860
their hand up because they had coffee

209
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,319
photos use Captain photos not support

210
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,200
them as an I.T administrator right

211
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,940
it's not a problem with the captive

212
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,679
portals it's a problem with our apples

213
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,779
and our Androids and everything else

214
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,000
they want to serve us and they want to

215
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,219
eagerly connect to us

216
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,440
and they always try and connect us

217
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,959
quickly and they try and detect that

218
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,940
it's a cafe portal and they do stuff

219
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,360
that messes up captives portals right so

220
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,880
at the moment Cafe portal is still the

221
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,100
way you secure a network that's all and

222
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,260
basically but to explain what is the

223
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,760
capital portals you go to the coffee

224
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,800
shop you connect you open your email

225
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
doesn't work nothing works you open a

226
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,160
web browser to try and get some help and

227
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,959
it says oh hello welcome to Coffee Shop

228
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,940
Network do you promise to you do the

229
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,279
following thing to be nice be kind not

230
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,860
download nasty stuff or illegal copies

231
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,260
of Spiderman trip yes I click you click

232
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,399
yes and now you're allowed to connect

233
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,779
right that's a captive book

234
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,740
so let's talk about some Basics these

235
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,000
are people you need to understand and

236
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,500
know about in the Wireless World in the

237
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,260
Wi-Fi world the FCC are in charge of

238
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,000
power levels

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,700
and frequencies and what channels you

240
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,279
use the IEEE are most famous for

241
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,220
creating the standard and amendments

242
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,980
the real people who do the real work you

243
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,560
care about is the Wi-Fi Alliance that a

244
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,300
vendor group that creates certifications

245
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,700
so if you want to buy a device that does

246
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,500
something you want to buy it with the

247
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,000
WFA the Wi-Fi Alliance

248
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,100
certifications okay uh the real power is

249
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,300
the I tripling so when you're talking

250
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,440
about the I triple you rule everything

251
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,480
no how many of you use the attitudinal

252
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,459
and I if you want to go anybody use the

253
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,800
editor alumni protocol you're all using

254
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,140
it right now okay only it's not called

255
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,660
in a 2.1 right it was rebadged by the

256
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,940
Wi-Fi Alliance it's WPA2

257
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,220
how do I use in WPA team who connected

258
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,899
to the Pacific hackers

259
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,060
uh necessity and typed in a password

260
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,000
WPA2 right 802. alumni exactly the same

261
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,640
the ietf creates some stuff that we use

262
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,440
and reuse so we don't want to reinvent

263
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,140
the wheels or the radius protocol the

264
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,000
heat protocol and used by those guys and

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,019
cows

266
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,060
so as I mentioned the two sorry I

267
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,440
mentioned there's two ways to use a

268
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,019
Wi-Fi with security and without security

269
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,920
there are two year ways to use Wi-Fi

270
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,399
security according to the WPA2 standard

271
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,440
okay certification I should call it

272
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,300
standard in the sense that it's a

273
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,100
standardized thing that we use it's not

274
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,140
a legitimate standard it is a

275
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,240
certification but only people like me

276
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,500
who work in the industry would be really

277
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,060
care about that

278
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,519
is personal and his Enterprise

279
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,500
personality type and appreciate key

280
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,300
Enterprise you connect to some sort of

281
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,120
complex radius server and you type in a

282
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,459
username and a password you don't go to

283
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:15,540
certificate and all sorts of other

284
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,360
things so here we see we have

285
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,339
without security

286
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,980
we can keep our Mouse movement

287
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,839
and on the on the right on the left we

288
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,000
have with security so there's only two

289
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,980
options personal with appreciate key

290
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,320
which is what we all did today and

291
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,240
Enterprise which is probably what you do

292
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,380
in the office however you go in the

293
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,959
office your machine had to be onboarded

294
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,000
by a team you turn it on something

295
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,620
magical happens it pops up and says

296
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,180
what's the username and password you

297
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,620
type your username and password and it

298
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,540
says yes and everybody's happy right but

299
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,519
it's a much more complex way of using

300
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,980
Wi-Fi how many of you use Enterprise

301
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,380
grid Wi-Fi at home

302
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,420
um you can see the smile on my face you

303
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,940
do see it there's always an exception

304
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,920
that man is probably the smartest man in

305
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,220
the room okay because you are well it's

306
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,440
difficult to break into his network but

307
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,060
other people know but of course you have

308
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,860
to have a radio server or some kind of

309
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,779
Radio Service which you aren't going to

310
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,540
install at Grandma's house right oh you

311
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,700
are but how's she going to maintain

312
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,320
please understand that only the people

313
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,019
on the left hand side

314
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:21,720
only people on the left

315
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,360
have any sort of security well the

316
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,940
people on the right are sending data in

317
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,500
plain text

318
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,120
over the internet

319
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,060
okay so if you're in a coffee shop I can

320
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,980
read all your emails I can see all your

321
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,480
passwords and everything and that's the

322
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,220
course you're using

323
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,920
SSH because you're probably smart enough

324
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,560
to not use telnet from the office for

325
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,380
folks like from the coffee shop you're

326
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,760
using

327
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,120
some kind of SMTP with a TLS link you're

328
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,339
using

329
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,800
um pop three or

330
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,300
I've got the other one part three or

331
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,339
some kind of way to read your emails or

332
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,200
no Phil I'm using a VPN thank you very

333
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,360
much right again that's the way we need

334
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,000
to do it when you're using anything that

335
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,339
does not do the four-way handshake you

336
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,160
have no security at all other than

337
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,560
security that you use by using a VPN or

338
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,620
using https not HTTP and stuff if you

339
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,240
make a voice call and it's not encrypted

340
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,459
to secure voice and this is stuff that I

341
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,139
saw people in classes and in

342
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,240
demonstrations we make a voice call that

343
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,740
I replay the voice book because if it's

344
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,500
not sentencrypted it's sent open and if

345
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,740
you're on a voice call from your device

346
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,420
at the coffee shop if you're using Skype

347
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,399
or Whatsapp or any of those they're

348
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,260
going to be encrypted today okay if

349
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,060
they're not anybody can hear it

350
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,380
you take the passwords uh May the force

351
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,100
be with you that passphrase is mixed

352
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,200
4096 times disabled devices right over

353
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,720
the top of the most interesting thing oh

354
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,279
I like what I said I didn't it doesn't

355
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,399
say 4096 times oh I apologize it's there

356
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,019
it mixes it 4096 times with the SSID to

357
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,120
sort the passphrase and give you what is

358
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,920
known as the pre-shared team that is the

359
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,139
preset key that is used in the protocol

360
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,459
to let you onto the network

361
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,060
uh WPA2 personal notification key you

362
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,279
have a common password entered manually

363
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,279
or calculated from a passphrase

364
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,500
everybody who knows the passwords can

365
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,940
access the network and decrypt the

366
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,700
traffic so I can capture all the traffic

367
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,620
that you were sending over the wireless

368
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,620
network very easily and I know the

369
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,260
password right so I can de-encrypt all

370
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,300
your traffic and you can decrypt each

371
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,100
other's traffic and you can decrypt my

372
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,959
traffic which is probably a good idea

373
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,019
why you should all be running a VPN

374
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,399
or https or not Talent you are with me

375
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,779
you understand we need to be more

376
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,019
paranoid this is now pre-shared keys are

377
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,639
perfectly safe

378
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,940
pause common

379
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,279
as long as you change the password every

380
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,480
30 days

381
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
so the calculus doesn't have to do that

382
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,320
because it's on the wall okay if they

383
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,760
want to change it they just reprint it

384
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,399
on the wall okay hacker Georgia doesn't

385
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,480
have to do that they can change you

386
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,380
whenever

387
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,180
the problem with pre-certainty is if you

388
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,339
use it in the office and you don't

389
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,560
change the password ever when somebody

390
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,540
leaves the company they know the

391
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,740
password

392
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,920
which means they can capture your data

393
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,560
and connect to your network and you

394
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,300
decide which one is more scary

395
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,160
you have to use a serious level of

396
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,160
complexity I believe they say that today

397
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,620
you should be using 18 19 20 character

398
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,300
passwords it's the first thing you're

399
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,800
going to do when you use a 20 cargo

400
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,760
password

401
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,560
you're going to write it down

402
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,720
there's the problem if you use a

403
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,380
password use a 26 card or password uh

404
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,060
May the force be with you

405
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,480
space Phil Morgan at ampersandi

406
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,459
okay that's very easy to remember I can

407
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,019
ask you what what the password was at

408
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,220
the end you should all be able to

409
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,019
remember let the force be with you yes

410
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,959
Bill Morgan

411
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,399
very easy to remember you don't have to

412
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,480
write it down

413
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,560
okay

414
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,320
the problem is all of these things are

415
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,339
very inconvenient inconvenience

416
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:19,500
best friend

417
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,300
so the four-way handshake is a very

418
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,920
convolutely complex I can give you the

419
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,240
short version because you don't want to

420
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
sit there for 20 minutes while I explain

421
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,720
it you take the passphrase and you mix

422
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,060
it up with the SSID

423
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,820
and that becomes the pre-shed

424
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,180
this is a 64 byte value as the pre-shed

425
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,339
key cut in half and that becomes notice

426
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,320
something called the pmk the pairwise

427
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,860
master key variable if you use the WPA

428
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,779
to Enterprise version

429
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,699
as a result of a successful

430
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,220
authenticated connection you get a

431
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,440
master session the master session key is

432
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,060
again manipulated into the same size of

433
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,600
the pmk it's 256 bit key the pmk is then

434
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,120
shared it is shared or known or

435
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,339
calculated on the client called the

436
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,439
supplicant on the left

437
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,319
and on the

438
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,020
infrastructure the access point on the

439
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,679
right

440
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,959
they then exchange some data before we

441
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,939
handshake that there are four steps

442
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,439
before we handshake they're really

443
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,819
clever these security people you know

444
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,040
the name before we handshake the access

445
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,140
point includes a random number of nodes

446
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,959
the client now knows the pmk

447
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,119
it knows its own random number it knows

448
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,040
the access point random number you know

449
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,600
the supplicant's MAC address it knows

450
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,580
the access points the authentic papers

451
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,760
Mac address mixes them all together and

452
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,679
creates the pairwise transient key

453
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,200
there's a that's a big key that is split

454
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,059
up to make other keys

455
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,700
it then sends its random number

456
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,799
with a little bit of basically a fancy

457
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,140
psychic redundancy check calculation

458
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,419
back up to the access point the access

459
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,880
point has what it needs it now creates

460
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,100
hopefully the same pairwise Transit team

461
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,200
the TK is the temporal key that's used

462
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,000
to encrypt all the data

463
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,980
the other keys are used for other things

464
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,539
you don't even worry about

465
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,600
the broadcast key is encrypted in the

466
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,520
third key you want a second we have a

467
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,460
unicast key for unicast data

468
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,080
what if I want to send a broadcast frame

469
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,940
or a multicast frame so there's a second

470
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,860
key that has to be generated and shared

471
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,960
that's the broadcast key now this shared

472
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,059
in Exchange number three and then

473
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,380
Exchange number four and give it a

474
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,299
thumbs up we're good everybody's happy

475
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,160
now key point if you use WPA2 personal

476
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,160
appreciate the key everyone every time

477
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,640
they connect are using the same psk and

478
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,220
therefore have the same here

479
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,100
everyone every time they connect

480
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,799
if I read your passphrase I know your

481
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,120
pmk

482
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,900
I own your network now in the past and

483
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,480
forever if I capture data you transmit

484
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,400
today I can go away and I can break your

485
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,840
appreciate field and I can break the

486
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,240
beer that I captured today in a year's

487
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,460
time in 10 years time

488
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,160
in 20 years time okay so if you were

489
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,440
doing anything important and you used to

490
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,640
appreciate until you you probably

491
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,260
shouldn't be

492
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,320
short passphrases are very very easy to

493
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,240
crack talk to the guys who sat in the

494
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,520
wireless class yesterday they nodding we

495
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,799
broke Wireless passwords yesterday okay

496
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,600
now they were caught they were simple

497
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,220
passwords they were designed to be

498
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,080
easily broken they are very easily

499
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,320
broken

500
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,580
anybody know what a time ago what our

501
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,900
point of God she is

502
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,660
anybody have one yes maybe we have more

503
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,059
than one I have four yeah

504
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,980
uh it's a little Raspberry Pi

505
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,700
zero

506
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,840
you you feed it reset keyed

507
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,179
uh four-way handshake exchanges

508
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,580
it's like the game from the 90s there's

509
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,559
a bit of information there from you what

510
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,660
it does it captures

511
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,620
WPA2 handshakes captures pmk IDs stores

512
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,220
there was a p-cap if if it's bored if it

513
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,840
gets lonely and bored it starts the

514
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,940
identificating people to make them

515
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,320
reconnect because when they reconnect

516
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,640
the first thing they do is they do the

517
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,039
voyage okay it uses artificial

518
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,299
intelligence to learn how to get better

519
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,100
well office intelligence machine

520
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,720
learning we have another conversation

521
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,120
about what you do

522
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,919
I'm going to mention in a minute can it

523
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,380
travel back in time to kill you no then

524
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,640
it's machine learning like it's not

525
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,559
African

526
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,799
uh watch out if you do use this it

527
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,179
sounds like a fun little try but maybe

528
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:37,620
you shouldn't take it to the airport you

529
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,580
shouldn't take it on the police station

530
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,140
you shouldn't take it into a military

531
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,000
base and so on so forth because it will

532
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,980
stop doing the authentication attacks as

533
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,780
that capturing keys right you can put

534
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,640
that in polite mode where it just simply

535
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,340
collects and collecting anything that is

536
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,200
broadcast I don't know if anyone

537
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,480
understands the law or as a lawyer or

538
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,700
anything but if you broadcast something

539
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,179
openly into the air and I capture it I'm

540
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,320
not entirely convinced that anything

541
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,919
legal okay because you broadcast it so

542
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,900
if you take this onto one of these sites

543
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,460
they probably will make a fussy if they

544
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,860
got you if it's just capturing stuff no

545
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,080
big deal but you don't want it

546
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,520
de-authenticate him and disconnecting

547
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,200
people on a military base in a

548
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,120
government building or something like no

549
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,559
you don't even turn up the DMV right

550
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,059
don't don't do that

551
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,679
uh everything you want to know you can

552
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,260
go there did a talk on it back in

553
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,620
Pacific hackers uh it's on the video on

554
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,080
the YouTube there's a link to it it was

555
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,659
a long talk about lots of questions

556
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,539
how to build one from scratch and it's a

557
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,280
great little toy to play with you want

558
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,780
to learn about what if you want to be

559
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,419
able to capture uh four-way handshakes

560
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:43,679
easily

561
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,080
but there are alternatives to using

562
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,179
giving everybody the appreciate key I

563
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,520
call this I.T to be shaky it's a name I

564
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,980
made up only the it must appreciate here

565
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,320
and when you want to connect you take

566
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,600
your device to the IT department and

567
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,940
they type in the preset key for you no

568
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,380
need to change the patient key as often

569
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,940
you'll need to change the password when

570
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,200
someone leaves the company but you don't

571
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,820
need to decommission the device to get

572
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,400
the key off it still must be a serious

573
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,620
level of land and complexity or devices

574
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,880
that need to be taken to I.T for

575
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,159
onboarding or decommissioning these are

576
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,280
all very inconvenient inconvenience is

577
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,900
that yes

578
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,580
it's another way of doing this the

579
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,799
vendors have caught on to now and it's

580
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,940
but there's different brand there's a

581
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,360
different names but ppsk or iepsk or

582
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,179
mbsk basically it's personal pre-shaped

583
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,520
keys so appreciate you it's just the

584
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,380
past spreads to the password

585
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,299
you don't have to have one of them so

586
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,640
you get everybody their own picture

587
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,740
and this is genius

588
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,659
because you don't have to change we

589
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,200
should be so often them

590
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,880
just say hey Bill use this one whenever

591
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,960
you're ready this one's going to retire

592
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,039
in a month

593
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,559
you don't need a commission

594
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,880
decommissioned devices when somebody use

595
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,840
the company you just delete their

596
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,580
appreciate anyway

597
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,179
uh it does of course lead to

598
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,919
someone's going to manage this there's

599
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,080
an extra level of management you still

600
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,500
should use a serious level of complexity

601
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,700
uh maintenance that I mentioned could

602
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,280
require some overhead uh doesn't

603
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,960
completely work with the latest

604
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,320
Technologies wpa3 today so it's not the

605
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,059
perfect solution just yet but it's a

606
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,640
short-term solution for WPA2

607
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,740
uh it's also a great solution for gas

608
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,140
networks when someone arrives you can

609
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,419
just create a random password for them

610
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,919
or

611
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,740
password 73 or whatever and give it to

612
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,059
them on a little sticky label print it

613
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,039
out give them a little sticky label and

614
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,419
they can take it with them so it's all

615
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,220
great alternative of gas networks

616
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,380
because now the guest network is using

617
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,360
the pre-shed key concept which means you

618
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,340
do have encryption so no one's walking

619
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,679
around your network inside your building

620
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,020
quite often because the problem you've

621
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,700
got now is what other people capture

622
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,980
them on your network it's a whole other

623
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,360
legal issue that somebody else can deal

624
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,740
with

625
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,740
when you move on to WPA to Enterprise it

626
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,720
uses the Electoral I I call it attitude

627
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,580
at 1X e radius it's based on the head

628
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,860
into the One X principle using the E

629
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,440
protocol and using the radius server

630
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,039
okay so a supplicant on the client

631
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,919
on the left talks an authenticator which

632
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,020
is the

633
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,000
Wireless infrastructure the wireless LAN

634
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
controller which is Cisco or Aruba the

635
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,860
cloud if you're Meraki missed or extreme

636
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,799
and so on and the access points

637
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,260
on the back end is a radius server that

638
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,700
is the interface that stores the

639
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,740
usernames and passwords we don't use

640
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,200
various to store the username and

641
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,840
passwords today we most likely interface

642
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,020
that over to an ldap Microsoft active

643
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,760
directorism does anybody know what

644
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,440
radius stands for

645
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,100
remote

646
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,140
dial in

647
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,900
user service right you mean more damage

648
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,700
yeah it was invented for the use of

649
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,340
modems okay but technically you're

650
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,900
dialing in

651
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,940
when you connect to the Wi-Fi so why

652
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,799
reinvent the protocol it's the same

653
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,380
concept so we today we use the radius

654
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,400
concept

655
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,440
to authenticate but instead of storing

656
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
usernames on the radio server we

657
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,340
actually use the interface usually

658
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,900
Microsoft applicant directory is like

659
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,240
the largest most widely used form of

660
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,539
ldap in the world

661
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,760
uh so Enterprise requires the use of

662
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,620
even radius will need to use

663
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,260
certificates or a Cisco variation of

664
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,600
something called U plus devices will

665
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,820
need to be onboarded you have to onboard

666
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,100
the certificate you have to install a

667
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,100
certificate somehow by group policy or

668
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,620
manually to allow them to authenticate

669
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,179
the certificate that is given to you by

670
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,159
the radius server this can be very

671
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,960
inconvenient now here we go again

672
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,080
arguably the safest mode of wi-fi

673
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,740
security today

674
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,100
pause when configured correctly how many

675
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,799
of you use WPA to Enterprise in the

676
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,120
office

677
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,220
how many of you didn't put your hand up

678
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,779
because you're smart enough to not tell

679
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,059
me what security you use in Wi-Fi on the

680
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,539
off right yeah remember we aren't

681
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,400
paranoid enough okay

682
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,580
don't worry about it it's very easy if I

683
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,080
stand outside your office I listen to

684
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,760
your broadcast from your access points

685
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,220
on beacons I know exactly what security

686
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,260
we use in you because you advertise it

687
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,840
to me okay 10 times a second so I know

688
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,820
how to connect to you I have but we

689
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,860
don't turn on broadcasts as well yeah

690
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,659
that means you don't advertise the name

691
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,240
of your SSID you still advertise it

692
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,039
people who sat on the hacking class

693
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,900
yesterday did we do anything about that

694
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,580
yes we did we just waited till somebody

695
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,520
comes along so hide in broadcast doesn't

696
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,440
mean you don't be good it means you

697
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,080
don't advertise the SSID name now any

698
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,480
hackers going by are like huh why are

699
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,320
these people hiding why are they not

700
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,360
advertising the SSID name what are they

701
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,919
hiding them so you've now picked their

702
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,480
interest right and all they're going to

703
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,039
do is sit there and wait long enough

704
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,840
because the vehicle has been I'm not

705
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,100
telling you who I am but there's a

706
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,020
network here I'm not telling you who I

707
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,120
am but there's a network here I'm not

708
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,559
telling you who I am but there's a

709
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,360
network here and then Joe turns up to

710
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,919
work on Monday morning says are you

711
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:12,539
their secret Network and the access

712
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,120
point says yes there we go welcome to

713
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,580
secret Network come on in to see if just

714
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,919
give away your SSID there right and we

715
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,840
did this yesterday in the hacking class

716
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,279
it's real easy to do because I don't

717
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,539
have to do anything with it you just

718
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,700
load if anyone wants to know you load um

719
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,059
aircraft NG air Mon and you put the

720
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,520
interface in monitor mode and just one

721
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,320
arrow down and it'll sit there and it

722
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,120
will say hidden network and then it'll

723
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,919
say oh not a hidden note anymore because

724
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,080
it literally looks for beacons and tells

725
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,700
you what they are so it looks for probe

726
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,559
responsive and probate question tells

727
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,860
you what the hidden network is

728
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,480
problem is the Enterprise this is quite

729
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,919
possibly the dumbest thing I've ever

730
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,260
ever invented and it's up there with a

731
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,520
lot of gun things

732
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,200
when users are presented with a

733
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,539
certificate that's invalid they have the

734
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,419
option to say continue anyway which is

735
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,120
quite possibly really really not smart

736
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,820
Okay uh

737
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,640
you don't allow it you can configure

738
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,480
group policies in Microsoft I'm not a

739
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Microsoft person I have an apple I know

740
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,860
a little bit about Microsoft but I'm not

741
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,799
a huge Microsoft admin person uh you can

742
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,980
do MDM control with like Meraki or jamf

743
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,779
on Apple and you can say that people

744
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:27,480
aren't allowed they aren't allowed to

745
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,059
not use this certificate this is the

746
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,500
only certificate that is allowed to

747
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,140
connect them to secret Network any other

748
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,059
certificates are not allowed that's

749
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,799
probably like a really good idea but

750
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,039
does anybody know if they do this

751
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,480
some of you maybe don't know some of you

752
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,279
may be I'm not going to put your hand up

753
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,140
because you like oh we need to stop

754
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,480
doing that sure it's fine

755
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,000
all of this here we go again can be

756
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,720
really inconvenient

757
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,539
so I told you about the foreign

758
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,100
handshake that is used with WPA to

759
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,640
Enterprise that is used for WPA2 uh

760
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,279
personal appreciate the key key point to

761
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,059
understand if you use WPA to Enterprise

762
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:14,580
everyone every time you connect

763
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,419
as a unique msk and therefore you have a

764
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,299
unique payment

765
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:23,940
okay so all the Wi-Fi attacks we did

766
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,740
in the class yesterday and most Wi-Fi

767
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,480
attacks that are done against you are

768
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,120
done against the pre-shed key

769
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,340
it's much more difficult to do attacks

770
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,940
against not impossible against WPA to

771
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,059
Enterprise okay you can do a taxi in WPA

772
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,559
to everybody but nobody in their right

773
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,539
mind is going to attack the ptk

774
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,640
that's going to take a lot of processing

775
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,039
power and break

776
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,240
the pastries or the ptk you got when you

777
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,799
signed in at nine o'clock when you

778
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,299
logged up at 10 o'clock to go for a

779
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,320
coffee break or to go to the meeting

780
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,720
when you come back at 10 30 that's a

781
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,360
different ptk you won't see that so

782
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,620
hackers aren't going to bother to attack

783
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,919
that they attack other aspects all right

784
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,679
so wph3 magical unicorns

785
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,620
Gonna Save the World we have a tfwp3 one

786
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,020
two three hold on thank you thank you

787

gigahertz anybody have a 16 US device

799
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,899

805
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,480
stuff please my Samsung S21 has done six

806
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,600
gigahertz for two years okay my iPhone I

807
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,159
thought oh this year this this October

808
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,899
this is when I buy no the iPhone doesn't

809
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,940
do six again we now have an iPad or six

810
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,039
gigs so we're getting there slowly see

811
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,020
six gigahertz it's not going to happen

812
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,539
tomorrow it's going to take time how

813
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,100
many of you have a laptop the secrets a

814
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,240
year and a half old

815
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,039
and don't get a new laptop for another

816
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,539
year and a half maybe

817
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:31,980
so you've got to wait a year and a half

818
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,240
when you get in your life it'll probably

819
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,740
be a six gig us laptop when you get

820
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,360
there I have a doubt if anyone wants to

821
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,500
come talk to me come and talk to me I'll

822
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,659
show the model of gal that I bought you

823
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,340
take the back off you plug in an Intel

824
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,080
chip and now it does six gigahertz it's

825
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,179
not a six gigahertz antenna it's not the

826
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,620
best six gigahertz but it's six

827
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,779
gigahertz right I have a Samsung that's

828
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,419
60 degrees we're getting that and now we

829
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:54,240
have six gigahertz on the ceiling at the

830
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,100
door job fantastic

831
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,260
this is going to happen and there's a

832
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,480
lot of typical and I jokingly said at a

833
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,820
conference I was at four years ago let's

834
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,799
skip six gigahertz and let's go to Wi-Fi

835
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,260
seven and everybody groaned and

836
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,940
somebody's actually suggesting that in

837
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,039
the industry broad coming into we're

838
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,559
gonna have Wi-Fi seven chips out next

839
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,500
January I believe so people are really

840
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,020
uh don't even go there people come talk

841
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,820
to me if you want to offer to us go for

842
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,380
six gigahertz now six gigahertz is going

843
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,000
to become ubiquitous in about two or

844
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,880
three years Wi-Fi set uh

845
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,580
so let me clarify six gigahertz is Wi-Fi

846
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,320
six in

847
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,679
okay ax is white by six ax and six

848
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,820
gigahertz is Wi-Fi six e Wi-Fi seven is

849
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,080
really three years away from being

850
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,240
standardized and probably six years away

851
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,159
from becoming ubiquitous just a long

852
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,299
wheel

853
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,179
anyway back wpa3 wpa3 is the next

854
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:50,100
generous the Next Generation Wi-Fi

855
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,080
security it really is for rainbows and

856
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,779
unicorns it simplifies enhances security

857
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,940
robust authentication increased

858
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,520
increased cryptographic strength it

859
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,620
stops using protocols we shouldn't be

860
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,200
using anymore like tkip it requires

861
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,179
something called pmm

862
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,039
I don't even know this but all of you in

863
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,679
the room unless you're using wpa3 which

864
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,960
I don't doubt if anyone is I can

865
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,760
disconnect you from the network real

866
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,120
easy okay I say to you hey insert your

867
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,500
name here

868
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,299
please disconnect this is your access

869
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,059
point speaking please disconnect now and

870
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,580
you all go okay

871
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,519
because that's the way Wi-Fi works right

872
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,220
attempted management frames uh where we

873
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,260
have a negotiated remember if you look

874
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,179
let's look back a little bit just really

875
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:37,980
quickly

876
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,500
these little spare on the right hand

877
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,019
side the right to TK is a little spare

878
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:46,140
keys that aren't being used well we have

879
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,220
a use for them

880
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,279
they are used to create peas they will

881
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,380
be used to create special milk values

882
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,860
whenever someone says Mac or Mac not as

883
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,360
a MAC address but as a Mac

884
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,760
authentication board whenever they use

885
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,740
Mick in that course it's a fancy CRC

886
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,360
it's a really glorified second

887
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,760
redundancy check what happens is when I

888
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,260
said to the message saying hey insert

889
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,480
your name here disconnect

890
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,599
here's our secret password if I don't

891
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,399
use the secret password or I use the

892
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,280
wrong secret password you go no I'm not

893
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,780
going to disconnect it's that simple

894
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,179
okay pmf is required in wpa3 so how many

895
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,399
of you have ever happened to Wi-Fi

896
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,659
how many of you ever happy with the

897
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,760
Wi-Fi but don't admit it how many of you

898
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,260
have done a d authentication attack on

899
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,800
Wi-Fi okay nobody sure I believe that

900
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,080
um I know that three of you in the room

901
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,960
did it yesterday with me so right uh the

902
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,179
point is you can't do that anymore

903
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,980
anybody ever have a problem in work

904
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,239
where they keep on getting the offense

905
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,820
Again by somebody else because Meraki

906
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,320
and myths will do this if they detectors

907
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,820
go to a rogue AP they would

908
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,619
deauthenticate you but the problem is

909
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,179
it's kind of illegal to do that if it's

910
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,699
a legitimate AP and if he's using the

911
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:00,000
name of their SSID it's open season but

912
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,740
pmf just stops that

913
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,680
protection of management frames

914
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,560
uh the problem with wps3 is there's a

915
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,480
transition mode because we always have

916
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,920
to be nice to those people who haven't

917
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,040
caught up yet it's not fair to limit to

918
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,980
only connect the wpa3 so we're gonna

919
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,380
allow people if they don't support wpa3

920
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,440
just say they don't support wph then we

921
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,680
will use wpat anybody see any problems

922
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,200
with that any issues

923
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,500
I turned on wpa3 and the hack judges

924
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,820
simply comes along and says oh I don't

925
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,859
support wps3 and the input should say

926
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,480
well let's turn off all this fancy stuff

927
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,240
then and let's use WPA too then right

928
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,520
oops

929
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,220
uh it's gonna have more protection for

930
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,520
users easier secure onboarding

931
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,740
higher level protection on open networks

932
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,760
so that's really cool we'll talk about

933
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,160
in a minute and optional 192-bit

934
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,660
security for those people who are really

935
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,900
paranoid that the military government

936
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,980
I think you didn't know over double

937
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,060
three you didn't know about

938
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,339
diffie-hellman

939
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:05,579
ecdh SAE and owe isn't actually a part

940
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,579
of wps3 but it's coming along with it

941
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,820
uh what wps3 does it separates the

942
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,500
creation of what we talked about as the

943
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,079
pmk do you remember pmk that is now

944
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,540
separate from the pre-shared key

945
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,200
this one step makes wpa3 infinitely more

946
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,740
secure as of July the 2020 wpa3

947
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,300
personalized required for Wi-Fi six

948
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,480
operation wp3 Enterprise and owe it's

949
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,720
optional that's going to change

950
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,460
so quick summary

951
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,400
but all those need coffee break wpa3

952
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,859
fixates the problems with WPA2 and it's

953
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,140
super duper megals

954
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,060
it started with something called crack

955
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,520
that was an easy way to attack Wi-Fi

956
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,540
networks okay invented by uh Mark Ivanov

957
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,920
and uh uh emac District

958
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,079
it was a way to force the access point

959
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,900
to reuse a previously used random number

960
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,660
which might not seem like a big deal but

961
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,040
when you have an infinite possibility

962
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,660
using you reduce them to a small number

963
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,640
of possibilities and you have a lot of

964
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,460
processing power it's a huge deal

965
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,099
so what's wrong with WPA2 so up in the

966
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,900
top right hand corner there

967
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,119
let me just point something out I'm here

968
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,280
talking at the Pacific hackers so I'm

969
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,380
not a crypto billionaire anyway

970
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,780
clarify that now but I did build a

971
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,660
crypto machine and it made ethereum and

972
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,760
it made ethereum still made a lot of

973
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,560
theater until a month ago they stopped

974
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,359
doing it that way so now I have this

975
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,099
machine with all these graphic card it

976
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,540
costs about two thousand dollars to

977
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,760
build it's a lot of money but

978
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,579
ask my wife do you mind him doing this

979
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,619
she's like well it's cheaper than gold I

980
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,060
got to see him an awful lot more so

981
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,980
she's happy today because he doesn't do

982
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,520
nothing now does it well

983
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,320
we did a session about a month or two

984
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,420
ago with Irving with hashcat

985
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,119
needs a lot of Crossing power oh can you

986
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,220
get Husker to run on your old crypto

987
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,990
mining machine Phil yes I can

988
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,480
[Music]

989
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,820
took give you an idea and those who

990
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,920
understand people understand it it took

991
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,680
three minutes to break the WPA2

992
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,900
passphrase

993
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,900
with a dictionary attack on my Kali

994
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,660
Linux there's a VM on my laptop

995
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,660
when the word was 700 000 words in the

996
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,579
dictionary it took

997
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,380
three and a half hours to do a

998
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,520
dictionary attack

999
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,020
on my

1000
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,320
academics when the word pastors was an

1001
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,599
eight character word that was nine

1002
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,520
million words in the dictionary anybody

1003
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,200
want to guess how long it took this to

1004
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,980
Brute Force the password

1005
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,200
0.26 seconds now hold on time out timer

1006
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,140
it was a capital letter followed by six

1007
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,940
lowercase letters followed by a number

1008
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,700
and this device broken in Northwest and

1009
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,920
it wasn't a dictionary attack it was a

1010
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,960
Brute Force attack if you have an eighth

1011
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,220
character appreciate key on your network

1012
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,839
and you think you're safe come and talk

1013
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,280
to me later kind of a little chat about

1014
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,940
it right 0.26 seconds okay

1015
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,040
I thought it was broken I started up I

1016
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,140
went for coffee I came back no I've done

1017
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,880
it oh my gosh even I was surprised at

1018
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,260
how quick it did it

1019
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,599
so and of course the point was I broke

1020
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,940
that past phrase offline

1021
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,040
I sort of said it was my network it's

1022
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,359
the rest of the building captured a

1023
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,339
four-hand check went home did this in

1024
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:24,839
the comfort of my home

1025
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:28,520
once I know you appreciate King

1026
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,980
I'm the king right

1027
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,320
wph2 also lets you not use security and

1028
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,940
of course it uses crack let me just

1029
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,099
clarify

1030
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:41,880
WPA2 lets you not use security no think

1031
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,260
Luke I am your father no don't try not

1032
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,140
to do that okay sometimes you have to I

1033
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,000
understand but we'll see if we got a

1034
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,220
solution coming up with that in a minute

1035
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,140
uh so there must be a problem this is

1036
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,760
2022 we're going to go to Mars there's

1037
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,740
all sorts of stuff you do know that

1038
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,020
you're anybody have an eye watch or a

1039
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,640
Samsung Watcher thing you know that's

1040
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,200
got more processing powers of 1960

1041
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,359
supercomputer you know that right so a

1042
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,180
lot of power in the watches your iPhone

1043
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,099
this little apple it's the the one with

1044
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:14,400
or the M2 you know the M1 Pro Max or

1045
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,020
something this has got more Crossing

1046
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,200
power I think than 1970s supercomputers

1047
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,820
okay

1048
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,740
we have machine learning and there's the

1049
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,200
reference I told you about you know uh

1050
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,300
Ai and machine learning like the

1051
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,640
cyberdyne system anybody knows cyber 2

1052
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,440
million right there is actually a

1053
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,060
company called cyberdyne system you all

1054
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,260
know that right

1055
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,099
coincidence or prophecy your call

1056
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:41,160
no nothing we can do we can't fix WPA2

1057
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,000
use stronger and longer passwords and

1058
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,099
try not to write them down That's all

1059
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:49,140
folks that's all we go

1060
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,740
so wpa3 was designed to fix all of this

1061
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,660
it's resistance to offline dictionary

1062
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,280
attacks stronger protection against

1063
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,960
password guests and attempts for

1064
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,180
technology if you can see it I I thought

1065
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,220
oh I shouldn't say stupidly easy

1066
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,099
passwords then I went to delete it and I

1067
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,200
thought well I need to mention that some

1068
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,660
people use stupidly easy passwords so I

1069
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,520
compromised and pretended to cross it

1070
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,440
out okay right

1071
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,320
even if users you stupidly easy

1072
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,119
passwords one two three four five six

1073
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,760
seven eight they get better encryption

1074
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,940
with wpa3 personal with that password

1075
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,200
then you got ever before with WPA2 okay

1076
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,000
so if you have a stupid password it

1077
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,140
means people can get on your network

1078
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,940
they can't decrypt your data anymore

1079
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,359
that's that's like a wow okay

1080
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,339
it provides forward secrecy so if I

1081
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:40,260
capture your data now

1082
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,760
I can't guess you appreciate key in 10

1083
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,800
years time and reverse engineer your

1084
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,380
data I have to attack the key that was

1085
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,960
used to encrypt the data not attack the

1086
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,240
key that was used to create the key that

1087
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,099
is used to encrypt your data that is a

1088
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,660
big thing

1089
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,420
and the changes are invisible to users

1090
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,579
however you need device support you've

1091
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:03,780
got to have devices

1092
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,300
so you can't use wpa300 device it

1093
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,579
doesn't support it now just quick story

1094
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,940
I turn on wpa3 on the Euro computers at

1095
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,880
my house okay my son says my iPad

1096
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,119
doesn't work anymore no like any self

1097
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,220
operating I.T administrator I

1098
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,180
immediately thought there's something

1099
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,040
wrong with this iPad

1100
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,960
then my daughter said my iPad doesn't

1101
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,420
work anymore and as any self-respecting

1102
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,359
I.T individual I went oh I made a change

1103
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:31,740
and now two things don't work you think

1104
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,839
it was me it usually takes two for that

1105
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,060
to happen right and I went okay so I

1106
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,980
turned off WPS and I said does it work

1107
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,380
now they will send yes it works and I

1108
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,900
said can you please

1109
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,099
patch to the latest version of soccer

1110
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:46,140
from Apple and they did and I turned

1111
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,960
w383 back on and it worked again they

1112
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,339
didn't even need me to go and buy new

1113
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:54,000
iPhone iPods I'm sorry iPads they just

1114
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,400
updated and I was quite embarrassed and

1115
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,540
I probably shouldn't tell that story

1116
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,140
that sure I said children they're well

1117
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,000
above teenagers

1118
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,400
um children

1119
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,400
I'm still professional didn't have to

1120
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,859
hit the uh iPads for a couple of years

1121
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:14,040
and yeah I didn't share one but how many

1122
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,500
people you have kids

1123
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,060
how many people here keep your hands up

1124
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,960
if your kids listen to you

1125
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,300
so this is invisible to users but you

1126
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,880
have to upgrade the devices to support

1127
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,619
it and usually it's a software upgrade

1128
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,240
it's not always a hardware if you can

1129
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,680
check that we need time

1130
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,540
oh okay we're getting there

1131
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,359
so wpa3 personal in the past phrase only

1132
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:38,099
provides Authentication

1133
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:41,520
SAE will replace the pre-shared key for

1134
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,740
the encryption SAE will negotiate with

1135
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,920
pmk then run the forward handshake SAE

1136
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,460
will exchange sorry the SAE exchange is

1137
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,859
resilient to passive active attacks also

1138
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:54,900
resilient to offline dictionary

1139
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,540
now if you Google SAE you end up with

1140
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,940
that now that's not the essay any

1141
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,520
mechanics you might get that job it's

1142
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,819
car oil uh the internet you have to

1143
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:07,260
search for civil training certification

1144
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,460
of equals it provides forward secrecy

1145
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,500
it issue with the pmk cannot be

1146
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,660
recovered even if the password becomes

1147
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,920
known right update of July this year

1148
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,960
wpa3 support is mandated for Wi-Fi Six

1149
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,119
certification

1150
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,700
wpa30 is the only option in Wi-Fi 6 here

1151
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,680
wpa3 support is mandated in the Wi-Fi

1152
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,020
Six certification so we saved now aren't

1153
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,579
we

1154
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:40,140
nope all right so it's from the editor

1155
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,260
LMS mesh peering protocol based on

1156
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,520
dragonflight you will learn more about

1157
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,880
it uh why this this is an old slide if

1158
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,220
you updated WFA has made a good

1159
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,160
replacement in the pre-shed key

1160
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,260
um but it doesn't do authentication you

1161
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,119
are

1162
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:59,040
securely encrypted to the other side we

1163
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,540
don't know who they are it's a start

1164
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,520
we'll work on it

1165
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,460
you need to understand both of you you

1166
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,619
pick color I pick a color we've got a

1167
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:09,960
common color we mix them together we

1168
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,240
send the mixture and the common color

1169
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,060
across the network we each receive the

1170
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,460
other person's mix mix it with our color

1171
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,319
that we kept secret so you pick a common

1172
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:22,920
color and a secret color okay you mix

1173
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,619
them send the mix over the public

1174
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:28,980
network there is no way

1175
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,640
it's very it's very very difficult for

1176
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,680
anyone intercepting

1177
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,160
the colors that you send to reverse

1178
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,140
engineer it to get back to your secret

1179
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,560
color okay you might fill yellow and red

1180
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,780
make orange it's not hard yes but you

1181
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,060
don't know the exact

1182
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,200
who

1183
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,680
color saturation blah blah blah blah of

1184
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,119
the color

1185
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,579
of the gazillion colors that they can be

1186
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:00,060
you don't know the exact one okay Tiffy

1187
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,940
helmet is based on finite field discrete

1188
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,680
logarithmet anybody understands find

1189
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,000
that field these people algorithms Don't

1190
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,220
Be Afraid yeah some people do because

1191
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,560
you're the guys and gals who write the

1192
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,200
code absolutely

1193
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,780
40 000 foot View

1194
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,400
it's

1195
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,740
it's very difficult to reverse engineer

1196
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,260
creates a keyed one-way function it's

1197
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,780
completely computationally expensive or

1198
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,420
infeasible to calculate the key using

1199
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,800
only the input and the output you were

1200
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,599
given right so it's a one-way system

1201
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,220
that's really really difficult to

1202
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,619
reverse engineer so you can't get this

1203
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:37,800
hidden color it's it you can't you

1204
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,180
everybody knows you can't use the word

1205
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,339
impossible in security right it's

1206
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:42,780
impossible for someone finds a way to

1207
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,880
break it but I press the processing

1208
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,579
power on the supermarket we didn't do it

1209
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:49,819
well you need to know one more thing

1210
00:46:49,819 --> 00:46:52,619
elliptive curved with your helmets are

1211
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:55,260
even even better and way more super

1212
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,200
duper than Jiffy helmet okay you just

1213
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,460
need to know the elliptive curves are

1214
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,280
cool

1215
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,260
oversimplification like drawker if I

1216
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,960
have a calculation I can draw a curve

1217
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,440
if I then choose a point on the Curve

1218
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,300
be it it's reflection

1219
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,980
if you're a tangent to create Its

1220
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,359
Reflection between the tangent greatest

1221
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,119
reflection and I rinse and repeat you

1222
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:19,940
don't know where my starting point was

1223
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,260
and you don't know

1224
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,480
what my the number of times that I

1225
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,680
iterated that

1226
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,500
so it's even more even more difficult to

1227
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,900
reverse engineer elliptic curvedity

1228
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,400
element there is

1229
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,800
logarithmic difficult okay anybody

1230
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,000
understand the limit occurred if you

1231
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,680
haven't don't think I do I just repeat

1232
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,619
about running a website yeah some of you

1233
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:43,099
do good

1234
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,079
uh so remember the four-way handshake

1235
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,720
okay I'll put it before you handshake is

1236
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,660
the sorry the input the Fourier is the

1237
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,980
pmk

1238
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,740
and that has gotten from the msk or the

1239
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,280
pre-shared key well what we do is we do

1240
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,700
a special exchange at the start of wpa3

1241
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,420
and we create a pmk using a lifted

1242
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,099
curved if you help them

1243
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:10,380
so we no longer have any relationship

1244
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,180
with the preset key

1245
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,819
with the pmk so if I calculate or I

1246
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,160
guess you appreciate key all I can now

1247
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,619
do is connect to your network I can no

1248
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:22,980
longer decrypt your data all right

1249
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,599
right we still do the following

1250
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,339
handshake at the end exact same for your

1251
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:29,460
hand chip but the pmk that we input is

1252
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,079
calculated from the dippy Holman

1253
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:35,220
exchange not from the pre-shared key

1254
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,579
now every one every time they connect

1255
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:40,319
have a unique

1256
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,200
pmk correct

1257
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,560
uh wp3 also updates WPA2

1258
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,960
uh I think it introduces the management

1259
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,119
frames which at least stop Dr from the

1260
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,339
associate attacks in the tracks

1261
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:55,680
if you ever want to sit in a hacking

1262
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,119
class for Wi-Fi go do it quick because

1263
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,140
they're not gonna be able to do this so

1264
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,900
much longer uh it's invisible to users

1265
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,640
but you need device support there's an

1266
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,859
optional 192-bit cryptographic strength

1267
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,480
for those who really are paranoid

1268
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,760
government military financials so on so

1269
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,300
forth and you cannot turn off pmf which

1270
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,380
is like

1271
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,480
thank goodness for that right

1272
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,060
typically we create something and we let

1273
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,740
people turn it off which is a stupid

1274
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:24,540
idea you cannot disable pmf in wpa3 in

1275
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,619
Enterprise

1276
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:28,520
all in Christmas

1277
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,660
uh other things that come out something

1278
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,520
called Wi-Fi enhanced open which is just

1279
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,020
super duper

1280
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,760
remember we talked about you connect the

1281
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,140
network there are two ways well now

1282
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,480
there's a third way look in the middle

1283
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,880
owe in the middle here

1284
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,099
you can see my mouse moving owe in the

1285
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:45,359
middle

1286
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,480
it's an open network but it runs the

1287
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,220
four-way handshake

1288
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,800
so you have encryption unique encryption

1289
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,800
for your connection that no one can

1290
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,200
reverse engineer so now you can go to

1291
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,720
Starbucks coffee shops this part of

1292
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,220
their session sponsored by Star Market

1293
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,900
you can go to your coffee shop your

1294
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,819
airport whatever so you can connect to

1295
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,740
an open network and having encrypted

1296
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,900
data no authentication right you don't

1297
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,520
know is the coffee shop you're connected

1298
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,099
to but you have a secure and encrypted

1299
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:20,040
difficult to break link with that access

1300
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,319
point to encrypt your data I know better

1301
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,300
than to say unbreakable because someone

1302
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,099
will proved me wrong very soon so now

1303
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:27,119
there's

1304
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,760
there's with security and without

1305
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,920
security and without security but still

1306
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,020
can be good okay it's kind of a halfway

1307
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,760
house

1308
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,339
so the ow process you do a normal

1309
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:40,440
authentication as in Wireless you

1310
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,119
connect when you do the association

1311
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:44,339
phase there's a special oh look it's an

1312
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:45,660
old friend a lift of curved if your

1313
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,880
helmet okay and it does elliptical if

1314
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,040
you have an exchange in the ow exchange

1315
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,760
to give you encrypted keys

1316
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,800
so now everyone every time they connect

1317
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,059
to an open network has a unique pmk even

1318
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:01,619
if they aren't connected

1319
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,240
but it's even if they are connected to

1320
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,559
open network and even if they didn't

1321
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,440
want one you get one as long as devices

1322
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,119
supported okay

1323
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,740
that's the caveat with all this new

1324
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,140
stuff devices have to support it

1325
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,640
it's coming hero like hero wpa3 yes

1326
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,500
fantastic

1327
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,960
all right so today our options are open

1328
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,339
networks web WPA WPA2 personal wp2

1329
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:29,339
Enterprise wps3 personal WP is the

1330
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:32,339
enterprise we haven't got book Network

1331
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,900
okay

1332
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,000
so when that was safe now right well if

1333
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,040
you have an open network you've got the

1334
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,260
door if you're using web

1335
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,760
you shouldn't

1336
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,359
okay you know you can break WPA2 and WPA

1337
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,319
too personal

1338
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,500
well what about the last three well

1339
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,380
you can break them as well right

1340
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,319
I broken WPA to Enterprise

1341
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:57,359
when it wasn't configured correctly a

1342
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,940
broken wpa3 personal when it wasn't

1343
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,680
configured correctly

1344
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,319
we I broke the wpsv Personnel when it

1345
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,720
was configured in transition mode

1346
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,880
so probably don't run it in transition

1347
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,800
board

1348
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,619
I couldn't break wpa3 when I broke WPA2

1349
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:15,540
a customer and then showed them there

1350
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,800
was a stupid idea to use the same

1351
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,359
passphrase on wp83 whoopsie right

1352
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:23,400
wpa3 this is theoretical never done it

1353
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,440
never seen it heard about it if you

1354
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,020
don't configure wpa3 Enterprise can be

1355
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,480
broken okay it's much more difficult if

1356
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,339
you use the anime 2-bit one because that

1357
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:34,260
will not let you use anything with epls

1358
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,520
certificates and it's very difficult to

1359
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,540
put

1360
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,940
drop tips use the webs know your

1361
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,980
environment know what is normal know

1362
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,960
what is abnormal

1363
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,319
use some kind of DNS security one of the

1364
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:47,940
first things malware usually does when

1365
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,619
it gets on your system is reaches out to

1366
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:51,300
a commander control server we saw this

1367
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,099
this morning people demonstrated this

1368
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:56,160
well if your dnf system says you know

1369
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,319
what I'm not letting you connect into

1370
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,800
nasty virus please dot are you no I'm

1371
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,839
not letting you do that that's a huge

1372
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,059
bonus okay additional interface with

1373
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:07,880
like baraki for example

1374
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,040
and uh usually imagine on technical

1375
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,540
management frames which means you have

1376
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,300
to use the new new protocols which means

1377
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,859
you need support for the new protocols

1378
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:20,819
so key takeaways use wpa3 do not use

1379
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:22,859
transition mode uh if you do use

1380
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:24,900
transition mode everything becomes WPA2

1381
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,240
use a different SSID for each frequency

1382
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,240
use a different SSID for WPA2 wpa3

1383
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,339
clients don't use the same pre-shared

1384
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:36,540
key on WPA2 and wpa3 ssids but fell last

1385
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,200
time these are so inconvenient

1386
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,400
last couple of things a couple of

1387
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,740
comments clean application

1388
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,660
if I come and sit outside your home

1389
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,599
tomorrow it's 100 miles away you will

1390
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:51,420
still advertise for Pacific hackers

1391
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,700
because you're connected to it so I'll

1392
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,859
set up my AP to be specific hackers

1393
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:58,319
you'll gladly connect through it and

1394
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,700
give you internet connectivity and now

1395
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,920
I'm capturing all the data on the wired

1396
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,920
side not the wireless side right

1397
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,619
uh I can find you from your probes okay

1398
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,180
be paranoid be careful what you plug

1399
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,220
into something don't don't go to

1400
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,140
airports and plug your phone into a USB

1401
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,180
charger at the airport like you're

1402
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,760
falling into a USB power bank let me

1403
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,579
plug that into your phone okay

1404
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,559
um to learn more you can look at this on

1405
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,859
the website and what a time

1406
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:27,059
um

1407
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:28,800
we do a class on this if anyone's

1408
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,660
interested reach out to me a two-day

1409

I am done and oh I just a more deeper

1412
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,540
talk on this episode hackers about six

1413
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,920
months ago

1414
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,599
yeah

1415
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:47,940
