1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,639
sure today we had we had the privilege

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,040
having Jackie

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,560
um he has any grandma and an aggressive

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,420
background

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,400
um and

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,920
um the reason why we decided to bring

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,380
her in because she won't know as a

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,019
person that has strong opinions and she

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,220
is uh

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,220
uh maybe I should have one of her friend

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,000
subscriber

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,100
I was so cheap without filter

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,440
uh so not right there I said we don't

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,640
filter okay

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,020
so

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,059
um uh she has an impressive background

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,920

72
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,459
we've been doing it now for a while we

73
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,640
want to basically create more so

74
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,500
um

75
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,379
population today

00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,159
so please

77
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,239
um basically if you go to meetup.com

78
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,360
hackers you'll be able to see the actual

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,580
content of our videos we do have an

80
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,260
online platform by the way for those of

81
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,640
you who are

82
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,860
at zero

83
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,860
we do have an online platform that

84
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,260
basically will guide you through what we

85
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,500
believe is the basics and the minimum

86
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,720
that you need to get a job in cyber

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,239
security so basically we aim to turn you

88
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,120
into a soft one analyst as they give you

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
the operations Alloys is usually the

90
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,840
first job that most people get inside of

91
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,239
security if they get higher from there

92
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,040
you can choose if you want to be a pen

93
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,920
tester if you want to be a blue teamer a

94
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,380
red teamer there will be all kinds of

95
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,899
subjects if you actually look

96
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,820
um at the Meetup page and you are able

97
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,740
to see the past meetings we do have a

98
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,600
curriculum it's not a form of curriculum

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,699
but it's definitely some of the subjects

100
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,979
that we believe will get you there

101
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,440
um ready yes all right so here we go

102
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,240
Jackie I don't know how to how to start

103
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,280
talking after that intro I guess I have

104
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,680
no filter apparently that's that's a

105
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,900
theme

106
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,820
nice nice to see you guys um so I'm

107
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,800
Jackie Maguire thanks for having me

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,259
um I am so honored to be here

109
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,720
um I can't I can't explain how much I

110
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,240
love working in cyber security and the

111
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,860
entire reason that I love it is one it's

112
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,320
this never-ending puzzle to solve but

113
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,940
the people that you meet working with

114
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,580
security are the weirdest nerdiest

115
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,520
smartest coolest people

116
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,080
um being a little bit neurodivergent

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,720
myself I really identify with a lot of

118
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,180
the personalities and security

119
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,940
um so it has I've had more fun working

120
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,460
in security than any other job but I

121
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,380
want to actually tell you guys about how

122
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,780
I got into security because I think most

123
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,120
people who come into cyber security

124
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,460
don't do so directly very few people end

125
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,440
up in here uh and end up in this

126
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,580
industry

127
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,240
um

128
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
the traditional way so I got my start

129
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,580
sorry it was my zoom bar

130
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,139
um I got my start with computers when I

131
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,160
was little

132
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,380
um I grew up pretty poor and my mom

133
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,120
would go grocery shopping with me in

134
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
this strip mall that had a Radio Shack

135
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,300
on the end in it three or four years old

136
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,100
she would literally just drop me off a

137
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,320
Radio Shack and then go grocery shop and

138
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,880
the guys at Radio Shack were nice enough

139
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
to teach me how to use a computer so I

140
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,259
used to mess around with Windows

141
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,000
um on their computer for an hour or two

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,460
every week so I kind of had access to a

143
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,500
computer from a pretty young age and

144
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,060
then my mom started law school when I

145
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,100
was nine and again no money for a

146
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,660
babysitter so she parked me in the

147
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,180
computer lab at the law school so

148
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,740
um people at the law school were really

149
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,240
nice and taught me how to use a printer

150
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,940
they taught me how to use a mouse and a

151
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,440
keyboard and I remember the first time I

152
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,300
moved an icon on Windows I thought that

153
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,400
I had something up so badly that

154
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,840
nothing was ever going to be the same

155
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,580
again so

156
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,479
um

157
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,720
I actually went into Wall Street and

158
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,400
straight out of college actually during

159
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,860
college by accident so I was going to

160
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,960
school for psychology didn't know what I

161
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,699
wanted to do with my life saw this job

162
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,319
on Fidelity's website that said

163
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,880
financial representative I didn't even

164
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,380
know what a mutual fund was but I

165
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,300
applied for it bullshitted my way

166
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,919
through the interview and somehow I

167
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,600
ended up becoming a stock broker when I

168
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,039
was 20. yeah it was great uh this is

169
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,740
2005. so I kind of cut my teeth in the

170
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,840
run-up to the financial crisis and then

171
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,580
was lucky enough that I had just been

172
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,620
loaned from my team to Fidelity's fixed

173
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,300
income desk today bear stearnsworth

174
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,880
bankruptcy so I got about 10 years worth

175
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
of experience and a really harrowing

176
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,319
couple years in finance then moved over

177
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,880
to Silicon Valley Bank and that's

178
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,160
actually how I met hacker Dojo so svb

179
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,740
heard me explaining municipal bonds to

180
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,720
my husband somebody from SBB in an

181
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,940
airport bar my husband's an engineer so

182
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,620
I was explaining principal bonds as an

183
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,180
engineer way

184
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,680
um and they stopped me and said hey we

185
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,419
need somebody who can do this for CFO

186
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,880
the CEOs and Boards of director and help

187
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
them manage their cash so I started

188
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,900
working at svb and I really kind of

189
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,120
caught the tech bug I was working with

190
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,620
all these great startup companies

191
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,840
actually met hacker dojo and the team

192
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,940
here when just a couple years after

193
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,400
hacker Dojo opened because they held all

194
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,020
these amazing

195
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,080
um meetups and workshops for startup

196
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,280
families

197
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,860
so I decided to leave finance and I

198
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,060
wanted I knew I wanted to get into Tech

199
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,160
but wasn't sure what I wanted to do and

200
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,500
through my whole career the theme that

201
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,440
was recurring to me was that even with

202
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,599
good data if people don't have good

203
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,400
context for the data if they don't

204
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,680
understand how to think about it or how

205
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,940
to compare it to things they're already

206
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,919
familiar with people will make very bad

207
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,319
decisions and I saw that in finance

208
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,860
during the financial crisis I saw that

209
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,180
with the tech companies that I helped

210
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,979
who would literally leave half a billion

211
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,300
dollars sitting in their checking

212
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,440
account

213
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,759
um so

214
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,319
I thought

215
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,599
well if I could do a better job of

216
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,399
understanding and manipulating data then

217
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,719
I could probably understand the world

218
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,399
and I also really wanted to Learn Python

219
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,380
and already understood statistics

220
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,000
um I had gotten an economics and finance

221
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,399
degree by this point so I became a data

222
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,200
scientist I went to the UC Berkeley data

223
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,520
boot camp

224
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,620
um and for My Capstone project I took a

225
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,180
million book cover images from Amazon

226
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,100
and I fed them through image analysis

227
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,959
and then Associated the analysis with

228
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,820
their rating and I created this really

229
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,320
cute model that would literally judge

230
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,300
your book by its cover so if you

231
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,279
uploaded a picture of a book cover it

232
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,200
would say based on your cover alone this

233
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,440
book is likely to be a 3.2 on Amazon

234
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,720
um didn't really think much of it and

235
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,040
actually ended up getting recruited to

236
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,200
an AR company and we won we actually won

237
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,600
TechCrunch disrupt in 2018

238
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,220
um to do AR stuff

239
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,959
and then this guy reached out to me and

240
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,580
he said hey I just got hired as the

241
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,560
first data scientist for this Sim vendor

242
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,000
who's writing

243
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,820
um Sim is a SIM for basically core

244
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,440
banking systems and given your

245
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
background and your project that I saw

246
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,740
um I think I put it in one of my code

247
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,300
repositories

248
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,800
um it's like we would love to interview

249
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,920
you so I was like oh so the highest

250
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,540
level of math I took in high school was

251
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,399
algebra 2. I never thought I was going

252
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,740
into anything statistical so the week

253
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,660
before my data science interview I took

254
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,940
the MIT applied calculus for data

255
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,560
science class

256
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,660
it was a lot

257
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,240
um and apparently I over prepared but I

258
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,339
learned so much and and what I learned

259
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,040
was that sitting through a class

260
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,380
is never really as valuable as getting

261
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,540
your hands on a keyboard is never really

262
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,700
as valuable as applying the concepts and

263
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,100
the principles that you know to actual

264
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,260
problems and so where I had really

265
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,660
struggled with algebra and calculus and

266
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,060
trig before all of a sudden now that I

267
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,620
was applying it to data science at all

268
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,760
made sets

269
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,320
so the beginning of the data scientist

270
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,600
for the Sim vendor and what I did was I

271
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,399
wrote anomaly detection so I wrote These

272
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,019
neural networks that would kind of do

273
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,760
sort of what zero trust is trying to

274
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,260
accomplish right now make these

275
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,899
context-based decisions on not just are

276
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,580
you inside or outside the choir wall or

277
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,320
do you usually access this application

278
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,420
but do you usually access this

279
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,339
application at this time from this

280
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,459
computer so creating more robust kind of

281
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,399
user Behavior Analytics

282
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,740
um and it really kind of

283
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,680
got me back into computers and cyber

284
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,060
security right and I started meeting all

285
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,040
these really cool people

286
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,420
um and so that's how I got into cyber

287
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,519
security they went on to patent a couple

288
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,680
of the anomaly detection and uavas that

289
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,959
I wrote and then um I ended up moving to

290
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,940
s p as an analyst so I covered this

291
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,880
industry for a couple months and then my

292
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
boss who just showed up and brought me

293
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,660
coffee from Starbucks which is can you

294
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,180
really ask for something to do with that

295
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,220
um he happened to brief me on

296
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,560
and as a data scientist one of the

297
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,500
things that I just freaking hate is that

298
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,120
I would spend a week or two with every

299
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,220
new model just trying to get the data

300
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,779
into something I could understand and

301
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,420
use with redbacks and just

302
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,000
all of that and what kerbil did was made

303
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,579
a lot of that obsolete so that's how I

304
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:30,899
ended up where I'm at now and I do

305
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,660
Market strategy so I it turns out I'm a

306
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,459
human translator I I don't know about

307
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,019
having no filter that's probably true

308
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:39,540
but um I can translate from nerd to

309
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,820
Executive from you know customer to

310
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,500
engineering from engineering to customer

311
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,899
and so what I do is kind of understand

312
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,480
the security market and what the market

313
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
really needs and what problems really

314
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,980
need to be solved and then our company

315
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,040
tries to solve them so

316
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,380
oh see

317
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,300
all right so what I wanted to talk about

318
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,560
today

319
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,959
um kind of before I get into the the

320
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,220
technical part of what I'm going to talk

321
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,800
about is coming together so this is the

322
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,260
first time we've been back in person and

323
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,700
um I think we've all attended a bunch of

324
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,959
virtual events over the last couple

325
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,240
years and they're okay but nothing

326
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,640
really beats being in a room with a

327
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,079
bunch of really freaking smart people

328
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,060
and then you add some substances and

329
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,779
things get really fun right so

330
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,060
I think that the reason that hackers are

331
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,620
winning and they're winning like we're

332
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,560
screwed the the state of security is not

333
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,660
free right we have like 80 80 of

334
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,880
companies have had some type of malware

335
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,100
um or uh ransomware incident in the last

336
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,779
12 months most of them are just paying

337
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,720
the ransoms and trying to move on and it

338
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,220
really occurred to me a few months ago

339
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,680
that I was reading I was reading this

340
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,660
thing on the dark web where you can buy

341
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,579
ransomware exploits for five or ten

342
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,820
dollars they are insanely cheap some

343
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,380
people will just put them out there for

344
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,600
free because some men love to watch the

345
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,579
world burn and so

346
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,500
what hackers have done is they've open

347
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,240
sourced everything they're sharing

348
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,040
information they're working as groups

349
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,180
they're not competing they're

350
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,220
collaborating and they've created this

351
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,139
open source playground where people can

352
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,019
do their best work for terrible reasons

353
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,240
security has done the exact opposite

354
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,860
right we've spent the last 30 years

355
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,139
building silos being anti-competitive

356
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,300
creating proprietary languages that are

357
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,060
a to learn and just generally not

358
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,800
doing a great job working well together

359
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,320
most of our security Stacks look like

360
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,120
they're put together with kind of duct

361
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,240
tape and bubble gum and nobody's out

362
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,860
there really trying to solve this

363
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,019
problem of hey we need to work together

364
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,839
so um in the last year I shouldn't say

365
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,339
nobody because in the last couple years

366
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,200
we've actually started to see that tide

367
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,480
shift right so we have this new ocsf

368
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,579
which is this great framework for how we

369
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,139
should be thinking about security data

370
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,420
and formatting it a lot of companies are

371
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,399
moving into the home or multi-cloud you

372
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,839
know we support lots of things so I

373
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:55,860
think we're moving in the right

374
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,380
direction but the people in this room

375
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,320
right now are the key component of

376
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,899
winning this war we are never ever ever

377
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,360
going to accomplish anything if we don't

378
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,600
all advocate for open source advocate

379
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,660
for common protocols advocate for better

380
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,420
sharing of information

381
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,279
 as a company is dedicated we

382
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,200
provide free certification so we have a

383
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,519
couple different levels of certification

384
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,200
and we have already committed as a

385
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,760
company that all of our training and

386
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,160
education will be free forever because

387
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,500
there should not be a barrier to you

388
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,180
learning how to do a job or learning how

389
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,120
to be better at your job so I think we

390
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,620
really need to start thinking about how

391
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,019
we support ourselves as a community

392
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,639
um you know one of the things that I get

393
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,500
asked all the time is you know how do we

394
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,540
get more women into cyber security well

395
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,339
the answer is you can't be in what you

396
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,100
can't see and until we start coming

397
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,120
together more and being more visibly

398
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,820
United as women in cyber security as

399
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,940
non-binary people as the amazing freaky

400
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,500
Geeks that we are which is why I love

401
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,360
working in security

402
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,040
um we're not going to be able to hire

403
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,160
the 5 to 10 million analysts five to ten

404
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,740
million analysts just to solve the

405
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,260
shortfall in the next five years so so

406
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,720
that's my feel about coming together so

407
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,120
really happy that we could all be here

408
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,079
um and now I want to talk about

409
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,540
technical stuff

410
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,279
um all right so the way I think about

411
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,199
kind of the evolution of security and

412
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,699
threats is

413
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,380
in the beginning we had a firewall and

414
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,940
an antivirus right it was like as long

415
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,380
as we keep everybody out of the firewall

416
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,480
we'll be fine and then an antivirus will

417
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,060
solve anything any anything that

418
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,440
somebody clicks we don't want them to

419
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,839
but realistically there was everywhere

420
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,399
and everything was the through and

421
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,040
they're around so we said okay we need a

422
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,399
new mat and we developed a tool upon

423
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,699
tool upon tool upon tool to solve very

424
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:51,060
specific feature type issues and now we

425
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,899
have this insane cluster of

426
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,899
tools but there's still gaps and instead

427
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,880
of missing threats because we can't see

428
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,060
them we now miss them because we have

429
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,459
1500 false positive alerts that need to

430
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,160
be triaged and as an analyst the last

431
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,040
research that I did last year showed

432
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,720
that uh 24 of uh alerts are actually

433
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,459
even being triaged so we're not even

434
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,019
looking at three quarters of the stuff

435
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,760
that our tools are surfacing so the

436
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,860
question is why do we even use them

437
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,480
right if we're not actually going to use

438
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,820
the data that they produce

439
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,860
and then you know the connected world is

440
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,779
a beautiful thing right I I am one of

441
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,300
those people that I I embrace technology

442
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,940
wholeheartedly I love all of my smart

443
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,800
devices everything in my house is

444
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,199
connected but we're talking about 45

445
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,100
billion devices by 2025. and each of

446
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,399
these devices produces logs metrics

447
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,120
Trace all this data

448
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,540
so as you can see over 64 Zeta bytes of

449
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,940
data was created or replicated in 2020

450
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,000
and that's growing at 25 a year so we're

451
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,060
probably a lot closer to over a hundred

452
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,000
Zeta bytes at this point and again we're

453
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,339
not looking at the vast majority of it

454
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,459
so uh I'm a former analyst my boss is a

455
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,319
former analyst so we thought what's the

456
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,640
best way to figure out what the hell

457
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,319
people are doing to try to handle this

458
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,199
and we did a survey so we surveyed like

459
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,119
a thousand Security Professionals see so

460
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,980
the BP from security and we're like what

461
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,419
are you doing like what what are you

462
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,160
what is it what does your environment

463
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,079
look like today how are you addressing

464
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,360
some of these problems

465
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,460
um and I think what's interesting that I

466
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,260
took away from it is that security teams

467
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,700
are actually working really closely with

468
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,620
it teams which has not always been the

469
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,679
case has not always been the most

470
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,480
symbiotic of relationships

471
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,340
um and they're also managing a lot of

472
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,780
tools we'll talk about how many in a

473
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,700
minute but still not really building

474
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,679
sustainable architecture

475
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,160
um this is kind of mind rolling for me

476
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,320
so 63 of the people we surveyed so

477
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,900
roughly 600 of these people said their

478
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,240
strategy was sustainable for three years

479
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
or less and half of those people

480
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,720
actually said their strategy was

481
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,480
sustainable for 12 months or less

482
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,280
but they said that they are very

483
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,679
confident in their strategy so to me

484
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,360
that says that we have started to define

485
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,059
success in how we manage security data

486
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,280
as we're just dealing with it 12 months

487
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,960
at a time if we're lucky if we're lucky

488
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,340
we're dealing with it 12 months at a

489
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,000
time and that is not a great position to

490
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
be in

491
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,900
uh yeah and so it don't those people who

492
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,640
are very competent in their strategy are

493
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,160
using more than 25 tools for visibility

494
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,580
and adding more and I think that is a

495
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,799
very common thing that occurs is that if

496
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,520
there's some type of snafu instead of

497
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,820
RCA and fixing the root cause of the

498
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,200
problem we buy a tool because we're like

499
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,960
well clearly our Sims screwed up or our

500
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,660
store screwed up or it's our EDR not

501
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,640
it's probably the way we're managing

502
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,100
security as a whole and so retail

503
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,720
therapy is

504
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,380
alive and strong insecurity

505
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,020
this one I so

506
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,299
coming into this survey I I was telling

507
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,539
my team my team security just doesn't

508
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,700
mean and so this company started as an

509
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,200
observability company and I said well

510
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,120
observability is kind of an I.T term and

511
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,799
we don't really play with it that well

512
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,179
we don't want them in our budgets we

513
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,860
don't want them in our buying processes

514
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,400
and so we did this survey and it turns

515
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,419
out I'm wrong

516
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,039
um and whether this is because new

517
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,480
people are coming into the market that

518
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,919
don't have these kind of pre-existing

519
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,860
dysfunctional relationship ideas or I

520
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,720
was just wrong all along

521
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,360
um 92 90 plus percent of people say that

522
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,500
they actually work really well they're

523
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,200
like closely with it and we've always

524
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,020
said all data is security data and it

525
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,400
sounds like we're starting to kind of

526
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
agree

527
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,100
pretty good

528
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,360
so

529
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,059
I I kind of identified three real areas

530
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,480
that are causing people to um not be as

531
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,160
efficient and productive with their

532
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,559
security data as we want them to be the

533
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,059
first is a lot of people have data they

534
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:05,700
just can't see so I know you guys are

535
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,620
all on point with all of your naming

536
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,539
conventions you have documented

537
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,760
processes at your company so no one ever

538
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,500
names something that they shouldn't all

539
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,960
usernames are the same I hate to break

540
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,460
this to you but some people don't do

541
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,580
that and when you try to do incident

542
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,380
response and you're trying to figure out

543
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,900
how many different things this account

544
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,020
has touched if you don't have a great

545
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,260
way to access all of the different ways

546
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,480
that this user has identified you're

547
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,380
going to have a really hard time

548
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,500
Gathering the information that you need

549
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,020
and then even if you can gather it a lot

550
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,760
of us can't afford it

551
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,260
so

552
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,380
I met with a university two weeks ago

553
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,120
and they told me they weren't capturing

554
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,980
their web requests at all

555
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,020
and the guy was like I know that's

556
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,640
terrible it's literally our single

557
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,620
biggest attack service students are the

558
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,799
problem and but there's so so of

559
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,020
voluminous same thing with network flows

560
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,480
right like this is where attacks show up

561
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,980
I always say to people like if you

562
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,600
robbed a bank you wouldn't go run into

563
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,580
an empty building to hide you run into a

564
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,500
crowded room so when we think about okay

565
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,480
as an attacker what are the logs that

566
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,220
are the easiest to cover my tracks in

567
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,220
they're really noisy ones right so web

568
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,679
um web requests Network flows DNS

569
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,600
request and response that's a big one

570
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,760
right and it's a really kind of

571
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
uh

572
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,240
bulky walk

573
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,120
um so a lot of companies what would so

574
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,280
on the observability side of things we

575
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,140
originally had like a return on

576
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,539
investment value so hey if you spend

577
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,039
money we actually save you money on the

578
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,600
data you're ingesting it turns out in

579
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,700
security we don't actually want to save

580
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,780
money because none of us want our

581
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,059
budgets cut what we want is to get more

582
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:47,520
data in and so what we're finding is

583
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,159
that when people reduce the crap in the

584
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,659
data they're bringing in and reduce the

585
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,400
size the size of the files that they're

586
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,260
looking at they don't actually just

587
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,000
spend less on their Sim it's ingesting

588
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,799
them they onboard all of these data

589
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,000
sources that they really should have

590
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,440
been looking at and weren't as they

591
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,100
couldn't afford to

592
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,620
and so raise your hand if you love regex

593
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,200
all right from now on instead of

594
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,940
relearning how to write regex every time

595
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,159
I need to I'm calling you

596
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,220
um so I met with a customer the other

597
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,320
day who literally had all these heavy

598
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,120
forwarders that he was doing these

599
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,340
insane regex things in to try to handle

600
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,380
his data in but not until it hit the

601
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,940
cloud right so we're talking about

602
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,679
you're paying to ingest the data

603
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,539
then doing a bunch of regex and paying

604
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:36,179
to do that just to get a reduced amount

605
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,700
of data and the thing is is that when

606
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,980
you handle things in line not only do

607
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,620
Upstream changes break Downstream inline

608
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,200
code the other thing is that this bloat

609
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,360
so as a data scientist I didn't think

610
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,340
about like oh it's three extra lines of

611
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,200
code because it's just three extra lines

612
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,240
of code but when that three extra lines

613
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,539
of code is running every time a vlog

614
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,340
that produces 10 million logs a day

615
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,740
comes in that's not three extra lines of

616
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,720
code that's 30 million extra lines of

617
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,240
code and one of the things I think is

618
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,740
interesting is we were kind of told like

619
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,120
the cloud is going to solve all of our

620
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,380
problems right you don't have to buy

621
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,600
more servers you don't have to endlessly

622
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,120
scalable it's wonderful that's totally

623
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,159
true in some ways

624
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,260
um the thing with the cloud is that it's

625
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,179
completely removed us from the actual

626
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,220
impact of our actions so when I was a

627
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,539
new data scientist I was looking at

628
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,640
syslog and I needed to train a neural

629
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,500
network and I hit a button I was like

630
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,720
this is going to take forever so I went

631
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,340
to lunch I came back 75 000 AWS Bill and

632
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,380
luckily Amazon was cool about it and

633
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,360
they refunded the money but I basically

634
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,460
had just not limited the amount of logs

635
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,320
I was pulling and pulled millions of

636
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,039
logs into this neural network and just

637
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,799
um and so there are a lot of issues with

638
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,600
the way we currently handle noisy data

639
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,000
not only is it inefficient but it also

640
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,679
costs us a lot of money that we don't

641
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,080
necessarily see and I can't wait till we

642
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,679
get to a point that we can actually tell

643
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,740
you before you do something

644
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,240
um that we're kind of running off the

645
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,380
rail so

646
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,360
here's the last thing so data that we

647
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,120
can't use so like I said you can give

648
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,299
people as much data as you want but if

649
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,580
you don't give them context or help them

650
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,260
understand what they're looking at they

651
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,840
will make very bad decisions so if

652
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,700
you're just collecting IPS and you're

653
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,620
not doing any type of data enrichment

654
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,600
you're not collecting geolocation you're

655
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,059
not uh counting how many times this IP

656
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,400
has shown up

657
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,320
what's the point and incidentally one of

658
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,900
these IEPs is actually from North Korea

659
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,880
I think

660
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,100
the other thing is that this log says

661
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,640
it's from October 22nd 2020. it may be

662
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,200
but it's probably more likely that

663
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,360
somebody up a timestamp and I

664
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,039
know none of you have misconfigured

665
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,120
timestamps on any of your endpoints

666
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,159
firewalls anything like that but one not

667
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,159
only are so most time stamps are you are

668
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,840
done really inefficiently so firewall

669
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,600
logs is a great example um some I'm not

670
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,039
going to name names some companies

671
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,659
firewall logs have like three or four

672
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,820
time stamps in the header and so we find

673
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,020
with those companies we can literally

674
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,880
just drop the header standardize the

675
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,919
timestamp and reduce like a third of

676
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,220
that long size so these are things that

677
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,380
are not only best practices but they

678
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,020
actually help you do your job much more

679
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,280
efficiently

680
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,080
and so how do you do all this right like

681
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,000
this this is all great in theory but how

682
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,679
do you actually accomplish it

683
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,059
um so what built was called a

684
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,400
security data Pipeline and essentially

685
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,860
the concept here is separate the system

686
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,299
that

687
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,419
analyzes your data from the system that

688
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,760
collects and retains it there's a lot of

689
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,200
reasons that you want to do this but

690
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,820
this one is my favorite

691
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,159
I love Lucky Charms

692
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,440
but I actually don't really like cereal

693
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,080
uh

694
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,700
so what you can do with a data pipeline

695
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,919
is say you know I am a bit of a

696
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,860
sugarholic I really don't like cereal

697
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,020
so what I want to do is I want to take

698
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,700
my lucky charms and I really just want

699
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,039
the marshmallows but my family kind of

700
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,840
likes Lucky Charms so it's possible that

701
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,880
I want to keep the box somewhere but I

702
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,080
don't want to just keep a bunch of

703
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,880
marshmallows somewhere because they're

704
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,620
going to go bad right so I'm going to

705
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,940
take the marshmallows that once you pull

706
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,559
them out of the cereal kind of dry up

707
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:17,820
and get gross I don't know if you've

708
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,559
ever experienced that or they get

709
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,419
boys

710
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:22,100
um

711
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,779
and the time sensitive marshmallows I'm

712
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,039
going to throw that through my Analytics

713
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,260
tool in my mouth the rest of it you

714
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,120
could stick in object storage so the

715
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,159
equivalent of how we handle data right

716
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,080
now is like if every time you've flushed

717
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,940
your toilet your shower and sink turned

718
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,039
on like that's kind of what we do with

719
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,140
logs we put everything through the Sim

720
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,539
or not at all for the most part and so

721
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,340
what we're saying is if you really only

722
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,740
need marshmallows why have the extra

723
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,840
calories of eating with cereal or if you

724
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,120
can eat twice as many marshmallows

725
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,520
and then but you're like okay that's

726
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,340
great but what happens if I didn't pick

727
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,840
the marshmallows out of this certain

728
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,880
type of cereal that I needed so what's

729
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,039
great is with a data replay you can go

730
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,380
back into your data Lake take that data

731
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,360
back out and then send it through your

732
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,179
Analytics tool be it cortex block uh

733
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:10,679
crowdstrick wherever you're sending that

734
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,480
data and actually do all of that

735
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,159
hardcore analysis to it if you really

736
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,720
need to so if we're doing incident

737
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,940
response if we're trying to re and we

738
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,220
can replay full session packet capture

739
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,140
so you can literally watch the packet

740
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,900
capture in real time as if the session

741
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,940
was going on right now so you don't ever

742
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,919
lose access to that data you're just not

743
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,779
paying through the freaking nodes put it

744
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,640
in your Sims

745
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,559
so this is kind of what security looked

746
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,000
like right now we had all of these

747
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,039
sources of data each with their own

748
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,559
agent sitting on an endpoint and almost

749
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,480
all of these agents send data to one

750
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,320
place

751
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,419
so it's kind of the equivalent of every

752
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,080
single I use water as a analogy for data

753
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,880
because I think it's really kind of

754
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,500
similar so it's kind of the equivalent

755
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,559
if every single sink and toilet and

756
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,940
shower in your house had its own

757
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,679
individual pipe coming off the street

758
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,480
it's just it doesn't make sense that it

759
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,000
doesn't really work that well right so

760
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,059
what we've proposed is why not take all

761
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,340
of those sources of data and either use

762
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,380
our Universal agent which can replace

763
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,539
many agents and actually approve

764
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,460
endpoint Performance by not running 15

765
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,860
agents on the same endpoint

766
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,200
um or use the agents that you have but

767
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,840
send this data to one place process it

768
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,940
clean it up reduce it figure out what

769
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,100
pieces of it need to go which places and

770
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,320
only send those pieces to those places

771
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,020
so when you talk about something like a

772
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,820
DNS requests and responses where it's

773
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,260
like a 200 line log and you're

774
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,600
interested in 30 lines if you need to

775
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,400
retain that 200 line log because you're

776
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,320
a government agency you are highly

777
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,539
regulated whatever the case may be you

778
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,159
can just stick that whole thing into a

779
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,679
data Lake and only pay to put the good

780
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,360
stuff through the tools that actually do

781
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,500
what you want to

782
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:54,360
and this is my this is my other soapbox

783
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,480
moment about why this is important so I

784
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,100
am not just cranky and it's not just

785
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,480
that I like my python written

786
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,039
efficiently

787
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,260
um the clouds surpassed the airline

788
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,039
industry for carbon emissions in 2020.

789
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,919
a building at a data center campus uses

790
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,799
as much electricity as 50 000 homes in

791
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,720
the average modern data center campus

792
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,820
has eight to twelve buildings so we're

793
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,799
talking about using half a million homes

794
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,659
worth of electricity per data center

795
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,220
campus

796
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,679
and we are building data centers at an

797
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,000
insane clip

798
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,460
one of the things that has happened uh

799
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,320
with AI and machine learning is that we

800
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,360
used to build data centers to store data

801
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,820
and to do basic computation and we are

802
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,799
now building some data centers almost

803
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,080
exclusively for AI and ML and that's

804
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,320
great I guess if it's being used for the

805
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,240
right reasons but we really need to be

806
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,279
more conscious of the impacts of our

807
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,500
actions with data and computational

808
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,200
power every single Hertz of

809
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,120
computational power

810
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,580
has an effect on the environment and

811
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,980
because we've had to start um there

812
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,240
there's all these interesting kind of

813
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,980
backing and forth whipsaw effects right

814
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,140
so gdpr was seen as this great solution

815
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,720
for privacy what has happened with a lot

816
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,399
of these privacy regulations is they are

817
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,500
now forcing data centers to be built in

818
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,419
climates that are not meant for data

819
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,700
centers data centers are meant to run in

820
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,860
somewhat cool very dry environments

821
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,480
because they actually use water for most

822
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,159
of their cooling we're now having to

823
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,539
build data centers in places like

824
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:24,299
Singapore Singapore is very hot it's

825
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,880
very humid and also you can't build out

826
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,679
so we're having to build vertical data

827
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,720
centers now vertical data centers if you

828
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,460
can imagine the amount of heat that a

829
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,140
regular data center produces the top

830
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,880
floor of a vertical data center is going

831
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,179
to be that times about 20. so we are now

832
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:40,980
building less efficient data centers

833
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,500
we're building more of them and we are

834
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,419
just throwing Ai and machine learning at

835
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:46,980
every problem that looks like it might

836
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,799
be a good fit so

837
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:53,220
my my big plea to you is using

838
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,200
or any other data pipeline there are

839
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,840
others that exist but mostly DIY kind of

840
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,799
solutions

841
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,600
um is also really good for the

842
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,799
environment and that's really important

843
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,158
too much

844
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,020
all right I am done I'm happy to take

845
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,940
questions I only swore a couple times

846
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,140
which is

847
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,380
uh uh kind of accomplishment for me this

848
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,539
is a link to the full security report so

849
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,120
if you want to read all of our

850
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,720
um

851
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,000
research and all of the it was about 25

852
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,380
questions I think

853
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,899
um you could access the full report and

854
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:27,059
take a look at how people are managing

855
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,799
their security data but otherwise I'm

856
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,539
happy to take questions and if nobody

857
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:33,360
has questions I am happy to walk off

858
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,719
with them

859
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,520
yes I will share this presentation

860
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,700
foreign

861
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,799
so I think what's happened is that

862
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,299
um there's a little bit of economic

863
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:03,179
necessity to it right so what

864
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,380
has found that is that typically if

865
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,059
people start using us for observability

866
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,640
on the I.T side they end up using us for

867
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,260
security

868
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,059
um and I think that's the case a lot of

869
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,799
tools that kind of span if you think

870
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,440
about the span kind of it and security

871
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,840
so I think what's happened is it used to

872
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,000
be that security because security didn't

873
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,279
look at all Enterprise data as security

874
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,740
data there was security data that they

875
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,080
control they had you know in warehouses

876
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,179
or data lakes or databases and then

877
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,740
there was I.T data and they were very

878
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,960
much from and again this is my like

879
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,419
probably early 2000s Viewpoint of things

880
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,460
but they were very much segregated and I

881
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,440
think now both because all Enterprise

882
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,419
data is really security data because

883
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,580
hackers are smart right we all were like

884
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,720
all right they're not looking at this

885
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,179
I'm just going to go there and do that

886
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:50,520
um so I think that and then economically

887
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,559
we can't afford to have three different

888
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,299
tools looking at the same same data

889
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,220
because security wants their own tool

890
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,500
and it wants their own tool and network

891
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,240
Ops wants their own tools so I think

892
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,640
some of it is is kind of economically

893
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,500
driven at this point but I also think

894
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,779
it's just the nature of understanding

895
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:10,940
that all data is security data

896
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,179
triage yeah

897
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,539
and so I heard like a few years ago

898
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,240
about the

899
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,200
actors

900
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,120
so I was wondering if yours

901
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,419
um so I don't have one on um accuracy of

902
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:48,000
alerts but that's so kind of coming from

903
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,260
data science where I wrote the things

904
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,419
that do these detections that's really

905
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,039
what we're trying to address with the

906
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,019
data pipeline right so the one of the

907
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,820
reasons that you produce a lot of false

908
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,120
alerts is that when you feed

909
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,880
um non-pertinent data to a model so for

910
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,059
example if you feed machine ID or like

911
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,040
anything else that has a variation but

912
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,500
doesn't actually the variation isn't a

913
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,239
feature of the model meaning it's not an

914
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,879
indication you get false positives and

915
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,099
so machine learning is still kind of

916
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,399
this

917
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,139
spongeable thing that we're we're trying

918
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,179
to throw at every problem to see if it

919
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,500
can tackle

920
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,599
um and so the whole point of feeding

921
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,960
better feeding just marshmallows to your

922
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,179
sim is that it won't freak out if one of

923
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,679
the lucky charm ethereal is the wrong

924
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,139
shape or color right so that's kind of

925
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,659
the whole point of boosting signal to

926
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,639
noise is to get more accurate alerts

927
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,918
because you're absolutely right bad and

928
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,899
noisy data causes a lot of false

929
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,060
positives but it also causes false

930
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,080
negatives

931
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,060
um and you lose you lose legitimate

932
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,580
threats to the the model not

933
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,879
understanding them so um but I I was an

934
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,500
analyst for s p Market intelligence and

935
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,540
we did a

936
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,880
survey very to address what you're

937
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,800
talking about so I can see if I can find

938
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,960
that for you but it's not it's not our

939
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,200
stuff

940
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,200
I think I might have done way over time

941
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,000
so thank you guys

942
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,359
um please

943
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,640
several security positions open

944
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,380
kerbil.io jobs

945
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,820
um if you just if you see something you

946
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,920
like please feel free to come see me

947
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,720
right now feel free to hit me up on

948
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,400
social media or email me

949
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,839
um we're growing really fast doing

950
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,520
really well and would love more smart

951
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,920
people on board thanks guys thank you

952
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,900
thank you

953
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,400
all right that was pretty awesome thank

954
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,020
you very much Jackie

955
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,079
um
