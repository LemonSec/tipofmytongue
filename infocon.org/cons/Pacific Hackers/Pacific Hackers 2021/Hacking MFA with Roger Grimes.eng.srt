00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,000
computer security for 34

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,920
years i earned all these gray hairs um

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,520
i've done a lot of things in life

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,920
including i've written 12 books and over

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,320
now

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
1100 magazine articles on computer

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,439
security

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,320
i've been everything from a pc repair

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,280
technician

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,920
network uh network manager vp of it

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,440
probably my favorite job was being a

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,760
penetration tester i love being a hacker

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,680
that's my favorite job of all

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
um i've been a penetration tester every

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,879
20 years

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,200
every place i was hired to hack into i

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,160
broke into an

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,879
hour or less except for one place uh

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,480
that took me three to five hours because

63
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,319
it was the second time i was there

64
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,920
but on a scale of one to ten i'm

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,680
actually not that great of a hacker i'm

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,239
average

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
i'm a five the six you know tens of

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,760
being the greatest

69
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,000
you know i'm okay but i'm not great but

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,200
i'm really good at

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
defending against hacking that's kind of

72
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,319
my specialty

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,000
there are some of my books the talk

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
today hacking mfa

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
it actually when i started giving this

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,720
talk

77
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,519
um it was because kevin mitnick he's the

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,800
chief acting officer

79
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,680
at my company know before uh he's also

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,080
this

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,360
uh probably one of the most infamous

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,400
hackers in the world

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,319
back in the 80s he was a mischievous

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,800
hacker and freaker and doing phone

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,480
freaking and stuff like that

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,239
and he got caught and arrested in the

87
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,239
late 1980s spent a couple of years in

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:08,720
jail

89
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,560
came out and he's been uh he's been a

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,159
good guy ever since and i was very

91
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,280
dubious of that

92
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,040
fact people back in the day were like

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
saying free kevin free kevin i was like

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,200
no put his ass in jail

95
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
uh because i'm not for i i'm not for

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,200
illegal hacking

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,680
uh but he he actually is a good guy he

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,879
uh turned you know he

99
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,239
realized that he could make a better

100
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
living uh being a

101
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,120
penetration tester and white hat hacker

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,519
and

103
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,040
he always says he gets the same thrill

104
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
hacking as a white hat hacker as he did

105
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,920
when he was a

106
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
a a malicious hacker he said except for

107
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,440
there's more paperwork

108
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,480
now but when i was at no before early on

109
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
kevin demonstrated a a way to hack mfa

110
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,040
that i'm going to show you in about 10

111
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,920
minutes

112
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,040
and when that was shown we literally got

113
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
like a thousand

114
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,959
media inquiries that wanted to know all

115
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,360
about it how it was done

116
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,599
and they asked me kevin couldn't answer

117
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,120
all the questions could i pick them up

118
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
well i've been hacking mfa

119
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,319
at that time for 25 30 years i've been

120
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,879
on

121
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,319
dozens of projects mfa projects dozens

122
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,000
of hacking mfa projects

123
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
i've hacked just about every type of mfa

124
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,600
there is and um

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
so i was glad to answer those questions

126
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,199
but i was shocked that so many people

127
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,360
were surprised that you could hack mfa

128
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,280
because nfa has been hacked since the

129
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
day mfa was released

130
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
and if the entire world went to mfa it

131
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,639
wouldn't stop

132
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,080
packers and malware i mean because

133
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,520
they've been getting around they've been

134
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,479
hacking around

135
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,240
uh mfa for decades so i ended up writing

136
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
i did a webinar and in my 34 career my

137
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,040
this webinar i'm showing you right now

138
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,120
today is that webinar

139
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
it is the most popular webinar i've ever

140
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
taught in my 30 plus years

141
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
i thought of the black cat i told it at

142
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,960
rsa um

143
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,199
and it was the standing room only crowds

144
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
people waiting out in the hallway

145
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,199
i wrote a white paper then an e-book and

146
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,039
then wiley who i've done a lot of books

147
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,560
with said hey would you write a book on

148
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,639
and i did and the book has like 50 plus

149
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,039
ways to hack mfa

150
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,720
i work for know before right now we're

151
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,240
the world's largest security awareness

152
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,960
training

153
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,360
uh vendor so you know we help companies

154
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
teach their employees how not to get

155
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,160
phished or socially engineered but

156
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
you know again this whole thing's about

157
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,759
mfa or as much as i can cover i'll

158
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,680
probably cover somewhere between 12 to

159
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
18 ways to hack mfa over the next hour

160
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,759
and the to kind of get into what you

161
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,440
know multi-factor authentication is

162
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,120
you're authenticating you have these

163
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,639
different types of authentication

164
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,680
factors

165
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,240
they're traditionally known as three

166
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
something you know something you have

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,120
something you are something you know is

168
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
like your password or your pen

169
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,479
or maybe you're connecting dots on a

170
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,320
screen to log in somewhere

171
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
something you have that would be like a

172
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,919
usb token smart card

173
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,080
something like that something you are

174
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,000
typically is biometrics and those

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,919
biometrics can be different fingerprints

176
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,440
are probably the most common one

177
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,160
probably hand print geometry the logging

178
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
into time clocks is pretty popular

179
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
retina scans are

180
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,039
up there uh i even once was on a us army

181
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,759
project

182
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,440
this is probably in the 90s i'm trying

183
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,039
to identify people by the way they

184
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,160
smelled

185
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,400
and it was interesting we could identify

186
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,840
different people based upon how they

187
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
smelled but then we found if they drank

188
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,160
alcohol or ate garlic and overrode the

189
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,039
sensors

190
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,880
you know everybody that uh drinks and

191
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
eats garlic apparently smells a lot of

192
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,800
light so that didn't work out as being

193
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
super accurate

194
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,319
uh but i've been around mfa for decades

195
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,840
i've been hacking mfa

196
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,639
and you know for a long time but besides

197
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,080
those three factors today there's

198
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,680
traditional three factors there's other

199
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,759
factors we have today called contextual

200
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,400
behavioral or your location like you

201
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,479
know are you logging in from a device

202
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,319
that's previously been logged in before

203
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,240
is it a device that you registered are

204
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,680
you coming from a place that you

205
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,160
normally

206
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,039
log in from are you doing the things you

207
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,360
normally do or even behavioral analytics

208
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,319
there's a whole

209
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,319
kind of biometrics field called

210
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,919
keystroke dynamics

211
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,160
that can act it actually measures how

212
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,680
long it takes you to put in your

213
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,000
password and it measures each keystroke

214
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
each downstroke and upstroke

215
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,560
and together they can fairly accurately

216
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,280
determine

217
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,080
is it you typing in your password or not

218
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,479
um

219
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,520
matter of fact when i worked at

220
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,160
microsoft for hotmail

221
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,240
and um whatever they're calling it these

222
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,560
days uh we had over a hundred

223
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
factors that we looked at why someone

224
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
was logging in to determine whether or

225
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
not they were the person they said they

226
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,840
were you know were they coming in with

227
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
the same browser

228
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,440
or the same combination of browser and

229
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,599
you know operating system and things

230
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,759
like that if somebody tried to log in

231
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,639
uh from let's say texas an hour later

232
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,160
they're logging in from china

233
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,280
and that's probably unlikely so

234
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
you can really have lots of different

235
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
factors out there there's three you know

236
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,520
there's

237
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
there's one factor two factor three

238
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,479
factor but really you'll hear about

239
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:52,879
seven

240
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,520
factor solutions and things like that uh

241
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,280
so single factor is like

242
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,199
you know that's traditionally like a

243
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,039
login name and password or the password

244
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,800
is the secret you type in

245
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,720
but it could be like a lot of fido keys

246
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
you just plug them into the usb slot and

247
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,360
their

248
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,000
single factor meaning that all having

249
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,759
possession of the fido key is enough to

250
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,000
have

251
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
your identity sometimes maybe they make

252
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,919
you push a button and they call that two

253
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,680
factor but i still think that's kind of

254
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,039
one factor

255
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,400
but you can you know so you have two

256
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
factor multi-factor multi-factor could

257
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,479
be

258
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
two-factor or more and again many times

259
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,080
you hear about these five

260
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
and seven factors usually it's just that

261
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,599
they're

262
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,000
they're using contextual behavioral

263
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,839
things in it like your device is a

264
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,559
factor

265
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
what device you're already coming from

266
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,320
the same cell phone the same laptop

267
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,360
um and you know when you have all these

268
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
different factors the idea is that as

269
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,519
you have more factors you want them

270
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,200
to be different factors you know you

271
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
don't want it to be two of the same

272
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
factor you don't want to be two things

273
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
you know like if they're like put in the

274
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,320
password and put it a pen well those are

275
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,279
two things that a

276
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,920
a fishing person you know a scammer

277
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,440
could trick you out of but

278
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
if you have to provide a pen or a

279
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,519
password and a dongle or a

280
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,080
fido key you know it's tougher for the

281
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
attacker to learn both or get

282
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,399
access to both so all things considered

283
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,120
equal

284
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,640
you want to have different types of

285
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
factors when you're doing multi-factor

286
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,080
authentication

287
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,519
also i'm going to show you a lot of ways

288
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
you can hack mfa but just know that

289
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,519
mfa is a good thing and we all should

290
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,160
try to use mfa when we can

291
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,720
um even though it's easy to hack and

292
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,440
easy to

293
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,680
get around in a lot of cases we should

294
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,200
strive to use it where we can

295
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,399
unfortunately mfa doesn't work well that

296
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,080
kind of

297
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,839
went out here let's see what happened do

298
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,880
y'all still see my screen

299
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,880
no no no it got unshared for some reason

300
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,240
let me see what's going on

301
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,680
i did something wrong computers will

302
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,240
drive you nuts

303
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,440
here we go again um but mfa

304
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,080
doesn't work with uh even two percent of

305
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,000
the world's websites and services so

306
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
we're probably all for the next five or

307
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,040
ten years

308
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,200
gonna have a have to have a combination

309
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,399
of passwords and mfa and i don't know if

310
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,200
you're like me i

311
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
i have to use multiple mfas most of us

312
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,360
probably do

313
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,279
you may have one for work you may have

314
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,399
one for your bank

315
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,839
you may have another one when you go to

316
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,360
some other website but that that's kind

317
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
of the reality of today is that we have

318
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,760
we're all have a combination of

319
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,800
passwords and

320
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,920
multiple you know multiple mfa's but

321
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,079
mfa is a good thing so some people have

322
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,000
to see this talk like i'm never using

323
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
mfa it's too easy to hack

324
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,839
it's a good thing and it typically mfa

325
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,519
significantly decreases some forms of

326
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,120
hacking and for that alone it should be

327
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
used it just isn't

328
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
unhackable and i've met a lot of people

329
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,279
that when they use mfa they think like

330
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:49,920
that's

331
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
you know i'm a lot harder to hack but in

332
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,600
90 of the cases i can send you a

333
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
phishing email and if i get you to click

334
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,279
on the link i can get around your mfa

335
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,120
and i'll show you one of those ways in

336
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,640
just a minute so that's really what i'm

337
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,839
trying to teach here

338
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
is that any everything's hackable and

339
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,560
mfa isn't any different

340
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,079
although to understand how you can do

341
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,600
some of the hacking you know there's

342
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,959
three at least three different

343
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,640
components of authentication you have

344
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,760
your identity

345
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,160
or your identifier which is you know you

346
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
like your login id so it could be

347
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
it could be a net bias name it could be

348
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,519
your windows login

349
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,240
it could be an ldap login it could be

350
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,720
your email address it could be a dns

351
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,399
address it could be

352
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,800
the public it could be your digital

353
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,839
certificate

354
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,560
uh but in any authentication system it

355
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,640
has to have some type of name space

356
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,680
ldap dns uh you know

357
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,000
active directory and then you your

358
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,399
account has to be linked to a unique

359
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,120
identity

360
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,360
within that name space you can't have

361
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,519
the same no two people can have the same

362
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,480
login name

363
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,079
let's say like within the same active

364
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,760
directory forest

365
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,399
um and then you so you type in or

366
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
somehow provide your identity

367
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,240
and then you have to prove that you have

368
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,399
ownership of that identity by providing

369
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,120
one or more

370
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,040
factors of authentication and if you

371
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
successfully provide those then you get

372
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,240
authenticated

373
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,760
and then almost always you're going to

374
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,079
be given an access control token which

375
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,519
is kind of a license that says this

376
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,920
person has successfully authenticated

377
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,800
and then behind the scenes whenever your

378
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
identity goes to access something

379
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
instead of having to relog into that

380
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,279
system

381
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,519
it uses this access control token that

382
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,680
access control token has your identity

383
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
in it may have

384
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
in windows right your access control

385
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,000
token has like your

386
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,399
your groups and your and your privileges

387
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,519
and things like that

388
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,200
and then when you go to access a

389
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
protected object

390
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
that uh that access control token is

391
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,959
evaluated by the security

392
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,519
manager to see are you allowed to access

393
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,360
this protected resource and if you are

394
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,079
with what

395
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,880
permissions or privileges on a website

396
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
you'll typically that access control

397
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
token is almost always a cookie

398
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,399
it's just a text based cookie that's put

399
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,839
into your browser

400
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,600
that has some type of identity

401
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
identifier global unique identity

402
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
identifier that's tracked to your

403
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,480
account

404
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
but this is an important point if i've

405
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,360
lost you if you're going to sleep

406
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,079
already

407
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,279
uh pay attention here because 99 of

408
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,240
it security people don't know this small

409
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,120
point

410
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,600
and that is no matter how you log on in

411
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,959
whether it's

412
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,639
username and password smart card

413
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
phyto key fingerprint scanner

414
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,240
the access control token that you get

415
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,240
after you successfully log on in

416
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560
looks the same for everyone you know i

417
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,000
don't know what i thought years ago i

418
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
thought years ago like if i used the

419
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
fingerprint scanner before i understood

420
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,320
this concept i think i thought my

421
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,000
fingerprint was somehow being sent

422
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,199
around the network and when i was

423
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,880
logging into a database or opening a

424
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
document somehow

425
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
you know active directory was you know

426
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
trying was using my fingerprint like oh

427
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,000
yeah that's roger's fingerprint but

428
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,279
that's not what happens

429
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,720
uh you know if you log in with a

430
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,800
fingerprint or a password let's say in

431
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
your laptop

432
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,279
you then get a kerberos ticket or token

433
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,720
or ntln token

434
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,639
and it looks identical whether or not

435
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,160
you logged in with a username and

436
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,040
password or you used a fingerprint or a

437
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,399
smart card or a phyto key

438
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,399
the access control token that you're

439
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,199
given like when you log into a website

440
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,120
no matter how you log into that website

441
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
you get a text-based cookie after you're

442
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,600
through

443
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,839
and if an attacker can grab that access

444
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,959
control token

445
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,440
they can steal your identity for that

446
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
session or for that software for that

447
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
network

448
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,079
and one of the most common ways this is

449
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,760
done is something called network session

450
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,839
hijacking it's been around for decades

451
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,680
and decades the first time i saw it

452
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,480
occur

453
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,959
was in the late 1980s i first wrote

454
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,760
about it in 1989 i wrote a lot about it

455
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
in 1991.

456
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,040
millions of people have been hacked

457
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,199
because of network session hijacking and

458
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:47,920
essentially

459
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,040
what goes on with this is again the

460
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,680
hacker has to trick the victim into some

461
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
sort of man-in-the-middle attack

462
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,519
where the attacker can see everything

463
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
that's sent between the client to the

464
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,839
server and

465
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,839
everything from the server to the client

466
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,040
so they typically trick

467
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,600
the victim to going to a man in the

468
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,160
middle website proxy website

469
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
and then no matter how the victim logs

470
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,600
on in whether it's password or

471
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,639
two-factor

472
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,959
the attacker just waits for the access

473
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,040
control token to be granted by the

474
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,920
server

475
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,320
the attacker steals that token and then

476
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
takes over the session and that's what

477
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,360
i'm going to show you in

478
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,680
in just a minute but again this is the

479
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,279
most common way that it's done

480
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,759
it's been done for decades is that a bad

481
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,680
guy's got to convince a victim to visit

482
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,079
a rogue website of some sort

483
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,680
they prompt the victim to put in their

484
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
credentials mfa or otherwise

485
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,079
the victim puts it in the bad guys

486
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,199
software actually

487
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,600
is capturing all that and proxies it to

488
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,480
the server

489
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,000
and anything the server wants like if

490
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
the server's like you need to put in

491
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
your mfa credentials it proxies that

492
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,839
back

493
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,560
to the user the user doesn't know that

494
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,000
it's occurring the server doesn't know

495
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
that it's occurring

496
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,759
uh but then finally when the victim logs

497
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,079
on in successfully the server sends the

498
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,680
access control token

499
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,839
the attacker steals that token takes

500
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,720
over that session

501
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,560
usually changes the password and kicks

502
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,639
the the real victim out

503
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
so i'm going to get ready to show you a

504
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,759
video uh

505
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,440
that kevin this is the the video that

506
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
kevin mendy did a couple years ago

507
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,120
that made so many so many people were

508
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,560
shocked shocked they couldn't believe

509
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,920
how easy it was

510
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,079
and they wanted to know if uh it was on

511
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,040
linkedin

512
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,720
whether uh microsoft and lincoln were

513
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
gonna fix it and they were all upset

514
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,279
when i told them no

515
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,800
they weren't gonna fix it we're gonna be

516
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,399
able to fix it because it's just not the

517
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,120
way

518
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
that sort of uh mfa worked there's no it

519
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,720
wasn't a bug

520
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,000
it's just a way that you can get around

521
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,480
that type of mfa and there was no bug to

522
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,440
fix it was

523
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,959
as designed so i'm going to show you

524
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,519

531
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,199

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
sure this

533
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,119
okay and then i should be able to play

let me know if you can see this video in

535
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,840
here kevin talking officer

536
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,280
it appears to be an email and ordinarily

537
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,960
when somebody wants to

538
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,360
join your network on linkedin linkedin

539
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,480
will actually send an

540
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,320
email to your email address notification

541
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,919
if you're interested you can go ahead

542
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,400
and click interesting log into your

543
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,039
linkedin account and authorize that

544
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:03,840
person

545
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
to actually become a connection so we

546
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,760
take a look here we have an email from

547
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,840
there that says kevin i've read about

548
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,679
your adventures and goes to the wires

549
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,640
and so on

550
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,120
and this person wants to join my network

551
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,919
but this is

552
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,039
actually a phishing attack if we take a

553
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,080
look here

554
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,720
at where the email is originating from

555
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,280
it's not

556
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,480
at linkedin.com except this domain

557
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,200
called lln which people might overlook

558
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
so let's go ahead and pretend that we're

559
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,320
the victim here

560
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,960
and go ahead and click on interested and

561
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,520
what that

562
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,559
is going to do it's going to redirect us

563
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,799
to the to your website to go ahead and

564
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,000
log in

565
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,840
but let's move this over right

566
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,000
but that load if you take a look over

567
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,880
here

568
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,160
we have a blank white page which is

569
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,520
going to become very important in a

570
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,160
moment

571
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,360
and this is the attacker

572
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,840
terminal section so let's go ahead and

573
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,320
bring it back

574
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,440
virtual machine that's not connected

575
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,880
into authenticated if we

576
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
password

577
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,080
request our two factor authentication

578
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,799
code

579
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,039
that

580
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,400
and there we go it's telling us that

581
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,919
two-step authentication is enabled

582
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,919
we just heard a message coming into my

583
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,600
mobile device we're going to uncheck

584
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,559
this box

585
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,159
that says recognize this device in the

586
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,159
future and open my mobile

587
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
it's going to log us into highway pit

588
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,919
account

589
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,200
so now we're logged in somewhere

590
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,960
let's take a look at the attacker's

591
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,240
session over

592
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,159
here on the left so we're going to scoot

593
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,840
this over to the right

594
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,039
and over here this is not the

595
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,080
actual six digit code that was

596
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,679
intercepted because you can't really use

597
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,120
the six digit code again

598
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,959
the second factor but what we're

599
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,919
the session key into a browser and they

600
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,880
actually become

601
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,720
you so let me check out this one we're

602
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,880
going to highlight

603
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,799
we're going to copy it to the clipboard

604
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:31,280
and then we're simply going to open up

605
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
but we don't have to do so we're going

606
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,720
to go ahead and go into developer tools

607
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
we're going to go into the console what

608
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,039
we're going to paste into the console

609
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,159
is the session cookie that we sold from

610
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,640
the victor

611
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,240
so pretty wild huh um

612
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,440
i don't think anyone that's seen

613
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,840
something like this for the first time

614
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,760
uh doesn't fail to be a little

615
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,360
impressed with it and uh

616
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,280
you know and when this first came out uh

617
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
kevin was you know again inundated

618
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,880
people know well is microsoft going to

619
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,400
fix this and

620
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
you know people ask did we or were we

621
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,760
going to report it as a

622
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,320
new cve common vulnerability exploit

623
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,120
we're like no

624
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,039
it's the opposite of new it's been done

625
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,320
this way for 30

626
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,520
years uh kevin used a hacker tool called

627
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,000
evil

628
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
jinx that sets up it can set up as a

629
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,440
bunch of different man-in-the-middle

630
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,799
proxies

631
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,679
and it's been around for 10 or 12 years

632
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,720
it's been hacking around

633
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,760
mfa for seven eight years and there are

634
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,840
literally dozens if not hundreds of ways

635
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,559
to do this

636
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,720
uh even if you're older like me there

637
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,919
used to be a browser

638
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,039
if you used to well along probably about

639
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,240
10 years ago

640
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,640
firefox was a really popular browser and

641
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,919
some guy came out with something called

642
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:20,880
firesheet

643
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,400
and you could use you could just add

644
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,080
this add-in to your fire

645
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,960
fox browser push a button and capture

646
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,440
everybody's cookies you could go into a

647
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,919
coffee shop and then just just snag

648
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,520
everybody's cookie and that's before

649
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,360
everything was https

650
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,159
encrypted uh but again this works this

651
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,280
type of attack

652
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,640
works against probably 90 percent of mfa

653
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,880
there's some types of mfa like 502 that

654
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,400
it won't work against because there's a

655
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,240
pre-registration of the device and

656
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,159
pre-registration on the website

657
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,400
but most of your time-based one-time

658
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
passwords and google authenticator and

659
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,080
microsoft authenticator

660
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,320
and linkedin and all stuff they're all

661
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,240
subject to this sort of attack

662
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,919
it happens in the real world all the

663
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,520
time here's a news story where

664
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,360
cryptocurren the poor cryptocurrency

665
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,039
people they're hacked all the time

666
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,960
but this guy got tricked into going to a

667
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,480
fake finance website

668
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
clients is like coinbase it allows you

669
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,520
to buy and sell and trade

670
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,279
cryptocurrencies

671
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
but he got tricked into going to a fake

672
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,880
finance website

673
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,720
and it stole his login credentials

674
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
including his

675
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,320
his you know his 2fa code that was sent

676
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,480
to him by google authenticator

677
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,840
uh so you know he thought he was

678
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,360
protected because he was using

679
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,200
multi-factor authentication with google

680
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,000
authenticator

681
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,919
but it didn't help them this has been

682
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,520
going on for decades

683
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
uh here's some other news stories where

684
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,039
iranian fishers bypass

685
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,440
2fa protections offered by yahoo mail

686
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
and gmail

687
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,799
it says here you know the the victims

688
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,880
would enter passwords into a fake gmail

689
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,200
or yahoo security page and the attackers

690
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,559
almost simultaneously enter the

691
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,720
credentials into the real login page

692
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,400
in the event that the targets the

693
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,640
victims accounts were protected by 2fa

694
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
the attackers would redirect the targets

695
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,760
to a new page that requested the

696
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,960
one-time password

697
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,039
and would steal it with the man in the

698
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,640
middle attack so

699
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,600
this has been done all the time um

700
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,039
another popular way

701
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,480
is what that was called main in the

702
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,960
middle uh this i just call man in the

703
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,640
endpoint but you know the idea is that

704
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,960
if your device gets compromised by

705
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,480
hackers or malware the device that

706
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,520
you're using

707
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,200
the hacker or the malware can do

708
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,039
anything that you can do

709
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,320
so if you uh you know if you they

710
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,159
kind of don't care how you authenticate

711
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,760
they just wait till you authenticate

712
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,240
and then they take over your computer or

713
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,880
they

714
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,400
most of the time they'll start a second

715
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,640
hidden browser session in windows and

716
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,559
linux and match you can actually

717
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,919
start a second desktop session that the

718
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,919
current login user can't see

719
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,080
but it will still use the same cookies

720
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,919
and same mfa

721
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,159
so you know they can insert back doors

722
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,240
and key loggers they can steal your

723
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,799
network access control token they can

724
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,039
invalidate your protection altogether

725
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,559
but a really popular one that's been

726
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,400
around since the 80s

727
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,640
uh the late 80s is called it's called

728
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,559
bancos trojans which means banking

729
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,200
trojan

730
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,279
either portuguese or spanish but the

731
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,720
reason why these are called bankos

732
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,360
trojans

733
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,919
when they first appeared in the 80s they

734
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,120
were mostly happening

735
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,840
in brazil and south america because

736
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,600
brazil and south america had banks but

737
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,360
they didn't have a lot of atms so

738
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
they're the first

739
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,039
cultures to go online you know with

740
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,000
ebanks a whole

741
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,320
lot uh but what these banking trillions

742
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,679
doing they're still around today

743
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,760
they've stolen they've stolen billions

744
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,520
of dollars a year

745
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,080
is they they infect your computer like

746
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,279
any malware

747
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,039
you know any malware that you know worm

748
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,720
virus trojan or whatever gets into your

749
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,320
system so social engineering

750
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,960
unpatched software whatever they infect

751
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,840
your system

752
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,080
and then they monitor where your browser

753
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,840
goes on the internet so they they look

754
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,400
at the you

755
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,840
every time you type in something it's

756
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,600
constantly checking the url

757
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,120
and then when you go to your bank if

758
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,200
it's one of the you know 200 banks

759
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,080
they're looking for

760
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,840
they kind of perk up they wait for you

761
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,919
to log on in they don't care how you log

762
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,760
on in whether you use mfa or not

763
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,200
but as soon as you've successfully

764
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,960
logged in in the background they open a

765
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,080
second hidden browser

766
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,400
session and steal all your money so you

767
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,679
think you're just checking your bank

768
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,440
balance or you're transferring you know

769
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
100 bucks to your kid or something like

770
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,080
that but

771
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,320
all of a sudden in you know seconds

772
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,799
you're robbed all your money is gone

773
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,320
uh and they've been around forever

774
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,520
here's a news story from 2019

775
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,399
said uh 11 members of a it was called

776
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,640
the guys and them malware network

777
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,399
they used a stealthy banking drudge who

778
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,159
still a hundred million dollars and

779
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,360
that's just what the law enforcement

780
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,159
knows about from 41 000 victims

781
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,039
uh there are hundreds of these groups in

782
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:39,760
the world

783
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,520
that are constantly stealing billions of

784
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,960
dollars every year

785
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,679
called banking trojans uh they even do

786
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,640
they've moved on to the mobile platforms

787
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,000
i'm not going to play this video here

788
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
but this is a video where

789
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,159
uh it's kind of neat the trojan would

790
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,120
pretend to be

791
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,159
an android battery optimization app and

792
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,840
if people downloaded it to make their

793
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,760
android last longer before it ran out of

794
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,880
the batteries

795
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,640
it would uh it would wait till it would

796
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,919
just it would do nothing

797
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,240
until the user at some point in time

798
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,440
logged into paypal

799
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,360
and when they logged into paypal it

800
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,120
would all suddenly kick off a bunch of

801
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,240
keystrokes

802
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,320
so the user logs into paypal and if you

803
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,399
look in that video you can see the

804
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,520
keystrokes happening

805
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,600
in about a second or two but by the time

806
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,960
the person like what the heck is going

807
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,679
on there

808
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,840
they're back to the normal paypal screen

809
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,120
and they don't realize that their money

810
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,399
just got stolen

811
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,080
uh today a lot of mobile phone malware

812
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,720
like eventbot is a very popular one all

813
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,799
it is is a mobile banking trojan that

814
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,840
steals money

815

816
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
different financial institutions like

817
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,520

all that sort of stuff and you know

822
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,080
again it even

823
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,840
if you look down here on the in the left

824
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,360
hand corner

825
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
it said not only can it grab passwords

826
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,120
for more than 200 financial applications

827
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,559
but it intercepts the two-factor

828
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,720
authentication codes as well

829
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,760
it pose uh uh eventbot was posing as a

830
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,240
flash

831
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,039

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,000
uh you know website they go to all the

834
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,440
time it's like oh you need a flash

835
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:15,840
update

836
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,279

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,320
if it's in case it's sms based mfa

841
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,360
so very common uh speaking of that as

842
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,240
any sms short messaging service based

843
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,720
the most

844
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,840
common uh mfa on the internet today is

845
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,520
probably sms based we're all used to

846
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,960
getting those codes from our vendors

847
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,000
here's a selection

848
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,039
of codes i'm getting from my marriott

849
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,159
from facebook from office 365 in the

850
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,320
bottom left bank of america

851
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
uh you know they send you these codes

852
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,600
that you have to type into your browser

853
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,559
or whatever

854
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,679
um uh you know what's amazing about

855
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,520
these things is that

856
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,440
your phone uh sms

857
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
the the most authentication you can ever

858
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,760
have is that it's tied to a phone number

859
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,200
and if you don't recognize that phone

860
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,039
number you don't really know who that is

861
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,399
so i can send you a message

862
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,320
claiming to be bill gates and you

863
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,919
wouldn't know whether or not it's bill

864
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:14,960
gates

865
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,559
but there's a lot of different ways to

866
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,240
hack sms based

867
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,120
mfa one of the most common ways is

868
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,080
something called sim

869
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,799
swap sim stands for subscriber identity

870
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,760
module

871
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,440
used to be all the cell phones came with

872
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,039
this little micro sd

873
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,240
chip and if if you're older like me that

874
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,880
chip would be

875
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,039
behind your battery and your phone and

876
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,559
if you want to remove it you remove your

877
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,200
battery and

878
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,559
get to that chip and then they started

879
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,240
making a little sim

880
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,480
uh storage slot on the phone and if you

881
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,000
had to knock it out you had to get a

882
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,960
paper clip

883
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,799
these days most of the time they don't

884
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,200
have a separate micro sd card it's just

885
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,360
a virtual area on your phone

886
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,320
but that sim uh subscriber identity

887
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,120
module that

888
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,360
it's just memory storage area that

889
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
stores a bunch of different information

890
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,120
that makes your phone your phone

891
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,200
and assigns your phone number to that

892
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,919
phone that subscriber identity module

893
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:07,679
has a global unique

894
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,760
unique identifier for your phone so no

895
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,360
matter where it goes in the world

896
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,840
it can be tracked and used and phone

897
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,360
number sent to it's got your phone

898
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,360
number it's got your name

899
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,080
and what hackers found out is that they

900
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,120
could if they could

901
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,480
get your sim information uh

902
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,760
sent to their cell phone that their cell

903
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,000
phone became your phone

904
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,760
so that all that happens when they get

905
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
that information sent is your cell phone

906
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,120
stops working and

907
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,799
you use most people don't realize that

908
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,159
it's occurred

909
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,240
because all it is is that it's silent

910
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,600
all of a sudden they're not getting

911
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,360
messages they're not getting uh

912
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,840
phone calls if they look maybe let's see

913
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,360
an adam network message

914
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,279
and like why is my phone at a message a

915
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,799
lot of people probably think oh it must

916
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,080
be in a bad area

917
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,600
and it probably takes some hours to

918
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,039
figure out what's going on they call

919
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,480
their cell phone company

920
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,159
eventually using somebody else's phone

921
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,760
the cell phone comes like oh you know mr

922
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,360
grimes you transferred your

923
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,240
your sim information to your new phone

924
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,000
you're like what new phone

925
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,120
and it's because you've been some

926
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,039
swapped attack a lot of times

927
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,200
they will the hackers involved with this

928
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,880
will pre-text you and they'll they'll

929
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,279
scan you to either call you or email you

930
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,440
claiming to be your cell phone company

931
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,080
get your login name and or password out

932
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,519
then they'll call your cell phone

933
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,480
company later on

934
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,240
claimed to be you that you've got a new

935
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
cell phone because your cell phone got

936
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,039
destroyed

937
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,799
but they've they fished out of you

938
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,720
enough information that they can log in

939
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,480
they can convince the cell phone company

940
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,840
that they are you and get it

941
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,519
get that information the same

942
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,240
information swap to the new cell phone

943
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
or they actually have it's pretty common

944
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
for them to have insiders

945
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,480
that they'll pay 50 or 75 bucks they'll

946
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,000
call won't go hey i need you to do a sim

947
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,760
swap on this number and they

948
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,440
and the person inside the company just

949
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,240
does it uh it happens all the time i

950
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,080
don't know how often you know hundreds

951
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,320
thousands of times a day it's it's

952
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,640
abused so badly the us government

953
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,679
in 2017 so four years ago

954
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,360
and something called the uh nist

955
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,960
national institute standards of

956
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,120
technology digital identity guidelines

957
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,399
is this special publication 800-63

958
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,760
it's the us government's uh proclamation

959
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,440
on what people should use for computer

960
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,399
authentication

961
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,600
they said don't use sms-based mfa it can

962
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:19,919
be

963
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,720
faked it can be stolen it can be

964
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,000
misdirected and it's

965
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,440
so weak because remember at most

966
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,399
sms is being tracked to a phone number

967
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,480
and i can get your phone number moved to

968
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,440
any phone

969
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,519
it's really not that secure and it's

970
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,559
been used to steal

971
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,200
hundreds of millions of dollars that top

972
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,279
one there the smartphone crypto hack one

973
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,279
cryptocurrency guy lost 24

974
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,640
million dollars uh i think he sued at t

975
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,000
for 121 million

976
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,760
i need to look up and see if they

977
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,399
settled that out of court or not

978
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,600
but even like red edit red edits admin

979
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,840
people for red edit love that love red

980
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,640
edit ask me anything

981
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,159
red edit guys their admins used sms

982
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,799
based mfa but one of them got sim

983
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,000
swapped attacked

984
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
and then he lost that and you know he

985
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,040
got some swap attack and

986
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,440
the bad guys logged in as admin reset

987
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,879
everybody else's account

988
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,199
uh installed malware stole customer

989
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,320
information

990
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,560
uh it's a big big deal some swapping

991
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,679
attacks you know even

992
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,280
if you look at the bottom left this

993
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,960
advertisement here it says california

994
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,800
authorities say a 20-year-old college

995
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,719
student hijacked more than 40

996
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,760
phone numbers and sold 5 million

997
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,839
right teenagers or near teenagers

998
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,000
selling this sort of stuff so i tell

999
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,879
people

1000
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,918
don't use sms based applications

1001
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,560
uh mfa applications if you can avoid it

1002
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,440
here's the problem

1003
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,079
it is the most popular type of mfa on

1004
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,440
the internet today

1005
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,960
and you usually don't have a choice

1006
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,239
whether or not you're going to use it

1007
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:52,719
you

1008
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,119
you know your your the company or the

1009
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,639
vendor or the software product that

1010
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,839
you're dealing with is like hey we're

1011
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:58,560

message and you don't get to choose

1014
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,359
whether you use it or not

1015
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,200
or even if you decide not to use it

1016
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,960
somebody else the attacker could fake

1017
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,400
being you put your account

1018
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,320
in account recovery mode and have that

1019
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,839
sent to you as a matter of fact this is

1020
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:14,160
called

1021
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,560
sms rogue recovery where all the

1022
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
attacker has to do is have your email

1023
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,480
address and phone number

1024
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,000
to some type of uh to an email account

1025
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
or login account that can be in recovery

1026
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,079
mode and send an sms message and they

1027
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:28,480
can

1028
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,640
fake being that person like this example

1029
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,200
here the attacker fakes from being uh

1030
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,320
from google

1031
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,400
security like we're from google security

1032
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,920
you know we have detected a rogue

1033

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,520
legitimate login we're going to send a

1037
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,359
registered phone number from another

1039
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,160
number please re-type the sent

1040
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,920

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,440
message or your account will be

1042
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,800
permanently locked

1043
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,160
gotta threaten people let them know

1044
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,320
their accounts go away forever then the

1045
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,000
attacker just tries to log in

1046
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,720
goes to gmail tries to log in using your

1047
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,760
email address

1048
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,000
tells gmail oh i forgot my password

1049
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,960

1051
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,160
and if you say no i'm going to try

1052
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,440
another way we'll ask you which of the

1053
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,119
five ways do you want to try

1054
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,480
one of the ways that you can recover

1055
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,720
your account is that so even if you

1056
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,400
didn't want to use sms

1057
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,599
based uh recovery the hacker can you

1058
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,280
you cannot turn that off as a method of

1059
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,119
recovery um it's just one of the five

1060
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,720
that google allows

1061
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,440
and then they send you a code and if you

1062
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,720
don't know you know

1063
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
this is a real google verification good

1064
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,400
if you're the victim and you type this

1065
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,680
in response

1066
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,760
the attacker takes that in uses that for

1067
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,960
her account recovery

1068
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,480

are who you say you are

1098
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,599
and then they just reset the person's

1099
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,680
account the person tells them to code

1100
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,320
over the phone

1101
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,640
and it's game over this happens again

1102
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,040
hundreds to thousands of times a day

1103
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,880
they claim to be from your bank or your

1104
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,400
hotel company or your

1105
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,440
uh you know your airline company and

1106
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,480
you can't trust who somebody is on the

1107
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:52,960
phone

1108
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
if you don't recognize their voice and

1109
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,720
these days with deep fakes you never

1110
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,680
know

1111
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,400
but uh this is really this this

1112
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,920
particular news story here

1113
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,480
was this uh a guy a lawyer that protect

1114
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,680
that uh

1115
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,520
protected hackers or he represents

1116
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,960
hackers trying to stop hackers from

1117
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,079
going to jail

1118
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,480
and he got scammed to the point where he

1119
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,400
actually gave the code and it was only

1120
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,920
after he gave the code

1121
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,520
and he actually was lucky enough he was

1122
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
logged into his email his uh banking

1123
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,200
account at the same time

1124
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,680
and he didn't see any fake transactions

1125
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,359
before he gave his code but from the

1126
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,040
moment that he gave his code he started

1127
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,520
to see fraudulent transactions happen

1128
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,359
so he figured out what was going on

1129
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,720
there but this is really

1130
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,640
you know you got to watch out for it

1131
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,079
uh you know be worried and you know you

1132
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,240
can't trust messages on instagram or

1133
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,760
paypal or whatever whether

1134
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,200
yeah you know you're we think someone's

1135
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,960
trying to log into your account sign in

1136
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,760
here

1137
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,160
you know you just can't trust these sort

1138
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,960
of you know

1139
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,680
fake alerts or people saying that they

1140
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,880
are who they are

1141
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,640
so defenses are you know be aware of

1142
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,400
rogue recovery messages

1143
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,240
recognize that if someone sends you a

1144
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,920
pen you almost never

1145
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,480
type it back in response to the the

1146
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,560
message you almost always put it into a

1147
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,680
browser

1148
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,160
uh in another chain you call it out of

1149
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,119
you know out of a

1150
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,280
channel attack or at a channel a second

1151
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,240
channel

1152
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,839
um you know but avoid using sms based

1153
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:20,480
mfa

1154
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,119
whenever you can uh if you can because

1155
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:23,760
it just

1156
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,839
can't be trusted out of all the types of

1157
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,119
mfa that are out there

1158
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,560
msn mss based ones are probably

1159
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,599
among the easiest ones to hack um and

1160
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,920
let me say the telephone companies

1161
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,160
understand about these sim swapping

1162
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,200
attacks

1163
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,800
because some swapping has been going on

1164
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,400
for 20 years

1165
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,960
uh and so the telephone companies train

1166
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,520
their

1167
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,040
technical support people not to

1168
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,800
do the same swap attacks you know unless

1169
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,200
they're criminal being paid to do it but

1170
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,520
you know the hackers will call up these

1171
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,280
tech support people at 18

1172
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,680
t and verizon t-mobile and try to trick

1173
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,520
them into transferring that sim

1174
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,160
information well the telephone companies

1175
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
tell the technicians

1176
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,440
the tech support people follow this

1177
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,920
script and if you always follow this

1178
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,839
script you'll never get tricked and

1179
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,599
you'll protect yourself and protect your

1180
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,760
customers and that sort of stuff but

1181
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,839
any tech support person can be socially

1182
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,520
engineered by a really good social

1183
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,400
engineer

1184
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,480
uh you know they they'll call up they'll

1185
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,920
claim to be the customer that there's

1186
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,319
some big stressful event going on

1187
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,240
uh and then get them to do something for

1188
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,079
them again i'm not gonna i don't have

1189
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,680
time to play this clip either but

1190
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,200
i'm gonna give you all i'm gonna give

1191
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,720
you all my slides when i'm through so

1192
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,119
you can

1193
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,200
go look at these links but this

1194
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,359
particular youtube video is a great one

1195
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,560
to watch because

1196
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,599
a reporter uh went to uh

1197
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,680
wasn't black cat it was defcon he went

1198
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,960
to defcom

1199
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,119
and he talked to a female social

1200
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,560
engineer and he said hey i've been

1201
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,240
having a lot of hacking on my cell phone

1202
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,880
lately so i told my cell phone company

1203
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,200
we created this new pin number that

1204
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,160
they're not allowed to

1205
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,560
to do a sim swap or do anything unless

1206
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,359
they know this

1207
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,760
secret pin number i want to see if you

1208
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,920
can socially engineer my telephone

1209
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,640
company

1210
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,640
into giving you control of my phone

1211
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,400
account so he gave her

1212
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,720
uh he told she told him the name of the

1213
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,880
cell phone company which i think was a t

1214
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,960
and his phone number and from that he

1215
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,640
said i want to see if you can

1216
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,319
socially engineer them out of my

1217
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,480
information she did it in five minutes

1218
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,440
she downloaded two videos of babies

1219
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,000
crying and then she pretended to be

1220
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,560
a female with sick hungry starving

1221
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,079
babies so the babies are crying in the

1222
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,440
background she calls

1223
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,160
uh you know att tech support she claims

1224
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,280
to be the wife

1225
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,880
of the guy that she was supposed to

1226
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
transfer their funds they're moving

1227
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,440
and she's just to transfer the phones uh

1228
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,640
and uh

1229
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,240
she was laid in doing it and she's got

1230
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,000
the babies like i'm sorry i got two

1231
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,520
babies sick and the crime she's like yes

1232
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,359
honey i'm doing it i'm doing it so she

1233
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,359
acts like she's being bowed

1234
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,240
valerie by the husband um because she's

1235
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,920
not doing it so the tech

1236
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,000
does the tech support person help her

1237
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,440
out absolutely

1238
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
she knows nothing the tech support

1239
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,520
person asks her the email account or the

1240
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,440
login names that he uses

1241
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,599
she just takes guesses the tech support

1242
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,560
person says no

1243
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,319
no that's not it that's not it how about

1244
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,839
this one this one's not for me

1245
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,520
oh yeah that's his old email account

1246
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,880
that he used to use

1247
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,319
she goes do you know the password she's

1248
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,160
like no i i can't remember honey i'm

1249
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,440
trying to get it done i promise i'm

1250
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,720
trying to get it done

1251
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,040
and the tech support person att just

1252
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,200
gives her not only gives her the email

1253
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
and the email account and password and

1254
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,800
lecture to take control of the account

1255
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,640
but she the the social engineer then

1256
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,720
says oh my my daughter is going to

1257
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
college moved into a dorm today can i

1258
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,040
get her a phone charged to my account oh

1259
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,720
i can thank you very much

1260
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,480
and you can just see the reporter going

1261
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,160
he just can't believe

1262
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,040
how easy it was uh to social engineer

1263
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,359
tech support but that's the way it is

1264
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,680
um another type of a hack these are

1265
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,400
pretty

1266
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,560
i don't say super common attacks well

1267
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,079
they're not uncommon but they're not

1268
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,200
super common

1269
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,920
uh but a lot of us have these time one

1270
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,200
time based password

1271
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,040
tokens it used to be back when i first

1272
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,480
started in computers the only

1273
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,319
mfa that was out there is these rsa

1274
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,079
secure id keys

1275
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,599
uh and they have this code you know it

1276
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,280
changes every minute you know you got to

1277
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,319
type in the code

1278
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,000
these days a lot of us probably the most

1279
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,599
common mfa that isn't

1280
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,560
mss in sms base is probably google

1281
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,680
authenticator

1282
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,520
uh you know but you know every minute

1283
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
you get this six digit code and you only

1284
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,880
get a minute to use it

1285
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,319
all of us that use these sort of

1286
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,160
time-based one-time password

1287
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,079
things we all know the stress of trying

1288
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,839
to type in this six digit code before it

1289
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,079
expires we have to type in another one

1290
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,920
but the way that they work all of them

1291
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,760
is that when they're set up

1292
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,440
something generates what's called a

1293
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,599
shared seed value just a randomly

1294
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,280
generated number

1295
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,280
and that number has to be stored on the

1296
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,839
device or the software instance

1297
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,480
that's generating the seed number or the

1298
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,200
the the

1299
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,319
changing number so that seed value is

1300
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,520
randomly generated

1301
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,960
it's stored in the authentication

1302
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
database it's stored on the device or in

1303
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,079
the software

1304
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,880
uh then what's usually in a database is

1305
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,640
a global unique identifier

1306
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,240
it's either tied to a global unique

1307
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,000
identifier or the person's email

1308
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
address or something it's usually tied

1309
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,640
uniquely to that instance

1310
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,040
and then there's an algorithm so they

1311
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,920
take the c

1312
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,720
value plus the global unique identifier

1313
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,800
the device or software instance

1314
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,720
and then there's an algorithm that then

1315
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,240
adds the current time

1316
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,240
and that time will generate this six

1317
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
digit code that's not supposed to repeat

1318
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,200
anytime soon

1319
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
it's only good for a minute but the

1320
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,400
problem is is that

1321
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,560
if someone gets a hold of that see that

1322
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,640
seed value database because that shared

1323
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,160
secret has to be in at least those

1324
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,240
shared secrets have to be

1325
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,720
not only in that device but also have to

1326
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,040
be in the authentication database and in

1327
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,359
the case of rsa secure ids

1328
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,200
though that shared secret value is going

1329
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,800
to be at the rsa company

1330
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,880
or will be at your company like on a

1331
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,520
separate server next to your web server

1332
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,839
and attackers will find those databases

1333
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,520
and if they find the databases that have

1334
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,960
the seed value

1335
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,880
and the global unique identifier for the

1336
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,079
device or software instance

1337
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,560
they can create additional unauthorized

1338
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,200
instances

1339
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,760
of those devices and i used to use a

1340
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,839
program called cane enable back in the

1341
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,359
early 90s

1342
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,119
uh you still download canon enable

1343
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,480
although i say be careful

1344
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
it has been updated in like 10 years and

1345
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,760
it could have a trojan

1346
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,440
these days but a lot of people used to

1347
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,599
use canon able and it had an rsa secure

1348
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:24,480
id token

1349
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,400
generator so you had to have the serial

1350
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,160
number which is on the back of anybody's

1351
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,280
rsa key

1352
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,040
and then you had to have that seed value

1353
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,319
they called it a key but it's just a

1354
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,079
seed value and if you put that in there

1355
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,359
you could then create virtual instances

1356
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,319
of that rsa secure id and this was

1357
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,319
actually done in a real world attack

1358
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,560
chinese advanced persistent threat broke

1359
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,680
into rsa

1360
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,440
they broke an rsa using social

1361
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
engineering they sent emails to a bunch

1362
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,119
of employees that had

1363
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,680
uh microsoft word and excel documents

1364
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,160
that had

1365
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,560
macros in them and i was at microsoft at

1366
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,280
the time

1367
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,119
and and it's funny the employees in

1368
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,240
order for the employees to be

1369
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,160
compromised they had to say

1370
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,240
run this malicious code run this one

1371
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,160
they got three prompts i said be careful

1372
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,839
this could be malicious are you sure you

1373
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,280
want to run it and they did

1374
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,960
but then the chinese advanced persistent

1375
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,800
threat hackers broke into rsa

1376
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,440
they sold everybody's rsa seed value

1377
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,520
databases including lockheed martin

1378
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,079
they then generated additional instances

1379
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,240
of lockheed martin's rsa secure ids

1380
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,760
broke into lockheed martin stole some

1381
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,520
military secrets so

1382
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,400
it happens in real life happens more

1383
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,319
with google authenticator though google

1384
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,200
authenticator

1385
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,040
if you use that before usually you'll be

1386
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,760
sent this qr code quick response code

1387
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,400
that that qr code really is just an 80

1388
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:38,960
bit

1389
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,520
number it's just the c value and if

1390
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,000
anybody

1391
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,839
can get the wild thing is that code

1392
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,040
never expires

1393
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,440
if any hacker ever comes across your qr

1394
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,079
code they can set up an instance of your

1395
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,560
google authenticator and it will never

1396
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,599
expire

1397
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,760
and create a second uh you know a second

1398
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,720
instance of it

1399
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,400
uh here's a news story or here's what

1400
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
somebody was posting right at it he had

1401
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,240
had a bunch of cryptocurrency stolen

1402
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,520
this guy he said

1403
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,079
he goes i'm now 95 certain as to how the

1404
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:07,760
2fa was bypassed

1405
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,520
uh when i set up google authenticator

1406
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,000
for 2fa i left a copy of the key in my

1407
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,599
email anybody reading this should

1408
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,280
probably be shaking their head the moral

1409
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,240
of the story is

1410
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,319
when you're signing up for 2fa destroy

1411
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,680
the key that was used

1412
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,960
i know a lot of people that take

1413
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,880
pictures of that key the save for

1414
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,480
safekeeping in case they have to set it

1415
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,839
up again i know a lot of people are

1416
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,440
keeping an email i know a lot of people

1417
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,800
that delete it but they don't delete

1418
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,319
their trash can ever so it's really

1419
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:31,280
still in there

1420
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,280
hackers look for these um for these

1421
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,480
google authentic

1422
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,240
qr codes and if they find them they

1423
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,079
create a second instance

1424
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,839
and it's game over because they can now

1425
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,799
pretend to be you

1426
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,400
and again google authenticator uses an

1427
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,640
80-bit secret key

1428
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,000
us government says that any uh one-time

1429
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,839
password device should use a

1430
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,200
minimum of 128-bit key because 80 bits

1431
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,520
is

1432
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,920
too weak and can be hacked but that's

1433
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,520
kind of beside the point

1434
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,720
but the idea is remember anytime

1435
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,559
someone's trying to crack a one-time

1436
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,000
password device they have to know the

1437
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,760
seed value in this case it's the qr

1438
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,240
the 80-bit value of this and the qr code

1439
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,400
they've got to know the instance

1440
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,960
uh and it's typically tied to a

1441
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,400
typically tied to someone's email

1442
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:20,960
address

1443
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,640
usually a gmail address plus an

1444
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,960
application or a login of some sort

1445
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,160
and then they have to know the google

1446
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,599
authenticator algorithm well it turns

1447
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,599
out google authenticator was a public

1448
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:30,240
algorithm

1449
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,640
it started out google authenticator is a

1450
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,240
public project and you can still

1451
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,640
download a project called pharaoh

1452
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,359
from github and you put in that c value

1453
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,520
hit enter and boom it starts to tell you

1454
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
what the next value is going to be

1455
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,920
so it's not that hard to generate a

1456
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,760
additional instance of the google

1457
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,680
authenticator if you can find that

1458
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,800
c value and there's actually many more

1459
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,680
attacks against google authenticator

1460
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,079
another attack type is where suppose you

1461
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,920
require 2fa

1462
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,000
the website you most of the time you can

1463
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,520
go recover it what all the

1464
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,359
major mfa vendors gmail and microsoft

1465
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,880
and yahoo and stuff

1466
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,200
they really you know they realize that

1467
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,680
people lose their mfa solution

1468
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,760
their cell phone gets lost they lose

1469
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,880
their password or whatever so they

1470
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,040
always have these reset options

1471
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,119
almost all of these reset options are

1472
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,720
not mfa so you can actually require mfa

1473
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,480
but then someone can go in and reset

1474
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,240
your account and tell it to send it to

1475
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,160
your alternate email account most of us

1476
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,359
are used to this where you can have this

1477
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,160
recovery email a recovery phone

1478
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,160
uh and if it's in a recovery email a lot

1479
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,000
of times hackers will

1480
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,079
hack that alternate email account that

1481
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,000
you don't use a whole lot then put your

1482
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,920
main account in recovery mode and get it

1483
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,720
that way

1484
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,800
but the absolute worst recovery method

1485
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,079
is known as personal

1486
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,599
knowledge questions or i call them

1487
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,359
password reset questions but those are

1488
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:51,839
where

1489
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,520
you know you're resetting your password

1490
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,520
okay you must tell us what your mother's

1491
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,040
maiden name is

1492
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,880
uh whoever thought your mother's maiden

1493
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,880
name was a secret right like

1494
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,720
anybody can look that up or you know

1495
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,079
what's your favorite vet

1496
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,440
if i know where you live i can probably

1497
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,440
do a search find and find the three

1498
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
closest vets to you and put in one of

1499
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,720
those vets and it's probably gonna be

1500
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,359
your favorite

1501
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,000
bet or what's your favorite car well

1502
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,520
your password could be a trillion

1503
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,640
different things that i would never

1504
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,880
guess but your favorite car

1505
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,640
there's only a hundred different car

1506
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,040
models in the world at any given time

1507
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,800
they don't change that much

1508
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,520
decade or year to year even decade a

1509
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,319
decade

1510
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,920
and most people's favorite car is

1511
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,440
probably not going to be an

1512
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,680
amc gremler or pacer it's probably going

1513
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,160
to be a mustang a lamborghini

1514
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,800
you know something a maserati you know

1515
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,040
or alexis or something like that

1516
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,839
i bet i can guess most people's favorite

1517
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,400
car

1518
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,520
within 10 guesses you know and i'm not

1519
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,440
again i'm not an uber hacker

1520
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,359
uh but you know what google actually did

1521
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,200
a white paper called secret lies on the

1522
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,720
account recovering from the use of

1523
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,640
personal knowledge questions at google

1524
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,480
and what they found is is that

1525
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,720
some recovery questions can be guessed

1526
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,680
on the first try

1527
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,640
20 of the time so one out of five

1528
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,160
questions can be guessed on the first

1529
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,319
try by a hacker 40

1530
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,920
of the time people are unable to

1531
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,760
successfully recall their own recovery

1532
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,359
answers i don't know what that means to

1533
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,319
you except for maybe

1534
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,400
if you can't remember your answer you

1535
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,920
should call a hacker

1536
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,960
that's what i think uh 16 one of the one

1537
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,520
out of six

1538
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,280
of the answers could be found a person's

1539
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,960
social media profile

1540
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,559
uh these personal knowledge questions

1541
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,480
are used to take over people's accounts

1542
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,200
all the time

1543
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,880
probably the most well-known attack was

1544
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,240
against sarah palin

1545
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,240
when she was running with john mccain

1546
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,319
against uh biden and obama

1547
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,720
what is amazing fighting back in office

1548
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,240
uh but there is a

1549
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,720
kid a college kid of a democratic

1550
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,599
representative

1551
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,760
and he hacked sarah palin's yahoo

1552
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,079
account stole her emails and put them on

1553
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,079
4chan or 8chan he got arrested with

1554
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,240
jail but when they asked him how he did

1555
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,119
it he said oh

1556
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,119
i put her account in account recovery

1557
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,280
mode and it asked three questions one

1558
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,920
was

1559
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,760
where she'd met her husband which was

1560
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,359
high school

1561
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,280
the other one was where she went to high

1562
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,520
school is wasilla alaska there's only

1563
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,760
one high school in wassel alaska and the

1564
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,079
last question was what zip code

1565
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,599
she lived in turns out there's only two

1566
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,079
zip codes in wasilla alaska so he

1567
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,760
answered the three questions he said it

1568
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,359
took him about an hour in google to find

1569
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,160
the answers

1570
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,920
and then he took over account and her

1571
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,520
emails and you know it's again

1572
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,160
so what are the defenses uh when you're

1573
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,520
asked to put in the answers to these

1574
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,200
things this is not jeopardy

1575
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,640
don't put in the real answers when they

1576
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,319
go what is your mother's maiden name

1577

pizza pizza don't put in the real answer

1581
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,680
you should put in really a different

1582
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,720
answer you should treat them like

1583
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,760
passwords

1584
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,160
but don't put in the real you're crazy

1585
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,079
if you put in the real answers to

1586
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,520
what is your what is your high school

1587

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,359
somebody can look that up but they're

1589
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,559
not going to be able to guess pizza

1590
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,040
pizza

1591
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,720
pizza geek ad so when i have to fill

1592
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,520
these out

1593
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,839
i actually put nonsense answers in them

1594
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,440
they don't know that you're lying to

1595
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,119
them most of the time you've got to put

1596
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,640
different answers in each one of these

1597
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,079
the bad thing is i have to write them

1598
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,599
down i have to write down what the what

1599
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,839
the secret question was and what my fake

1600
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,599
answer was and i put it in a password

1601
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:10,720
manager

1602
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,160
you know it's not thrilling but that's

1603
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,520
what i do but you should not put the

1604
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,880
real what you know what's your father's

1605
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,440
birthday

1606
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,640
is there somebody that can't go on a

1607
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,640
genealogy website and find that

1608
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,599
information

1609
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,200
it's just crazy uh biometrics i'm not a

1610
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,119
big fan of biometrics when they're used

1611
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,040
as single factors which they are

1612
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,280
most the time uh they're not that

1613
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,559
accurate at all

1614
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,880
uh the most biometrics are hideously

1615
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,000
inaccurate

1616
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
uh but my biggest problem with them is

1617
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,839
that once they're stolen

1618
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,160
they're stolen for life like i was part

1619
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,359
of if you look at the bottom of the

1620
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,480
screen there

1621
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,880
my password all my fingerprints all 10

1622
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,720
of my fingerprints were stolen

1623
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,800
by a chinese apt attack against the

1624
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,839
united states government in june 2015.

1625
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,599
they stole every the fingerprints of

1626
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,839
everybody that had ever applied for a

1627
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,079
u.s government security clearance which

1628
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,000
i had done through microsoft

1629
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,400
uh my wife had her fingerprints stolen

1630
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,920
even though the only time she had her

1631
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,520
fingerprint applied for security

1632
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,520
clearance is when she was a teenager

1633
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,319
back in the 80s working for a shipyard

1634
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,920
uh but if you would apply for a

1635
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,359
government security clearance and they

1636
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,880
had your fingerprints on file

1637
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,680
uh the chinese apt got that obama uh

1638
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,119
eventually asked president

1639
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,119
uh the the current president of china as

1640
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,720
a matter of fact z or how do you

1641
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,959
forget

1642
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,240
he asked for the database back and china

1643
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,240
gave the database back

1644
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,599
you know one of the odds are they didn't

1645
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,920
make a copy like literally anything that

1646
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,160
relies upon my fingerprint

1647
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,119
how can they trust that it really is me

1648
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:39,680
and

1649
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,000
let me say biometrics are stolen all the

1650
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,640
time here's a breach from 2019

1651
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,040
where a top 50 biometric app had a

1652
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,680
thousand

1653
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,440
finger or a million fingerprints

1654
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,359
breached some white hat hackers

1655
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,599
told them reported hey your website will

1656
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,440
allow anybody to download anybody's

1657
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,480
fingerprints

1658
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,400
that company would not respond to them

1659
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,240
it did not fix the problem for

1660
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,880
weeks never responded to the company to

1661
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,720
the to the white hat hackers that told

1662
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,520
them that and this

1663
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,720
happens all the time um another type of

1664
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,000
attack is these uh

1665
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,040
you know if you've got a password

1666
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,799
uh anytime you type in a password login

1667
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,400
name with a password you can only guess

1668
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,119
a couple of

1669
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,440
times or maybe six times before it locks

1670
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,160
that account

1671
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,799
out well for whatever reason and every

1672
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,799
mfa implementation that requires you to

1673
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:25,680
put in a number

1674
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,680
a four digit code or a six digit code or

1675
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,280
whatever the

1676
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,200
version one of that software never has

1677
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,119
account lockout i don't know why but

1678
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,559
i've never seen mfa

1679
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,319
where you're required to put in a number

1680
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,680
that won't stop you

1681
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,480
from trying thousands of numbers you

1682
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,119
know so

1683
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,520
it's i don't know why it is but every

1684
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,599
implementation always that is that way

1685
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,119
this one researcher found that on

1686
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,200
instagram when instagram implemented

1687
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,599
uh mfa i think there was a four digit

1688
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,400
code

1689
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,359
which meant if you have four four digits

1690
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,640
um

1691
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,240
you know you're that would in nine

1692
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,680
numbers or ten numbers that means you

1693
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,799
can have up to like 10

1694
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,319
000 or 90 999 guesses or whatever

1695
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,960
um but he found that he could only guess

1696
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,520
uh he could guess up to 250 times by ip

1697
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,640
address so

1698
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,960
it didn't lock it out after six guesses

1699
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,920
it only locked it out after 250 guesses

1700
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,240
and

1701
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,319
only uh you know and the way that you

1702
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,359
could get more guesses

1703
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,119
is just to have a new ip address so he

1704
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,359
bought a bunch of computers for like 12

1705
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,280
bucks on amazon aws

1706
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,880
and guessed away and cracked and hacked

1707
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,480
it because

1708
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,280
their account lockout was 250. i mean

1709
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,880
everybody in the right mind would need

1710
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,359
250 and it happens all the time slack

1711
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,599
i use slack slack also at the same thing

1712
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,920
they had this password reset page

1713
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,680
that would send a code to somebody and

1714
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,359
it turned out you could brute force that

1715
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,000
code it

1716
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,240
never stopped you from guessing and it

1717
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,280
happened to

1718
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,760
cpanel which was really a popular admin

1719
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,760
console and it happened to

1720
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,760
you know this other this ua and it

1721
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,680
happened to grab android app

1722
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,799
i had never seen an mfa app that

1723
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,319
required a code that actually had

1724
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,079
account lockout on the number of times

1725
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,680
you could guess when it was out in the

1726
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,839
first version they always fix it

1727
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,200
but they don't know why they don't do

1728
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,720
account lockout all mfa is buggy as heck

1729
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,119
if you did you know all mfa is just

1730
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,319
software

1731
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,480
at some point and they all have bugs if

1732
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,520
you want to freak yourself

1733
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,760
out just put in buggy mfa code you'll

1734
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,680
get a million results back

1735
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,000
but it really happens all the time i

1736
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,440
love this headline here says

1737
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,200
after ignoring it for months uber

1738
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,680
finally fixes the two-factor bypass bug

1739
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,240
after all like literally this is not

1740
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,160
uncommon for when someone reports a bug

1741
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,240
with mfa that the vendors just don't fix

1742
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,200
it

1743
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,359
the biggest bug i ever remember was in

1744
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:42,000
2017 called the rocco vulnerability

1745
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,760
uh this involved public private key

1746
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,920
cryptography asymmetric cryptography if

1747
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,119
you know about public private key

1748
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:48,880
cryptographer the idea is that you and

1749
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,640
only you have a private key that nobody

1750
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,839
else sees

1751
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,920
and if anybody else was able to guess

1752
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,440
your private key they could

1753
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,720
become you it's attached to a related

1754
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,599
public key

1755
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,280
and that public key can be given out to

1756
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,680
anybody and it doesn't compromise your

1757
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,119
private key it's the whole way the whole

1758
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,000
thing works well

1759
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,599
turned out there is this vendor that

1760
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,000
made software and hardware

1761
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,119
made dynamic link library dll libraries

1762
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,200
that windows and other products used it

1763
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,319
made

1764
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,720
software that was put into firmware of

1765
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,520
chips

1766
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,200
well they when they generated rsa keys

1767
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,319
public keys 2048 bits are smaller which

1768
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,319
was almost all of them at the time

1769
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:29,920
turned out that they had a bug and if

1770
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,839
someone found your public key they could

1771
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,599
immediately generate your private key

1772
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,880
let me say this again

1773
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,520
they had a bug it was in hundreds of

1774
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,400
millions of devices it was in yuba keys

1775
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,400
it was in almost every smart card back

1776
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,920
in 2017

1777
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,599
it was in the trusted platform module

1778
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,040
chips with every enterprise

1779
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,160
uh windows laptop

1780
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,119
that if an attacker found was able to

1781
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,480
see your public key

1782
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,920
they could immediately generate your

1783
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,599
private key and

1784
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,480
it literally overnight made hundreds of

1785
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,880
millions of devices

1786
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,680
with no protection and these you know

1787
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,280
for a long time

1788
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,920
uh these devices with these flawed keys

1789
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,480
were out there most of them have expired

1790
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,119
now

1791
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,480
but there's still tens of hundreds of

1792
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,720
millions of these devices out there

1793
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,760
that's amazing uh just know

1794
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,680
on uh biometric attacks uh i've been on

1795
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,079
at least a dozen projects to hack

1796
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,000
fingerprints and retina scans

1797
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,319
and stuff like that i haven't done hand

1798
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,319
fingerprint geometry uh

1799
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,319
the the computer chaos club in germany

1800
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:35,599
did that one but

1801
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,440
when you're asked to fake fingerprints

1802
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,200
most of the time it's not hard at all

1803
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,079
like in every project i've ever been on

1804
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,040
the projects

1805
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,280
are assigned to go on for two weeks six

1806
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,240
weeks something like that

1807
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,079
we've never not broken in the

1808
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,400
fingerprint using the first thing we

1809
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,040
tried

1810
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,599
on the first day i fake fingerprints

1811
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,440
with play-doh i've fake fingerprints

1812
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,480
with glue i

1813
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,000
think fingerprints with all kinds of

1814
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,240
materials my favorite though is

1815
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,160
uh one project we had a bunch of those

1816
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,920
flat scanners you know that's where you

1817
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,640
kind of like

1818
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,240
usually use your building entry where

1819
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,000
you just put your fingerprint across it

1820
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,599
not the swipe scanner but where you

1821
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,880
place your finger

1822
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,240
we found out that we could spray

1823
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,400
fingerprint spray

1824
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,359
dust and it would raise the oil and make

1825
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,280
it so that we then could log in as that

1826
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,640
fingerprint so we just went up to any

1827
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,839
fingerprint scanner

1828
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,599
sprayed it with fingerprint dust and it

1829
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,599
would log in as that fingerprint

1830
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,040
and even worse some of them we could

1831
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,640
just go to the fingerprint and go

1832
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,359
just puff wet air on it and activate the

1833
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:33,920
oils of

1834
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,160
us fingerprint and log us in as that

1835
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,200
person

1836
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,440
uh there you know the vendors always go

1837
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,119
you can't fake him you can't fake it you

1838
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,559
can't take our fingerprints you can't

1839
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:43,839
fake our facial scans

1840
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,599
there's always some kid the next day on

1841
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,839
youtube faking that biometric thing for

1842
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,040
like two bucks

1843
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,960
like here's where facial recognition

1844
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,680
doesn't work as intended on 42 of 110

1845
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,880
tested smartphones

1846
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,240
you don't have to worry it was only

1847
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,680
lenovo lg nokia and samsung

1848
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,280
you know and then iphones are not on

1849
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,960
that list but iphones can they be

1850
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,200
can you fake fingerprints on iphones yes

1851
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,680
yes and face scans and all this stuff

1852
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:08,799
they can all be

1853
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,040
fake uh last two things i'll talk about

1854
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,160
here because i know i'm running out of

1855
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,599
time here

1856
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,640
is if your secret encryption key is

1857
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,680
stored on a

1858
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,240
chip you can actually get an electron

1859
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,839
microscope a brand new electron

1860
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,599
microscope costs about a million bucks

1861
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:24,960
you can buy one on the internet for

1862
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,040
about five thousand bucks and if that

1863
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,640
secret key is on a chip

1864
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,799
like the trusted platform module chip is

1865
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,480
on windows laptops

1866
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,000
you can actually use an electron

1867
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,079
microscope with open source software

1868
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,440
there's open source software you can

1869
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,000
download

1870
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,839
that will look in the chip find the tpm

1871
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:42,480
key

1872
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,440
and tell you how to unlock the tpm chip

1873
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,040
you know they literally these electron

1874
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,119
microscopes find the secret keys

1875
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,760
looking at the molecular levels so

1876
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,760
anytime you have an encryption product

1877
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,680
the secret key has to be stored

1878
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,119
somewhere in memory

1879
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,400
on this somewhere an electron microscope

1880
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,079
can get it if you can't afford five or

1881
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,359
six thousand dollars for electron

1882
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,520
microscope can you afford eight bucks

1883
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,039
because for eight bucks you can actually

1884
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:09,599
get a can of a duster air

1885
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,359
and this attack called the cold blue

1886
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,880
attack you can look this up i've

1887
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,119
actually seen this done in real life

1888
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,880
is that what they found out is that you

1889
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,799
can go up to someone's laptop

1890
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:21,039
that is locked that's encrypted with

1891
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,200
like bitlocker or something

1892
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,200
open up the memory compartment where the

1893
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,640
memory chips are

1894
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,119
spray that area for a minute with this

1895
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,880
duster air what it will do is make those

1896
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,160
chips very cold it gets

1897
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,920
nice and frosty you can remove those

1898
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,359
memory chips put them in another

1899
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,160
computer

1900
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,359
and find the secret keys it's called

1901
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,119
you take a look cold boot attack it's

1902
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,039
been done against all kinds of

1903
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,520
it works against any encryption product

1904
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,760
where the entire secret key

1905
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,760
is stored in memory or on a disk and

1906
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,039
it's not a split key

1907
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,880
type thing it works against apple works

1908
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,039
against linux works against windows

1909
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,480
and it just takes eight dollars of

1910
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,240
canned air and you download open source

1911
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,280
software

1912
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,960
so the thing i want you to remember is

1913
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,440
just mfa isn't unhackable

1914
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,200
it doesn't prevent fishing or social

1915
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,039
engineering from being successful

1916
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,960
mfa is good though everybody should use

1917
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,160
it when they can but it's not

1918
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,119
unbreakable

1919
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,359
if you use mfa you just need to be aware

1920
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,200
of the types of attacks that could get

1921
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,599
around your mfa or be successful against

1922
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,280
your mfa

1923
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,200
and so with that said i know i'm running

1924
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,960
out of time here but i'd love to take

1925
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,160
some questions from you on that

1926
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,640
well thank you thank you for that

1927
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,240
presentation that was pretty amazing

1928
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,319
let's go ahead and um

1929
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:35,440
let's start looking at

1930
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,920
so he says here to avoid an mfa attack

1931
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,960
with shortening sessions uh

1932
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,079
i guess the timeout help

1933
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,839
yeah i mean it's gonna help a little bit

1934
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,280
but so i can hack

1935
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,240
any mfa solution at least three to five

1936
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:52,640
ways

1937
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,920
i can hack most of them 10 plus ways so

1938
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,280
for you know

1939
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,960
you can just hack them i mean you can

1940
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,960
just hack them in different ways

1941
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,039
but uh shortening the session key will

1942
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,400
help but

1943
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,880
i mean they can automate it a lot of the

1944
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,440
attacks

1945
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,839
automate the mfa attack so it happens in

1946
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,440
a second or two and then they change

1947
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,280
your email address change your password

1948
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,480
and things like that

1949
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,720
so you know you really can't make the

1950
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,400
session so short that they wouldn't be

1951
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,079
able to accomplish what they wanted to

1952
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:20,720
do

1953
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,400
you know you'd want to look at something

1954
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,240
else to try to be more protective

1955
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,280
like again i'm a big fan of fido 2

1956
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,000
because 502 says that the device that's

1957
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,920
used it generates a separate public

1958
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,440
private key

1959
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,079
that then is attached to a website and

1960
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:37,599
it won't work with the man in the middle

1961
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:38,559
site so like

1962
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,839
so for 90 of mfa google authenticator

1963
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,599
windows authenticator rsa

1964
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,839
all these a lot of products you could

1965
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,920
trick with the man-to-middle attack

1966
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,079
fido doesn't because it registers both

1967
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,760
sides and it won't work it won't be

1968
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,440
registered with a man in the middle of

1969
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,039
sight so it just doesn't work

1970
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,559
so i love fighter 2 but i can hack

1971
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,240
fighter 2 a bunch of different ways as

1972
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,400
well

1973
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,440
right what is your opinion of of the

1974
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,599
titan keys

1975
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,640
uh you know the ones that are fido2 are

1976
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,359
good uh

1977
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,400
they're good i mean again i uh

1978
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,680
and there's titan keys and there's

1979
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,760
google titan keys um

1980
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,839
but they're they're typically like fido

1981
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,319
based or time one time based of best

1982
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:22,480
they're actually a pretty good solution

1983
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,480
are they unhackable no not by any means

1984
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,720
but they're good on the on the standard

1985
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,680
of things i

1986
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,680
actually like i would say titans above

1987
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,440
average about what i would like

1988
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,039
but you know it's even like the fido

1989
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,160
keys but there's fido and fido 2 and

1990
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,799
yuba keys yuba keys and titan keys kind

1991
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,359
of fight it out sometimes

1992
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:46,240
there's lots of hacks against yuba keys

1993
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,680
and a lot of those attacks would have

1994
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,599
been successful against the titan keys

1995
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,680
except for titan came out later but you

1996
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,480
know

1997
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,119
you know you know for sure and i think

1998
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,319
in the book i think i do

1999
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,880
include a attack against titan in the

2000
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,799
book it's been patched now

2001
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,799
but you know everything gets bugs

2002
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,000
everything can be hacked

2003
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,359
but i like them above average

2004
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,839
great um any other question

2005
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,760
okay i'll ask another question do you

2006
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,400
think that

2007
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,599
sierra trust is is good to mitigate this

2008
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,079
type of attacks or

2009
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,079
yeah that actually i talk about that in

2010
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,200
my book

2011
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,039
um it was interesting i actually take

2012
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,480
the most secure

2013
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,880
mfa device known on the planet which is

2014
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,920
a bloomberg

2015
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,400
device it's like this five factor device

2016
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,160
and i hack it in the book

2017
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,079
and then i say what would it take to

2018
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,200
secure

2019
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,599
uh something actually secure online

2020
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:44,640
voting from home

2021
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,079
it's actually one of the chapters let's

2022
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,520
take the most difficult scenario in the

2023
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,880
world and secure it

2024
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,480
but the uh you know uh i'm sorry what

2025
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,119
was your question

2026
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,680
i lost myself what was that question if

2027
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,039
if cyril trust

2028
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,079
like yeah so i finished

2029
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,720
the book with you know what what's the

2030
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,039
future of authentication and it's closer

2031
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:05,440
to

2032
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,079
what xero trust looks like you know it's

2033
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:08,559
kind of

2034
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,280
in zero trust first of all people use it

2035
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,480
just as a catch word

2036
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,680
kind of like when they call something

2037
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,359
quantum people love to call things zero

2038
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:16,319
trusts that aren't zero

2039
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,000
trust and they oh it's quantum it's not

2040
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,839
quantum but

2041
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:21,520
you know i always say zero trust is kind

2042
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,119
of like your credit card which is

2043
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,720
you can use your credit card and it

2044
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,720
works most of the time but then every

2045
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,520
now and then

2046
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,200
your bank like maybe you're buying a

2047
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,280
large screen tv at best buy

2048
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,880
and your credit card come and go hey is

2049
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,280
this really you well xero trust is kind

2050
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,000
of that way

2051
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,480
it uses the combination of things to do

2052
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,240
a trust rating on you

2053
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,480
so like you know the one thing i think

2054
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,400
will be integral to all xero trust is

2055
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,240
are you coming from the same device that

2056
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,839
you normally come from

2057
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,760
you know are you coming from the same

2058
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,599
location that you're normally from or

2059
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:52,880
same ip address

2060
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,000
are you doing the types of transactions

2061
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
so the future of authentication is

2062
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,440
probably not mfa

2063
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,680
or passwords it's probably going to be

2064
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,839
something what's called frictionless

2065
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:06,000
and zero trust yeah so the future of

2066
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,839
authentication is something that looks a

2067
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:09,599
lot more like zero trust

2068
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,920
which looks at the amalgam of everything

2069
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,799
that you're doing

2070
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,799
and that you are to decide whether

2071
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,960
you're doing high risk or low risk

2072
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,040
things or behaviors or contacts and

2073
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,920
again microsoft and google are already

2074
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,158
already evaluating hundreds of variables

2075
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:26,080
on you every time you log into their

2076
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,080
accounts and you don't know it

2077
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,759
because they get like a million accounts

2078
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,600
stolen every day every day

2079
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,839
microsoft and google have a million

2080
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,158
accounts stolen by hackers

2081
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:37,920
so they've come up with some really

2082
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,279
sophisticated forms

2083
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,120
to try to fight it they're not perfect

2084
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,120
but yeah so you asked about how i like

2085
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:43,839
zero trust

2086
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:45,600
for the things that really are zero

2087
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,679
trust i like a lot but there's a lot of

2088
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:48,880
false stuff out there

2089
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,399
i think everything's like we're zero

2090
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,000
trust i'm like no you're just

2091
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,290
no trust

2092
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:55,120
[Laughter]

2093
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:00,158
cool guys any other questions

2094
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:05,198
i was just gonna save uh you can show us

2095
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:06,319
your book um

2096
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,600
so everybody you know

2097
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,080
yeah yeah please yeah if you yeah

2098
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,679
certainly uh can't hurt if you want to

2099
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:14,880
look at it or

2100
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,238
buy it it's called a hacking

2101
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,880
multi-factor authentication

2102
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,520
and it's a good book it's a it is uh

2103
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,120
it's a good book it just came out

2104
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,839
uh i think november december of last

2105
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:26,640
year

2106
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,359
uh but it's i even talked about how like

2107
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,080
how you can

2108
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,399
how how to pick the best mfa for you or

2109
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:33,600
your company

2110
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,359
like what is the process you should go

2111
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,799
because that's a very common question

2112
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,880
like what mfa should i get

2113
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,319
there's a lot of things that go into it

2114
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,799
number one is is what does it work with

2115
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,158
like some people i like google

2116
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,759
authenticator google authenticator

2117
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:46,960
doesn't work with two percent of the

2118
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,198
websites and services in this world

2119
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:50,479
you know and it's one of the biggest so

2120
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,080
you have to start first you have to say

2121
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,759
what am i trying to protect

2122
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:55,600
and then try to figure out what mfa

2123
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,280
solutions would even protect what i'm

2124
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,480
trying to protect

2125
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,239
then i start to ask well do i want a

2126
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,560
hardware token do i want biometric you

2127
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:02,960
know

2128
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,480
but you gotta ask a couple other bigger

2129
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,080
questions even before you get to the

2130
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,199
actual solution

2131
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,760
um a a question that always comes to

2132
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,640
to you know people have asked us in the

2133
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,679
past uh

2134
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:20,480
between like google authenticator and uh

2135
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:20,800
like

2136
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,920
uh microsoft authenticator and like

2137
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,800
alfie

2138
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,040
you know like do you have a preference

2139
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,719
you have a recommendation

2140
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,239
uh you know yeah so you know all those

2141
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,920
are all i think middle solutions i

2142
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,960
hacked them all

2143
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,600
or you know and they've all been hacked

2144
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,600
multiple multiple times all these been

2145
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,320
hacked you know

2146
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,800
it's the longer you've been around the

2147
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,560
more popular there are the more

2148
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,360
you get hacked and so what i say with a

2149
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,239
lot of those

2150
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,880
is you know as long as when they get

2151
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,159
when someone identifies that they've

2152
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,199
been hacked

2153
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,120
and they fix it fairly quickly you know

2154
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,719
it's like windows or google brow you

2155
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:57,040
know

2156
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,400
microsoft edge and google chrome get

2157
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,000
hacked all the time but they're pretty

2158
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,760
quick on fixing it you want the same

2159
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,480
thing with your

2160
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,360
authentication and autho has been hacked

2161
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,159
to death

2162
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:10,320
and off he's been hacked to death and

2163
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,600
google authenticator

2164
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,080
gets hacked to that but most of the time

2165
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,159
the google authenticator is a weird one

2166
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:17,520
at times right there's a lot of a whole

2167
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,679
lot of stolen that code gets stolen man

2168
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,120
and middle attacks

2169
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,199
and they could fix it by requiring

2170
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,719
device registration

2171
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,600
like the fido keys do my bad fidos i'm a

2172
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,400
big i love

2173
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,880
anything that's fido based 502 based i

2174
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,520
love

2175
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,360
and you can still hack them but one of

2176
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,040
the things i love about fido 2 is they

2177
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,560
actually they're one of the few vendors

2178
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,159
that actually puts out a document going

2179
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:39,760
here's the ways you can hack our

2180
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,880
products

2181
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,800
and you know and here's the way you can

2182
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,480
prevent those hacks i mean

2183
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,560
that that to me gives me confidence that

2184
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,120
that's a fairly secure solution

2185
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,880
uh but they're you know they're all good

2186
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,040
they're all bad at times the ones that i

2187
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,440
there's more that i don't like like so

2188
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,199
if you uh the ones you mentioned

2189
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:00,560
i like they're in the middle um they use

2190
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,560
open standards they're not there's a lot

2191
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,560
of them that roll their own crypto

2192
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,199
run away from those i'm not a big fan of

2193
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:08,239
sms bay

2194
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,719
i'm not a fan of biometrics especially

2195
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,480
if it's single factor which is

2196
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,640
pretty common uh but there are some

2197
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,080
biometric like i'm worried about

2198
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,840
biometrics if your fingerprints get

2199
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,719
stolen

2200
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,040
uh but there are there are like when you

2201
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,400
do a fingerprint scan

2202
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,719
what happens is it takes the the ridges

2203
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,880
and valleys of your fingerprints

2204
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,199
and it makes every ridge and valley a

2205
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,120
point so that your fingerprint

2206
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,640
actually gets converted to something

2207
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,360
that looks like a star constellation

2208
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,320
and that star constellation is what gets

2209
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,120
scanned in

2210
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,840
and stored as what it gets scanned

2211
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,880
against

2212
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,480
and your fingerprints cannot be super

2213
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:46,880
really

2214
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,040
accurately read because every day you're

2215
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,560
getting micro abrasion

2216
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,280
so most fingerprint scanners are capable

2217
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:53,920
of doing

2218
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,199
far more uh detailed scanning

2219
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,360
but they can't do the scanning that

2220
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,560
detail so they actually

2221
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,360
intentionally detune them so that that

2222
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:03,840
star

2223
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,159
constellation essentially gets to look

2224
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,760
like a lot of other people's star

2225
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,560
consolation

2226
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,239
that my company had know before when i

2227
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,239
first joined and i put my fingerprint in

2228
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,320
we only had four or 500 employees at the

2229
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,000
time and my fingerprint already matched

2230
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,600
somebody else's fingerprint

2231
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,960
well when i looked at that person's

2232
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,640
fingerprint it didn't look anything like

2233
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,480
my fingerprint it's just that our star

2234
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,360
constellation

2235
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,600
when they detuned it just happened to

2236
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,400
match

2237
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,239
and if you talk to anybody in the like

2238
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,000
that's done a hundred thousand people

2239
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,520
for biometrics

2240
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,840
not only there are people that just

2241
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,640
can't use

2242
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,719
the biometrics like even at no before we

2243
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,320
had a thousand employees there's a girl

2244
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,199
that every day

2245
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:42,560
her fingerprint would not match it

2246
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,960
it just wouldn't match like and we don't

2247
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,480
know why she didn't

2248
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,600
she wasn't a drummer she didn't mess

2249
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,840
with paints and clays and sandpaper for

2250
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,480
a living

2251
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,920
and if you talk to someone that's done

2252
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,000
really big biometric projects there's

2253
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,080
always people that just don't work the

2254
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,679
retina scan doesn't work their hand

2255
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:00,800
point you know you have to make

2256
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,320
exceptions for them

2257
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,679
so um my thing is use a

2258
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:07,280
use a company that's been around a while

2259
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,719
all the ones you just said have been

2260
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,239
around for a while

2261
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:13,360
that try to fix the bugs

2262
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,640
that try to to do so but let me say this

2263
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,320
like the people the big cryptocurrency

2264
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,120
people they've been robbed so many times

2265
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,960
a lot of my cryptocurrency friends went

2266
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,040
back the login name and password

2267
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,440
they're like literally if i have a login

2268
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,440
name and password for coinbase

2269
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,679
and if i don't i will never ever get

2270
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:32,960
tricked to giving it out

2271
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,040
and if i do that i'm not going to be

2272
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,760
hacked but their mfa solution

2273
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,239
was hacked over and over and over and

2274
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,520
over again so a lot of the big

2275
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,440
cryptocurrency guys have like stopped

2276
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:43,920
using

2277
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,560
mfa so you know that's kind of the

2278
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,000
problem is that

2279
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,040
mfa is not the uh

2280
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,159
the be all end-all you know it's good

2281
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,560
but let me you probably don't want to

2282
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,120
completely trust your all your gold

2283
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,480
to an mfa solution

2284
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,239
yeah somebody's asking about the jewelry

2285
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,480
key was what's your opinion on the

2286
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,679
giveaway key

2287
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,040
uh the yuba key i like them they get

2288
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,000
hacked a lot

2289
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,960
uh a lot of different ways um but if

2290
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:15,600
they support

2291
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,320
fido two i like them they're good but

2292
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,120
they're you know

2293
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,640
they're hacked like anybody else but if

2294
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,880
you tell me you've got a yuba key

2295
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,440
especially one a newer one because their

2296
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,120
older ones got hacked they even had the

2297
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,440
roka vulnerability impacted a lot of the

2298
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,159
version one yuba keys uh i like yuba

2299
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:32,719
keys

2300
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,400
although i don't like the single factor

2301
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,320
ones there's a lot of yuba keys

2302
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,560
where you just plug them in or you plug

2303
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,080
them in and push a button

2304
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,080
those are horrible that means that if

2305
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,760
you lose that yuba key

2306
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,480
anybody that picks it up becomes you

2307
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,360
there's actually

2308
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,040
and i recount this in the book there is

2309
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,880
a hardwood study

2310
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,719
where they did yuba keys and they had

2311
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,080
100 people

2312
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,600
and they sent them some instructions of

2313
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,600
how to use the yuba keys to log into

2314
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,880
gmail

2315
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,800
something like 40 or 50 percent of the

2316
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,400
people used them wrong

2317
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,840
it was like 20 percent of the people

2318
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,360
thought they were using it right but

2319
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,560
weren't using it at

2320
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,640
all some people put them and plugged

2321
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,719
them in upside down some people damaged

2322
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:11,360
them

2323
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,719
some people thought the little push

2324
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,679
button was a fingerprint scanner

2325
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:16,880
and that they thought they were working

2326
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,040
the whole time but they were not working

2327
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,199
so they had this like hideous failure

2328
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:23,199
rate for a single factor

2329
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:26,239
yubikey and that told me anything harder

2330
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,159
than single factor yuba key you're going

2331
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,600
to have failures

2332
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,760
with people but here's the wildest thing

2333
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,960
at the end of this

2334
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,760
study they actually gave all

2335
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,360
participants i said thank you so much

2336
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,040
and we're going to give you the yuba key

2337
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,719
you get to use that human key for the

2338
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,080
rest of your life or whatever

2339
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,920
they waited two months called them back

2340
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,760
all hundred people

2341
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,760
had not used it all hundred people

2342
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,199
decided not to use it

2343
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,120
they didn't want to be bothered by using

2344
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,120
it because it was too hard to use and

2345
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,280
you plugged it in and pushed a button

2346
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,120
on top of that something like 40 percent

2347
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,960
of the people gave it away

2348
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,560
they thought it was a memory storage

2349
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,080
device and they gave them to their

2350
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,080
friends to their kids or put it in like

2351
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,440
a common company

2352
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,159
storage bin meaning whoever then picked

2353
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,920
it up if they used it

2354
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:14,800
would log in as them like it's insane

2355
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,600
so i'm a big believer on two-factor uh

2356
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,719
mfa

2357
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,560
and a lot of people think that yuba keys

2358
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,040
are always mfa not a single factor

2359
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,560
and i i don't like single factor

2360
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:30,480
great um is one question here i think

2361
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,560
you touch on it but if you could

2362
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,760
if you could uh wrap it up with like set

2363
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,199
of practices that you

2364
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,400
recommend uh which obviously

2365
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,159
a lot of them are in the book but if you

2366
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:43,520
if you were to choose

2367
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,199
at least three that everybody should

2368
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:48,800
consider uh when thinking about mfa

2369
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,800
yes uh yeah one i just mentioned which

2370
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,120
is try to use a reputable company

2371
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:57,040
that uses open standards you know so 502

2372
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,920
yuba key tells me uses 502 i like it and

2373
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,679
it's been around and make sure that it's

2374
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,760
a responsive company

2375
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,280
there are the vast majority of

2376
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,920
mfa vendors out there or fly by night

2377
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,440
have almost no customers

2378
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,640
so you want to use a bigger mfa customer

2379
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,000
that people have heard of

2380
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,280
and used and i think it's sad if you're

2381
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:19,760
a new

2382
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,080
mfa vendor i'm telling people to avoid

2383
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:22,800
you

2384
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,480
and that's not a good thing but you just

2385
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,080
you know they're not proven you don't

2386
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,760
know what their security policies are

2387
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,960
you don't know if they're gonna update

2388
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:31,600
but

2389
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,640
on top of that uh i'm also the biggest

2390
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,320
thing to get out of this

2391
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,280
is to educate yourself and anybody you

2392
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,080
give mfa

2393
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,360
to like if i give somebody uh google

2394
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,920
authenticator or microsoft authenticator

2395
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,600
or linkedin mfa i would as an

2396
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,280
administrator i go listen

2397
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,600
you still could be tricked out of your

2398
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,480
mfa

2399
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,239
you know like you could the email could

2400
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,159
send you to the wrong website and it

2401
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,000
looks like the right website

2402
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,320
so you need to pay attention to the link

2403
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,000
you're clicking on to make sure it's a

2404
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,199
real link

2405
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:08,239
if i'm giving some if uh sms based if

2406
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,080
all of a sudden we're using sms

2407
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,040
based mfa which i again tell you you

2408
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,679
shouldn't

2409
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:15,600
but i would tell people listen if you

2410
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,520
get a code

2411
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,520
telling you to put in another code to

2412
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,960
some other sms message

2413
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,960
you're being tricked or if someone calls

2414
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,560
you on the phone claiming to be

2415
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,239
us or claiming to be google or microsoft

2416
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:30,239
you do not know that it really is google

2417
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:31,360
and microsoft so

2418
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,000
my biggest recommendation it's in every

2419
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:34,560
chapter

2420
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,840
and every chapter i go here's the

2421
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,199
solution here's the solution i put all

2422
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:37,920
solutions

2423
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,280
the first bullet point every time is

2424
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,679
education because

2425
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,760
so many people think that oh i got nfa i

2426
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,679
don't need to worry i just plug it in or

2427
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,760
buy a metric or i've got a yuba key or

2428
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,360
titan key i'm safe

2429
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,920
and you're not it just requires it's

2430
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,440
like people's brains

2431
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,360
it's as if we gave people passwords went

2432
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,280
ah go use your password it's safe

2433
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,800
no when we give people passwords like

2434
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,320
hey we're never going to ask you for it

2435
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:00,560
in an

2436
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,400
email we're never going to call and ask

2437
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,080
you for it and there's a lot of ways

2438
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,520
you'll be tricked out of it i mean

2439
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,199
same thing with mfa is you just have to

2440
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,040
give a little bit of guidance that's my

2441
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,400
number one

2442
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,480
and then go with a restful a referable

2443
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,679
solution

2444
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:15,760
uh with somebody that uses open

2445
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:17,920
standards that would just be in general

2446
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,480
although

2447
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,040
i'm doing my uh on march 8th at my

2448
